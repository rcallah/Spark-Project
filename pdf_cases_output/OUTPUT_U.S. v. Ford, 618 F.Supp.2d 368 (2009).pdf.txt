informant  arranged  to  purchase  cocaine  base
outside  restaurant,  so  as  to  support  defendant's
conviction  for  distributing  five  or  more  grams
of  cocaine  base;  despite  the  lack  of  recordings
or  contemporaneous  documentation,  informant
testified that defendant gave him a half-ounce of
cocaine base in exchange for $400, and telephone
conversation  that  day  between  informant  and
defendant showed that defendant agreed to sell

jeopardize the defendant's right to be tried solely
on the basis of the evidence presented to the jury,
and  the  prosecutor's  opinion  carries  with  it  the
imprimatur of the government and may induce
the jury to trust the government's judgment rather

OPINION

POLLAK, District Judge.

Before  the  court  is  defendant  Harold  Ford's  motion  to  set
aside the verdict on count one of the government's two-count
indictment. A jury found Ford guilty of distributing five or

more  grams  of  cocaine  base,  in  violation  of  21  U.S.C.  §§
841(a)(1), (b)(1)(b), on November 10, 2005 (Count 1 of the
indictment), but acquitted him of count two, distributing five
or  more  grams  of  cocaine  base  in  a  separate  incident  on
November 17, 2005 (Count 2). Ford moves for a judgment
of  acquittal  on  count  one,  pursuant  to  Rule  29(c)  of  the
Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, contending that there
was not sufficient evidence to support the jury's guilty verdict.
Alternatively, in his Rule 29 motion, Ford seeks acquittal on
Count 1 on grounds of prosecutorial misconduct. 1

I. Background
In  November  2005,  a  Drug  Enforcement  Administration
(“DEA”)  task  force  composed  of  DEA  agents  and  local
police  *372   officers  was  investigating  drug  trafficking
activities in Coatesville, Pennsylvania. Eleven months later,
in October 2006, members of the task force arrested Harold
Ford; in November 2006, a grand jury returned a two-count
indictment. 2   The  charges  were  based  on  drugs  allegedly
distributed to a confidential informant, Kevin McKinley.

II. Sufficiency of the Evidence
Ford  argues  that  the  evidence  presented  to  the  jury  was
insufficient  to  prove,  as  the  indictment  charged,  that  he
distributed “cocaine base (‘crack’)” on November 10, 2005.
“In addressing this claim,” the jury's verdict must be upheld
“if there is substantial evidence from which a rational trier
of fact could find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.” United
States  v.  Miller,  527  F.3d  54,  60  (3d  Cir.2008)  (internal
quotation marks omitted). This inquiry requires that the court
“interpret  the  evidence  in  the  light  most  favorable  to  the
government  as  the  verdict  winner,  and  do[es]  not  weigh
evidence or determine the credibility of witnesses in making
[its]  determination.”  Id.  (citations  and  internal  quotation
marks omitted).

A.
The  evidence  relevant  to  the  count-one  distribution  charge
is  as  follows:  In  the  fall  of  2005,  the  DEA  task  force
obtained  the  cooperation  of  a  then-confidential  source,
Kevin  McKinley,  in  staging  undercover  drug  purchases.
McKinley,  a  Coatesville  resident  with  a  lengthy  criminal
history,  including  a  conviction  for  drug  distribution, 3   had
been arrested on September 5, 2005, and again on October

31,  2005,  for  distributing  crack  cocaine.  Docket  No.  80
(Transcript  of  Trial,  January  25,  2008)  at  64.  One  of
McKinley's arresting officers on October 31, Corporal Chris
McEvoy, a Coatesville narcotics officer working with the task
force, solicited McKinley's cooperation with the task force's
investigation. DEA Agent Brent Wood, who supervised the
task force's investigation, testified that, in exchange for his
cooperation, McKinley was promised that he would not face
state  or  federal  charges  in  connection  with  the  September
and October 2005 arrests. Docket No. 80 (Transcript of Trial,
January 25, 2008) at 167.

McKinley's  cooperation  began  with  an 
interview  on
November  7,  2005  about  drug  trafficking  in  Coatesville.
The  interview  was  conducted  in  part  by  Sergeant  William
Farley,  an  officer  of  the  University  of  Pennsylvania  Police
Department  (“UPPD”).  Sergeant  Farley  began  working  for
the UPPD in 2001, after having spent a year working with
the  park  police  in  Delaware  County.  Docket  No.  79  at  39.
At  the  time  that  Sergeant  Farley  interviewed  McKinley,  in
2005, Farley was assigned to a DEA task force concurrently
with  his  UPPD  responsibilities.  Docket  No.  79  at  39.  On
November 10, 2005, based on information obtained during
the November 7 interview, Sergeant Farley fitted McKinley
with  a  recording  device  and  listened  as  McKinley  made
several  *373  calls to negotiate drug purchases. 4  Docket No.
79 at 39–42.

One  of  these  calls,  which  was  played  for  the  jury  during
Sergeant  Farley's  cross–examination,  was  made  to  Joe
Martinez, a local drug dealer, at 11:49 a.m. During this call,
McKinley arranged to purchase a half-ounce of crack cocaine
in about forty minutes. Docket No. 79 at 81–83. According
to Sergeant Farley's testimony, McKinley's conversation with
Martinez  included  discussion  of  both  the  quantity  and  the
price of the drugs that were to be purchased. Docket No. 79
at  83,  89.  McKinley  also  called  another  local  drug  dealer,
Fredrick  (“Freddie”)  Williams,  to  arrange  the  purchase  of
crack cocaine.

McKinley  made  a  third  call,  at  approximately  11:55  a.m.
Docket No. 79 at 83–85. This conversation was played for
the jury during Sergeant Farley's direct examination. The jury
was given a transcript of the conversation that read as follows:

SPEAKER 1: Hello

SPEAKER 2: Yo where you at?

SPEAKER 1: I am just pulling up I just got here they had
me there all morning man.

SPEAKER 2: Oh you just now ... how did you make out?

REDACTED

SPEAKER 2: I am ready to come down there, I need you
man

SPEAKER 1: What's up?

—

SPEAKER 2: I need that I need that A-stem

OR

I need that I need that H-town 5

SPEAKER 1: Alright

SPEAKER 2: Where you at?

SPEAKER  1:  I  am  down  at  the  Midway  ordering  my
grill right now.

SPEAKER 2: Alright is my sister down there ... hugh

SPEAKER 1: She ain't here

SPEAKER 2: Alright I will be down

SPEAKER 1: Alright

Gov't  Exh.  N–29.  On  direct  examination,  McKinley
testified that he was the person identified as “speaker 2,”
and Harold Ford was “speaker 1.” Docket No. 80 at 24.

After  these  conversations,  McKinley,  outfitted  with  a
concealed transmitter and recording device, and supplied with
$400  in  “buy  money,”  was  dropped  off  in  an  alley  near
the  Midway  Diner,  the  restaurant  referred  to  in  the  above
conversation. Docket No. 79 at 46–47, 157. McKinley walked
to the Midway Diner and arrived there at approximately 12:20
p.m., according to Sergeant Farley's testimony. 6  At  *374
trial,  McKinley  testified  that  Ford  was  standing  in  front  of
the Midway when he arrived, and that he and Ford discussed

the  purchase  of  half  an  ounce  of  crack  cocaine.  According
to  McKinley,  Ford  instructed  McKinley  to  wait  while  he
went  to  get  the  drugs;  McKinley  further  testified  that  he
“remember[ed] [Ford] taking too long,” and called him to see
where he was. 7  Docket No. 79 at 158.

However,  Sergeant  Farley,  who  had  listened  to  all  of
McKinley's  recorded  conversations  on  November  10,
testified  on  cross-examination  that  there  was  no  record  of
a  conversation  between  McKinley  and  Ford  discussing  the
quantity  or  price  of  drugs.  Docket  No.  79  at  93,  95–96.
Sergeant  Farley  also  testified  that  he  had  no  record  of
McKinley calling Ford on his cell phone while McKinley was
waiting at the Midway Diner. Docket No. 79 at 96. Sergeant
Farley further testified that McKinley could not turn off the
transmitter or recording device that he was carrying, and that
all conversations between McKinley and Ford should have
been recorded. Docket No. 79 at 76.

McKinley testified that he had not gone inside the Midway
Diner before meeting Ford or while waiting for him to return.
Docket  No.  79  at  160.  Sergeant  Farley,  however,  testified
that, according to his contemporaneous notes (see footnote 6,
supra ), Kevin McKinley, on arriving at the Midway Diner,
entered  and  remained  inside  for  less  than  two  minutes. 8
Docket No. 79 at 87–88. No members of the task force were
conducting surveillance inside the Midway Diner. Docket No.
79 at 87–88.

McKinley  testified  that,  about  five  or  ten  minutes  after  he
called Ford while waiting for him outside the Midway Diner,
Ford  returned.  “[Ford]  came  back  walking  down  the  street
and  came  back  to  me  in  front  of  the  Midway,  and  walked
west  [to]  east  on  the  Midway,  like  off  to  the  side  back
towards the alley I came from. That's when he handed it to
me.” Docket No. 79 at 158. McKinley testified that he paid
$400 to Ford and received half an ounce of crack cocaine,
Docket No. 79 at 160–61, and that the transaction occurred
through a handshake: “He shakes my hand, give me the stuff,
I shake his hand back, give him the money.” Docket No. 79 at
161. Overall, according to McKinley's testimony, twenty or
twenty-five minutes elapsed between initially meeting Ford
outside the Midway Diner and the transaction taking place.
Docket No. 79 at 159.

Corporal  McEvoy  testified  to  having  observed  Ford  and
McKinley  outside  the  Midway  Diner.  Driving  in  a  vehicle
different from Sergeant Farley's (six task force vehicles were
involved in the operation, Docket No. 79 at 44–45), Corporal
McEvoy  staked  out  a  position  about  a  block  and  a  half  to
two blocks east of the Midway Diner to conduct surveillance
of McKinley.  *375   9  Docket No. 80 at 98–100. Corporal
McEvoy  testified,  on  cross-examination,  that  this  position
was  across  a  “very  busy  intersection”  from  the  Midway
Diner  and  that  there  were  always  “a  lot  of  people  on  the
street” at the location. Docket No. 80 at 126–27. According
to  Corporal  McEvoy,  he  saw  McKinley  walk  toward  the
Midway Diner and then meet and engage in a conversation
with Ford. Docket No. 80 at 100. Corporal McEvoy said that
he observed Ford walking north from the restaurant toward
Merchant Street. Docket No. 80 at 100–01. Then, according
to Corporal McEvoy, he lost sight of Ford for “a number of
minutes”  but  saw  Ford  once  more  as  he  walked  south  and
met McKinley again in front of the Midway Diner. Docket
No. 80 at 101–02. Corporal McEvoy testified that Ford and
McKinley then shook hands and separated after a few more
seconds. However, Corporal McEvoy acknowledged that he
did not actually observe drugs or money transferred during
this  handshake,  but  added  that,  in  his  experience,  shaking
hands is “indicative of a drug transaction.” 10  Docket No. 80
at 119.

During Sergeant Farley's cross-examination, Ford's counsel
played  a  recording  of  a  12:46  p.m.  conversation  between
McKinley, who was then still in the vicinity of the Midway
Diner, and a person the task force could not identify. Docket
No.  79  at  89–91.  The  recording  included  discussion  of
prices—“350, 370, 380” dollars—and references to “scales.”
Docket No. 79 at 91. McKinley testified that this conversation
occurred while he was waiting for Ford to return, and that he
and the speaker in the conversation were discussing prices for
a half ounce of crack cocaine. McKinley further testified that
he did not remember the name of the person with whom he
had this conversation, but that the person was “some young
guy.” Docket No. 80 at 18–20.

A  12:48  p.m.  conversation  between  McKinley  and  other
speakers,  one  of  whom  McKinley  identified  as  Ford,  was
played for the jury while McKinley was on the stand, and a
transcript of the conversation (which Sergeant Farley testified
to  being  accurate,  (Docket  No.  79  at  68–69)),  *376   was

presented to the jury. 11  According to McKinley's testimony,
the  conversation  began  with  his  calling  to  Ford  (“Forte,”
pronounced  “forty”)  as  he  was  walking  from  the  highway:
“Oh man you own the highway, you own the highway. Forte
I want ... you the big man down here, you worrying about
comm' on comm' on man.” Gov't Exh. N–28. Then, based on
McKinley's identification of the speakers, Docket No. 80 at
21–22, 33, Ford explained to McKinley that he had no drugs
on him because he was forced to hide nine ounces of cocaine:

“I don't got nothing,” Ford said.

“Where you going to be at ... you had coke here,” McKinley
said.

Ford replied, “No the cops ... listen I was driving and they
started following me, so I had to go and stash it”

McKinley responded, “How much, how much did you stash?”

“Nine ounces.” Ford continued, “I did ... I cooked it up.... I
was scared ... I mean it wasn't outside or nowhere or nothing.”
Gov't Exh. N–28; Docket No. 80 at 21–22, 33.

McKinley testified that this conversation occurred after Ford
had brought him the half-ounce of crack cocaine. Docket No.
80 at 23.

After  the  transaction  at  the  Midway  Diner  had  been
completed, McKinley returned to the alley where he had been
dropped off and got into the van with Sergeant Farley and a
task force detective. Docket No. 79 at 161. McKinley gave
agents what he testified to be crack cocaine. Docket No. 79
at 161. DEA Forensic Chemist Ken Fuentecilla later tested
and  weighed  the  substance  and,  at  trial,  testified  that  the
substance was 12.7 grams of cocaine base. Docket No. 79 at
125. On cross-examination, Mr. Fuentecilla could not identify
the  substance  as  “crack”  cocaine,  and  could  not  provide  a
definition  of  “crack”  cocaine:  “Cocaine  base  crack,  it's—I
guess the word crack is a street term. So ... none of my analysis
are [sic]—you know, scientifically, crack means nothing to
me  really.”  Docket  No.  79  at  132–33.  Mr.  Fuentecilla  was
also  *377   unable  to  offer  a  distinction  between  “freebase
cocaine” and “crack” cocaine:

Q. Cocaine base, freebase is not referred to on the street as

crack, correct?

A. I don't know street terms.

Docket  No.  79  at  133.  On  further  cross-examination,
after some pressing, Mr. Fuentecilla acknowledged that his
report  of  the  substance  did  not  indicate  the  presence  of
hydrochloride or bicarbonates. 12  Docket No. 79 at 137.

B.
Ford  makes  two  substantial-evidence  claims.  First,  Ford
argues that there is not substantial evidence showing that he—
rather than one of the other individuals from whom McKinley
arranged  to  purchase  drugs  on  November  10,  2005—
distributed cocaine base to McKinley that day. Alternatively,
Ford argues that there is insufficient evidence from which to
conclude that the substance that McKinley purchased that day
was “crack,” rather than another form of cocaine base. For the
reasons that follow, I find these arguments unpersuasive.

1.

[1]
  In  order  to  conclude  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt  that
Ford distributed cocaine base on November 10, a factfinder
must credit Kevin McKinley's testimony. McKinley testified
that, on November 10, outside the Midway restaurant, Ford
gave  him  a  half-ounce  of  cocaine  base  in  exchange  for
$400. However, despite the task force's extensive surveillance
of  McKinley's  activities  on  November  10,  there  are  no
recordings or contemporaneous documentation corroborating
McKinley's  testimony  that,  via  a  quick  handshake,  he  and
Ford  exchanged  drugs  for  money.  The  nearest  thing  to
corroboration  is  Corporal  McEvoy's  testimony  that,  from
across a “very busy intersection,” he saw a handshake; but he
did not see a transfer or drugs and money.

Aside  from  McKinley's  testimony  that  he  purchased  crack
cocaine from Ford on November 10, the evidence that gives
strongest  support  for  the  jury's  verdict  is  the  11:55  a.m.
telephone conversation that day between McKinley and Ford.
Viewed in the light most favorable to the government, this
call shows that Ford agreed to sell cocaine base to McKinley,
and  let  McKinley  know  that  he  was  at  the  Midway  Diner.
However,  Ford  and  McKinley  did  not  discuss  when  the
transaction would actually occur and, minutes before this call
was placed, McKinley called Joe Martinez, who specifically

U.S. v. Ford, 618 F.Supp.2d 368 (2009)

agreed to sell drugs to McKinley within forty minutes of the
call.  McKinley  arrived  at  the  Midway  diner  approximately
thirty minutes after this call to Martinez. Hence, if one were
to  disbelieve  McKinley's  testimony,  but  nonetheless  credit
the testimony of each of the other government witnesses, the
evidence  would  not  support  a  finding  beyond  a  reasonable
doubt that Ford, rather than Martinez or another individual,
distributed  cocaine  base  to  McKinley  outside  the  Midway
restaurant on November 10.

Moreover,  in  addition  to  McKinley's  call  to  Martinez,
other  evidence  casts  doubt  on  whether  McKinley  testified
accurately that Ford, rather than another person, distributed
drugs  to  him  outside  the  Midway  restaurant.  According  to
Sergeant  Farley's  contemporaneous  notes,  when  McKinley
arrived  at  the  restaurant,  he  went  inside,  where  he  was
completely  free  from  surveillance,  for  approximately  two
minutes.  *378   13   McKinley  then  met  Ford  outside  the
restaurant and, after a moment, Ford left. McKinley testified
that, when Ford first arrived at the restaurant, they discussed
the price and volume of the drug purchase. Sergeant Farley
testified, however, that all conversations between McKinley
and Ford should have been recorded, and that McKinley did
not  have  the  ability  to  turn  off  the  recording  instruments
that  were  concealed  on  him.  Likewise,  although  McKinley
testified  to  calling  Ford  while  waiting  for  him  to  return  to
the restaurant with the drugs, Sergeant Farley testified that
there  is  no  record  of  such  a  call  having  been  made.  There
is, however, a recorded conversation between McKinley and
a person whom McKinley did not identify at trial about the
price of a half-ounce of crack cocaine. This conversation—
which, according to McKinley, occurred while he was still
waiting for Ford to return with the drugs—took place at 12:46
p.m.

It is even more difficult to reconcile McKinley's testimony
with  what  was  next  recorded.  At  12:48  p.m.,  within  two
minutes of the drug negotiation between McKinley and the
unidentified person, McKinley called out to Ford, who was
walking from the highway (“Oh man you own the highway,
you own the highway”). In this conversation, Ford explained
to  McKinley  that  he  “don't  got  nothing,”  and  that  he  was
forced  to  “stash”  nine  ounces  of  cocaine  because  he  was
being followed by police. While McKinley testified that the
12:46  pm  drug  negotiation  occurred  before  he  met  Ford,
he also testified that this 12:48 p.m. conversation—wherein

Ford  explains  that  he  did  not  have  any  drugs  with  him—
occurred after Ford dealt him a half-ounce of crack cocaine.
The government offered no explanation for this discrepancy.

[2]
  If,  in  light  of  this  evidence,  one  were  to  discredit
McKinley's  testimony  that  Ford  distributed  the  drugs  that
McKinley  purchased  on  November  10,  the  weight  of  the
evidence  would  not  support  the  jury's  verdict  of  guilty
on  Count  1  of  the  indictment.  However,  despite  the  jury's
acquittal  of  Ford  on  Count  2,  presumably  manifesting  jury
rejection of McKinley's testimony with respect to the alleged
November 17 distribution, I am precluded from assessing the
credibility of McKinley's testimony that he purchased cocaine
base from Ford on November 10. See Miller, 527 F.3d at 60.

*379   The  jury's  apparent  non-crediting  of  McKinley's
testimony about events on November 17 does not destabilize
the  jury's  manifest  crediting  of  McKinley's  testimony
regarding  November  10.  The  Third  Circuit  has  cautioned
that, in the context of a sufficiency-of-the-evidence review,
“[a]  jury  is  free  to  believe  part  of  a  witness'  testimony
and disbelieve another part of it[.]” United States v. Boone,
279  F.3d  163,  189  (3d  Cir.2002)  (internal  quotation  marks
omitted). Therefore, I must credit McKinley's testimony as to
the November 10 charge as true and, concomitantly, conclude
that the weight of the evidence supports the jury's verdict. See
United States v. Frampton, 382 F.3d 213, 222 (2d Cir.2004)
(“[T]he testimony of a single, uncorroborated eyewitness is
generally  sufficient  to  support  a  conviction,  and  ...  such  a
principle has deep roots in our system of justice.”) (internal
citations and quotation marks omitted).

Accordingly, under the “particularly deferential standard of
review”  that  governs  sufficiency-of-the-evidence  analysis,
see United States v. Kellogg, 510 F.3d 188, 202 (3d Cir.2007)
(internal  quotation  marks  omitted),  I  conclude  that  there  is
substantial evidence supporting the jury's determination that
Ford distributed cocaine base on November 10.

2.

Ford  also  argues  that,  whether  or  not  there  is  substantial
evidence  showing  that  he  distributed  cocaine  base  on
November  10,  there  is  insufficient  evidence  from  which
to  conclude  that  he  distributed  “a  mixture  and  substance

containing  a  detectable  amount  of  cocaine  base  (‘crack’),”
in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(b), as charged
in  count  one  of  the  indictment.  “Crack,”  as  the  term  is
defined in the Sentencing Guidelines, “is the street name for a
form of cocaine base, usually prepared by processing cocaine
hydrochloride and sodium bicarbonate, and usually appearing
in  a  lumpy  rocklike  form.” 14   DEA  Forensic  Chemist
Ken  *380  Fuentecilla testified, on cross-examination, that
while his tests of the substance distributed to McKinley on
November  10  confirmed  that  it  was  cocaine  base,  the  tests
did not reveal the presence of bicarbonates. Moreover, while
Sergeant  Farley  and  McKinley  referred  to  the  substance  in
question as “crack,” they do not appear to have described the
properties of the substance at a level of detail necessary to
demonstrate that they were referring to the form of cocaine
base  generally  accepted  to  be  “crack”  cocaine.  Therefore,
Ford argues, there is insufficient evidence that he distributed
“cocaine  base  (‘crack’),”  as  charged  in  count  one  of  the
indictment.

[3]
 Ford's arguments are misplaced. The question whether
Ford  distributed  “crack,”  as  opposed  to  another  form  of
cocaine  base,  has  no  bearing  on  whether  he  may  be  found
liable for violating 21 U.S.C. § 841. There is disagreement
among the circuit courts as to whether any substance other
than  “crack”  fits  within  the  definition  §  841  definition
of  “cocaine  base.”  The  Third  Circuit,  however,  “hold[s]
that, while the term ‘cocaine base’ means only crack when
a  sentence  is  imposed  under  the  Sentencing  Guidelines,
‘cocaine base’ encompasses all forms of cocaine base with
the  same  chemical  formula  when  the  mandatory  minimum
sentences  under  21  U.S.C.  §  841(b)(1)  are  implicated.”
United States v. Barbosa, 271 F.3d 438, 467 (3d Cir.2001).
Here,  the  government  has  established  that  the  substance
distributed to McKinley on November 10 was cocaine base.
Therefore,  whether  or  not  the  cocaine  base  distributed  on
November  10  was  “crack,”  there  was  evidence  submitted
to  the  jury  that  was  consistent  with  the  charge  that  Ford
distributed cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)
and (b)(1).

base distributed could be thought to constitute a substantial
variance between the indictment and the evidence adduced
at trial. See United States v. McKee, 506 F.3d 225, 231 n. 7
(3d Cir.2007) (“ ‘[A]mendments [to an indictment] ... occur
when  the  charging  terms  of  the  indictment  are  altered....’
Variances  occur  when  the  charging  terms  are  unchanged,
‘but  the  evidence  at  trial  proves  facts  materially  different
from those alleged in the indictment.’ If a variance between
the indictment and the evidence ‘does not alter the elements
of  the  offense  charged,  we  will  focus  upon  whether  or  not
there has been prejudice to the defendant.’ ”) (quoting  *381
United States v. Castro, 776 F.2d 1118, 1121–22 & n. 1 (3d
Cir.1985)). Ford does not allege such a material variance, and
I find none.

C.
In  summary,  I  conclude  that  the  government's  evidence,  if
credited, would allow a reasonable juror to conclude, beyond
a reasonable doubt, that Ford distributed five grams or more
of cocaine base on November 10. Therefore, a judgment of
acquittal will not be entered.

III. Prosecutorial Misconduct
[4]
 Having concluded that Ford is not entitled to a judgment
of acquittal, I turn to whether the verdict must be set aside
due to prosecutorial misconduct. Because Ford raised his
misconduct  claims  post-trial,  they  are  governed  by  Federal
Rule of Criminal Procedure 33, under which the district court
has  the  discretion  to  vacate  a  judgment  of  conviction  “if
the interest of justice so requires.” This “interest of justice”
determination  requires  me  to  consider  the  propriety  of  the
government's conduct and its effect on the verdict based on
an independent assessment of the evidence. See United States
v.  Johnson,  302  F.3d  139,  150  (3d  Cir.2002)  (“Unlike  an
insufficiency  of  the  evidence  claim,  when  a  district  court
evaluates  a  Rule  33  motion  it  does  not  view  the  evidence
favorably to the Government, but instead exercises its own
judgment in assessing the Government's case.”).

The fact that the grand jury alleged distribution of “cocaine
base (‘crack’),” and that the government did not establish that
the substance distributed was “crack,” as distinct from some
other form of cocaine base, would have the potential to affect
the verdict only if the imprecision as to the form of cocaine

A.
[5]
  Ford  argues  that  the  prosecutor  engaged  in  a  pattern
of misconduct that included vouching for the credibility of
the  government's  witnesses  and  lodging  unfounded  attacks
on Ford's counsel-a pattern which, Ford argues, began during

opening statements and culminated in the prosecutor's closing
argument  and,  in  particular,  the  closing-argument  rebuttal.
Analysis  of  these  claims  involves  a  two-stage  inquiry.
First, did the prosecutor's statements, considered in context,
constitute misconduct? Second, if misconduct occurred, was
it so severe that it may have had an adverse influence on the
jury's objectivity in arriving at a verdict? See United States v.
Young, 470 U.S. 1, 11, 105 S.Ct. 1038, 84 L.Ed.2d 1 (1985)
(“[A] criminal conviction is not to be lightly overturned on
the  basis  of  a  prosecutor's  comments  standing  alone,  for
the  statements  or  conduct  must  be  viewed  in  context;  only
by  doing  so  can  it  be  determined  whether  the  prosecutor's
conduct affected the fairness of the trial.”). Ford preserved
his misconduct claims through contemporaneous objections
at trial, including repeated requests for a mistrial, and I will
therefore review the claims in accordance with the harmless
error  principles  set  forth  in  United  States  v.  Zehrbach,  47
F.3d  1252,  1265  (3d  Cir.1995)  (en  banc)  (holding  that
prosecutorial misconduct amounting to non-constitutional
error “is harmless when it is highly probable that the error
did not contribute to the judgment”) (emphasis in original).
See  also  United  States  v.  Vitillo,  490  F.3d  314,  327  (3d
Cir.2007)  (reviewing  vouching  claims  for  harmless  error
when defendant “objected to the alleged vouching at trial and
by post-trial motion”).

B.
While Ford alleges that the prosecutor engaged in misconduct
throughout  the  course  of  the  trial,  the  focal  point  of
my  analysis  will  be  the  prosecutor's  remarks  during  the
government's closing-argument rebuttal. Ford's claim based
on  these  remarks  must  be  understood  in  the  context  of  a
trial  marred  by  considerable  tension  and,  at  times,  open
hostility,  between  the  prosecutor  and  the  defense  counsel.
Therefore,  before  addressing  Ford's  misconduct  claims,  I
will recapitulate portions  *382  of the record that place the
prosecutor's remarks in appropriate light.

1.

Two loci of tension between the parties were the testimony
of  Kevin  McKinley  and  Corporal  McEvoy.  McKinley,  the
government's cooperator, had a lengthy criminal history that
included  a  conviction  for  crack-cocaine  distribution, 15   a

charge for making terroristic threats in 2002, and, based on
his  having  shot  into  the  window  of  an  occupied  vehicle,
convictions in 2003 for reckless endangerment and carrying
an  illegal  firearm.  Docket  No.  80  at  62.  Seeking  to  make
McKinley's  background  more  palatable  to  the  jury,  the
prosecutor, in his opening argument, stressed that McKinley
was  to  be  respected  for  testifying  at  “the  risk  of  persons
who would have him not testify who would intimidate him.”
Docket  No.  79  at  25.  I  cautioned  the  prosecutor  that  this
characterization was “a little much.” 16  Then, in her opening
argument,  Ford's  counsel  addressed  McKinley's  lengthy
criminal  history,  which  she  characterized  as  a  “lifetime  of
crime,” including “[r]obberies, stabbings, drugs, drugs, drugs,
and more drugs,” and “carrying a gun, sticking up people, and
terrorizing people with that gun.” Docket No. 79 at 29, 31–
32.  This  characterization  prompted  the  prosecutor  not  only
to object, but also to accuse Ford's counsel, in open court, of
“making something up.” 17  Docket No. 79 at 32.

*383   Pursuant  to  both  parties'  objections,  at  sidebar  I
admonished  both  parties  for  their  comments,  stating  that
“Mr.  McGettigan  [the  prosecutor]  doesn't  need  to  say  that,
and  I  don't  think  we  need  to  talk  about  terrifying  ...  the
population.” 18  Docket No. 79 at 32.

Later,  during  his  direct  examination  of  McKinley,  the
prosecutor posed the following question to McKinley:

Q. Okay, and I noticed you have difficulty walking up here.

What's your present physical condition.

A. I was shot.

Docket  No.  79  at  142.  This  inquiry  drew  a  vigorous
objection from Ford's counsel, who, at sidebar, argued that the
prosecutor was trying to intimate that McKinley was shot “in
retaliation for testifying here and [that] he's afraid of people.”
Docket  No.  79  at  143.  The  prosecutor  represented  that  he
was simply trying to explain the cause of McKinley's obvious
injury, and that he had “no intention of trying in any respect to
impute [the shooting] to this defendant,” or, at my prompting,
to “anybody.” Docket No. 79 at 143. I cut off the prosecutor's
inquiry and issued the following instruction:

THE COURT: I think that the jury can
disregard  the  nature  of  the  witness's

injury. It doesn't figure into this case.
He—we'll trust he recovers quickly.

Docket No. 79 at 144.

the  prosecutor's  questions  as 

As McKinley's direct examination continued, the prosecutor
twice,  in  front  of  the  jury,  accused  Ford's  counsel  of
inappropriate  conduct.  First,  during  McKinley's  direct
examination, Ford's counsel successfully objected to several
of 
leading.  After  one
of  these  successful  objections,  the  prosecutor  openly
complained that Ford's counsel “doesn't understand what['s]
leading.” 19   *384   Docket  No.  79  at  164.  Second,  during
McKinley's cross-examination, the prosecutor objected when
Ford's counsel inaccurately summarized part of McKinley's
testimony.  In  doing  so,  the  prosecutor  accused  Ford's
counsel,  in  front  of  the  jury,  of  “intentionally  misstating
the  testimony.”  Docket  No.  80  at  31.  I  instructed  the
prosecutor that such “editorializing” during the objections “is
unnecessary.” 20  Docket No. 80 at 32.

The  defense's  examination  of  Corporal  McEvoy  prompted
another  heated  exchange  between  the  prosecutor  and
Ford's counsel. Corroborating McKinley's testimony that he
exchanged drugs and money with Ford through a handshake,
Corporal  McEvoy  testified  on  direct  examination  that  he
saw  Ford  and  McKinley  shake  hands  outside  the  Midway
Diner on November 10. On cross-examination, Ford's counsel
called  the  truthfulness  of  this  testimony  into  question  by
highlighting that Corporal McEvoy's contemporaneous notes
did  not  document  this  handshake  or  other  observations  to
which  he  testified.  Docket  No.  80  at  124.  On  re-direct
examination, the prosecutor asked McEvoy whether he would
“testify  to  anything  falsely  or  that  [he]  did  not  recollect  ...
to convict Harold Ford or anybody else,” to which Corporal
McEvoy  responded:  “Absolutely  not.”  Docket  No.  80  at
133.  Ford's  counsel  conducted  re-cross  examination  about
this statement, and elicited testimony that Corporal McEvoy
failed to inform the government that he was named, with other
officers, as a defendant in a lawsuit alleging arrests based on
an unlawful search: 21

*385   BY  MS.  LEFEBER:  Q.  When—in  preparation
for  your  testimony  here  today,  did  you  meet  with  Mr.
McGettigan?

[CPL. MCEVOY:] A. Yes, ma'am.

Q.  And,  did  he  ask  you  whether  or  not  there  are  any
pending actions against you for false arrests?

A. Yes, ma'am.

Q. And, did you tell him absolutely not?

A. Yes, ma'am.

Q. And, that isn't true, is it, sir?

A. No, ma'am.

Q. There is a pending law suit in this district court house
against you for participating in fabricating false arrests,
correct?

A. Ma'am, I believe your facts are far from true.

Q. Well, let's put it this way. There is a pending action
against  you  in  your  capacity  as  a  Coatesville  Police
Officer in this United States District Courthouse, is that
correct?

A. As a member of the Chester County Municipal Drug
Task Force, I was one of numerous officers named in a
law suit stemming from a search warrant ... which had
nothing to do with my testimony, ... false or true.

Docket No. 80 at 133–34. In further re-direct examination,
the  prosecutor  attempted  to  diminish  the  significance  of
Corporal McEvoy's omission in the following exchange:

BY MR. MCGETTIGAN: Q. Did I ever ask you if you
were involved in a law suit?

[CPL. MCEVOY:] A. Yes, sir.

Q. Did you tell me?

A. I told you that I didn't—I wasn't aware of anything
that was pending against me.

Q. Does this suit have anything to do—

MS.  LEFEBER:  Objection,  Your  Honor.  There's
nothing about what this law suit—

THE  COURT:  Mr.  McGettigan,  that  wasn't  a  useful
remark.

MR. MCGETTIGAN: I get [sic] your pardon.

Docket No. 80 at 135–36. Tension between counsel was
quite  high  at  this  point,  as  evidenced  by  the  prosecutor
accusing  Ford's  counsel,  at  sidebar,  of  “lying”  in  *386
claiming  that  Corporal  McEvoy  was  alleged  to  have
“participated in the writing of false affidavits in support of
the arrests.” 22  Docket No. 80 at 136–37.

2.

The  parties'  closing  arguments  were  no  less  heated.  The
prosecutor  was  the  first  to  summarize  his  case,  and  he
began  by  recounting  a  fictional  dialogue  with  an  unnamed
“colleague”  in  the  prosecutor's  office.  In  that  fictional
dialogue,  the  prosecutor  would  express  his  concerns  about
perceived  weaknesses  in  the  government's  case,  and  the
colleague would undertake to reassure the prosecutor. 23

Then,  after  addressing  the  credibility  of  the  government's
witnesses,  the  prosecutor  recited  what  he  characterized
“principles  that  apply  to  criminal  cases  generally.”  Docket
No. 81 at 15. The prosecutor asserted that, under these general

“principles,”  *387  the defense's argument that Ford was not
the person who distributed drugs to McKinley on November
10 was a “defense of ... last resort.” 24  Docket No. 81 at 16.
In  her  closing  argument,  Ford's  counsel  challenged  the
prosecutor's  characterization  of  Ford's  defense  as  one  of
“last  resort.”  Docket  No.  81  at  30–31.  Ford's  counsel  then
suggested that the government was trying to “keep the truth
from” the jury by having refused, in the course of the trial,
to  stipulate  to  the  fact  that  no  drugs  were  found  on  Ford
during  his  arrest, 25   and  by  objecting  to  Ford's  request  to
play  the  tape  of  McKinley  negotiating  a  drug  transaction
outside  the  Midway  Diner  during  the  period  when  he  was,
according to his testimony, waiting for Ford to return with the
drugs. 26   *388  Docket No. 81 at 31–24. Elaborating on this
point, Ford's counsel emphasized that the task force officers'
contemporaneous notes did not corroborate McKinley's and
McEvoy's testimony, and that other supporting evidence, such
as telephone records corroborating McKinley's claim that he
called Ford on November 10, “just isn't here:”

They  didn't  arrest  him  for  a  year  later,  is  the  excuse.  I
suggest to you, ladies and gentlemen, they didn't arrest him
for a year later, because they didn't believe their own case.
Docket No. 81 at 37.

Ford's counsel also aggressively questioned the truthfulness
of both McKinley's and Corporal McEvoy's testimony. Ford's
counsel characterized Corporal McEvoy as having “made a
deal  with  the  devil”  in  choosing  to  work  with  McKinley,
Docket  No.  81  at  34,  and  described  McKinley's  as  “a  man
that his entire adult life has engaged in drug dealing, carrying
loaded  weapons  to  enforce—to  get  whatever  he  wanted  to
get. Recklessly endangering other people with guns. Shooting
at  people,  stalking  them,  harassing  them,  assaulting  them.
Doing  whatever  he  could  to  get  his  way.”  Docket  No.  81
at 47–48. McKinley testified against Ford, defense counsel
argued, because “he realized that the jig [was] up” when he
was arrested in October 2005. Docket No. 81 at 48. Ford's
counsel  further  argued  that  “what  the  Government  proved
here  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt,  is  that  Kevin  McKinley
should  be  sitting  over  there  charged  with  the  crimes  that
he committed, and he should be the one facing 30 years to
life.”  Docket  No.  81  at  49–50.  Then,  Ford's  counsel  urged
the jury to ask whether Corporal McEvoy “appear[ed] to ...
have  his  own  agenda  in  this  case,”  Docket  No.  81  at  50,
and pointed to aspects of Corporal McEvoy's testimony that,

she argued, could support this conclusion. 27  After doing so,
Ford's counsel highlighted the  *389  prosecutor's question to
Corporal McEvoy, on redirect examination, as to whether he
would ever lie on the witness stand to convict Harold Ford:

from you, well, as a lawyer, you don't
have a whole lot, sometimes, but your
good  name  and  when  you're  accused
personally—.

And it was I who had to remind him, oh, no you wouldn't?
You lied to Mr. McGettigan when he asked you whether
there were any pending cases against you in your capacity
as a police officer in Coatesville, for making false affidavits
against people to get them arrested. You lied to your own
lawyer when he asked you that.

And, of course, it's your recollection that counts. But I
recall him saying, yeah. I didn't tell him about that. And
this is not about that lawsuit, whether or not he lied to
get other people arrested.

It's not about that. It's about his character for truthfulness
and  whether  or  not  he  would  lie  to  get  Harold  Ford
convicted.  And  I  submit  to  you,  if  he  lied  to  his  own
lawyer, Mr. McGettigan, about a prior lawsuit that we
learned are—is actually pending in this courthouse, if he
lied to his own—the lawyer for the Government about
that, he's lying to convict Harold Ford.”

Docket No. 81 at 53–54.

Against this background, the prosecutor began his rebuttal,
which were the final remarks that the jury heard from either
party, as follows:

Thank  you  your  Honor.  Ladies  and
gentlemen,  when  counsel  referred  to
the Government and the Government's
lawyer,  she  was  pointing  at  me.  She
should have been talking about Officer
—Corporal  McEvoy  back  there,  too.
Now, I'm the Government lawyer. I'm
not getting rich. If a trial goes a week,
I got to wear the same suit twice.

Docket No. 81 at 57. The prosecutor continued:

Docket  No.  81  at  57–58.  Ford's  counsel  objected  to  this
comment.

Calling  the  parties  to  sidebar,  I  instructed  the  parties  as
follows:

THE  COURT:  Ms.  Lefeber,  your
argument  is  one  that  challenges  the
Government's  readiness  to  present
the  truth,  and  so  Mr.  McGettigan
is  entitled  to  respond.  The  response,
I  think,  should  not  be  extensively
personal, Mr. McGettigan.... [I]t's not
a  personal  statement.  It's  a  statement
about  the  *390   Government  and
what the Government's responses and
attitudes  and  responsibilities  are.  So,
let's, from now on, have no more.

Docket No. 81 at 58.

The prosecutor's argument continued. After suggesting that
the  jury  should  reject  the  “argument  that  the  Government
didn't  want  you  to  know  the  truth,”  the  prosecutor,
approaching the jury box, said:

You know, phone records, that would
have  been  a  good  idea.  It  wasn't  my
idea. But to say that the Government's
counsel,  the  Government  sought  to
conceal  the  truth  from  you,  I  submit
goes  beyond 
the  pale.  As  does
accusing an honorable, I would submit
—

Docket No. 81 at 59.

By  this  point,  the  prosecutor  was  fully  facing  the  jury  box
and speaking at a volume too quiet to be heard by me or by
the court reporter, and the transcript reflects this gap. At my
request, the prosecutor continued at a louder volume:

But  when

Government  wants  to  keep  the  truth

U.S. v. Ford, 618 F.Supp.2d 368 (2009)

You saw Officer McEvoy on the witness stand, Corporal
McEvoy. And I'm sure you saw much of his—much of his
head that's visible get a little bit red as he was accused of
things. Probably did, again.

And you saw him ... accused here. As if he were being paid
piecework. And I'd submit to you that he was an honorable
police officer doing honorable work. And, instead, for his
trouble, you saw him accused of being a liar, as if he would
lie to convict Harold Ford. As if the Government's counsel
would mislead you to convict Harold Ford.

Docket No. 81 at 59–60. Ford's counsel again objected, and I
cautioned the prosecutor that “we're not going to be pursuing
personal lines.” Docket No. 81 at 60. The prosecutor then,
after explaining that “you're going to get called names” in his
line of profession, offered the following anecdote:

I'm reminded by counsel's argument of
something that occurred to me, not that
long ago. I ran into a defense attorney
who I knew and was friends with, from
years  gone  by,  and  he  was  about  to
close to a jury early in the day. I said,
hey,  Brian,  can  I  buy  you  lunch?  He
said,  don't  wait,  it  might  take  me  a
while to confuse the issue. And that's
why  I  said  what  I  had  to  say  before
counsel got up.

Docket No. 81 at 60.

Then, after addressing the credibility of Kevin's McKinley's
testimony,  the  prosecutor  commented  on  the  defendant's
failure to testify at trial:

In  addition,  counsel,  at  one  point,  I
think she said and I made a few notes
here, that the defendant said, well, Mr.
Ford doesn't have to say anything, and
he didn't say anything. He hasn't said
a  word  in  this  courtroom.  So  I  don't
know what she was referring to.

Docket No. 81 at 62.

The prosecutor went on to address Ford's counsel's suggestion
that the government did not believe its own case and, in doing

so, characterized the defendant's closing argument as “a lot
of  lawyer  noises  being  made  there.” 28   Docket  No.  81  at
64.  *391  Then, responding to the defense's characterization
of  McKinley's  criminal  history,  the  prosecutor  revisited
McKinley's  statement  that  he  had  been  shot,  which  I  had
previously instructed the jury to ignore:

Counsel, I believe said, at least once or more than once,
that Kevin shot somebody, he was shooting somebody to
get whatever he wanted. As I recall, he got shot, not that
he shot someone.
Docket  No.  81  at  65.  Ford's  counsel  objected  to  this
statement, which I overruled by saying “I think the jury will
remember and decide what was said. It's up to the jury.”
Docket No. 81 at 65.

The prosecutor then continued his closing argument with this
remark:

At  this  moment,  I'm  reminded  of  a
discussion I had outside of a courtroom
one  time,  where  I  was  trying  to
persuade  a  number  of  people,  and
I  was  interrupted  by  my  opponent,
my  adversary  in  the  argument.  And
eventually,  after  his  second  or  third
time, he said, hey, shut up, Joe you're
making sense.

Docket  No.  81  at  65–66.  I  then  issued  another  cautionary
instruction, and the rest of the prosecutor's rebuttal continued
without interruption.

  [7]

 Ford contends that, in his rebuttal, the prosecutor

C.
[6]
committed misconduct by vouching for the credibility of the
government witnesses and disparaging Ford's counsel. As the
Supreme Court has observed in United States v. Young:

against  the  defendant  and  can  thus
jeopardize  the  defendant's  right  to
be  tried  solely  on  the  basis  of  the
evidence  presented  to  the  jury;  and
the  prosecutor's  opinion  carries  with
it  the  imprimatur  of  the  Government
and  may  induce  the  jury  to  trust  the
Government's judgment rather than its
own view of the evidence.

470 U.S. at 18–19, 105 S.Ct. 1038. According to the Third
Circuit,  in  order  to  establish  that  a  prosecutor's  remarks
constitute  improper  vouching,  “two  criteria  must  be  met:
(1)  the  prosecutor  must  assure  the  jury  that  the  testimony
of a Government witness is credible; and (2) this assurance
is  based  on  either  the  prosecutor's  personal  knowledge,  or
other information not contained in the record.' ” Kindler v.
Horn, 542 F.3d 70, 87 (3d Cir.2008) (quoting United States
v. Walker, 155 F.3d 180, 187 (3d Cir.1998)). “The defendant
must  be  able  to  identify  as  the  basis  for  [the  prosecutor's
comment on witness credibility] explicit or implicit reference
to either the personal knowledge of the prosecuting attorney
or  information  not  contained  in  the  record.”  United  States
v. Brennan, 326 F.3d 176, 183 (3d Cir.2003) (alterations in
original) (quoting Walker, 155 F.3d at 187).

Linked  to  these  vouching  claims  is  Ford's  contention  that
the  prosecutor  impugned  the  truthfulness  of  Ford's  counsel
based on information outside the record. See United States v.
Rivas, 493 F.3d 131, 139 (3d Cir.2007) (“[T]he prohibition
against personal attacks on attorneys is rooted less in a sense
of decorum than in the same rule underlying the prohibition
*392  on vouching: one cannot make arguments unsupported
by  the  record  evidence.”).  The  statements  that  ground  this
misconduct  claim  are  interwoven  with  the  remarks  that,
according  to  Ford,  constituted  personal  assurances  by  the
prosecutor as to the credibility of the government's witnesses.
Therefore, in order to avoid drawing an artificial distinction
between  the  contexts  in  which  the  remarks  arose,  I  will
analyze Ford's misconduct claims based on the prosecutor's
disparagement of counsel together with his vouching claims.
See, e.g., Young, 470 U.S. at 11, 105 S.Ct. 1038 (“[A] criminal
conviction is not to be lightly overturned on the basis of a
prosecutor's comments standing alone, for the statements or
conduct must be viewed in context; only by doing so can it
be determined whether the prosecutor's conduct affected the
fairness of the trial.”).

1.

The  prosecutor's  rebuttal  was  focused  on  bolstering  the
credibility of McKinley's and Corporal McEvoy's testimony.
This  focus  was  appropriate,  as  Ford's  counsel  called  the
truthfulness  of  those  witnesses'  testimony  into  question.
However,  in  expressing  his  anger  that  Ford's  counsel
challenged  the  integrity  of  the  government's  case,  the
prosecutor remarks went beyond appealing to the evidence
in  the  record  and  invoked  the  prestige  of  the  government's
office.

[8]
  First,  the  prosecutor  accused  Ford's  counsel  of  going
“beyond  the  pale”  in  suggesting  that  the  government  was
concealing  the  truth  from  the  jury  by  failing  to  provide
telephone  records  corroborating  McKinley's  testimony  and
by “accusing an honorable” officer of testifying untruthfully.
Continuing with this argument, the prosecutor undertook to
assure  the  jury  that  Corporal  McEvoy  was  an  “honorable
police  officer”  and  equated  the  integrity  of  the  challenged
law-enforcement-officer  witness  with 
integrity  of
“Government counsel”—i.e., the prosecutor himself:

the 

I'd  submit  to  you  that  [McEvoy]
was an honorable police officer doing
honorable work. And, instead, for his
trouble, you saw him accused of being
a  liar,  as  if  he  would  lie  to  convict
Harold  Ford.  As  if  the  Government's
counsel would mislead you to convict
Harold Ford.

Docket No. 81 at 60.

[9]
  The  government  contends  that  the  prosecutor  did  not,
at  any  point  during  the  course  in  these  remarks,  offer
a  personal  opinion  as  to  the  credibility  of  the  witnesses.
However, a prosecutor's assurance of a witness's credibility is
impermissible if it is based on either an “explicit or implicit
reference  to  ...  the  personal  knowledge  of  the  prosecuting
attorney.” See Brennan, 326 F.3d at 183. The Third Circuit
has held that prosecutorial remarks that may be construed as
invoking the integrity of the government may be appropriate
if, when the remarks are considered in context, it is clear that
the prosecutor was making a specific argument, based on the

U.S. v. Ford, 618 F.Supp.2d 368 (2009)

trial  record,  about  the  government's  veracity.  For  example,
in Brennan, the court considered a closing argument that the
prosecutor  initiated  by  saying  that  “  ‘one  hallmark  of  our
system is that we don't make accusations without proof.’ ” Id.
at 185. The court acknowledged that, read in isolation, this
remark “could be read to suggest that evidence outside the
record demonstrated [the defendant's] guilt.” Id. However, the
court observed that “immediately following his assertion that
the  Government  does  not  make  accusations  without  proof,
the prosecutor directed the jury to consider the corroborating
evidence  and  [a  witness's]  demeanor  during  his  five  days
of  testimony.”  Id.  at  186.  Therefore,  the  Brennan  court
determined, the statement at issue,  *393  taken in context,
was a legitimate attack on the defendant's case. Similarly, in
United States v. Walker, 155 F.3d 180 (3d Cir.1998), the court
held that it was permissible to ask the jury what motivation a
testifying officer had to lie in order to draw attention to the
lack of evidence supporting the defendant's challenge to the
officer's truthfulness. Id. at 186.

In this case, by contrast, several of the prosecutor's objected-
to remarks during rebuttal—particularly his statement that it
was  “beyond  the  pale”  for  Ford's  counsel  to  challenge  the
truthfulness of the government's case” and his expression of
offense  (“[a]s  if  the  Government's  counsel  would  mislead
you  to  convict  Harold  Ford”)—were  not  tethered  to  the
record.  When  viewed  in  context—a  context  that  includes
other, milder forms of vouching 29  as well as the prosecutor's
attacks  on  Ford's  counsel  and  his  characterization  of  the
defense's  closing  argument  as  an  insult  to  his  “good
name” 30 —the  prosecutor's  remarks  were,  quite  plainly,
decoupled from the record. Nor is there reason to regard the
remarks  as  simply  being  regrettable  but  excusably  inartful
turns of phrase. They were remarks with the clear potential
of artificially magnifying the government's credibility in the
eyes of the jury, whether or not they were so intended. Thus,
with these statements, the prosecutor went beyond asking the
jury what motivation Corporal McEvoy had to lie, or what
motivation  the  government  had  to  withhold  the  truth,  and
managed to invoke the government's prestige in bolstering its
witnesses' credibility. 31

[10]
 The prosecutor's remarks, taken in context, thus closely
resemble those that the court found improper in United States
v. Dispoz–O–Plastics, Inc., 172 F.3d 275, 283 (3d Cir.1999),
where the prosecutor bolstered the credibility of a cooperating

witness by assuring the jury that the government  *394  does
not “give two for one deals.” They also evoke the remarks
that the court found impermissible in United States v. Molina–
Guevara,  96  F.3d  698,  704–05  (3d  Cir.1996),  where  the
prosecutor told the jury “that it was ‘insulting’ and ‘ridiculous'
to think that the United States would put on a witness who
would  lie.”  See  also  United  States  v.  DiLoreto,  888  F.2d
996, 998–99 (3d Cir.1989) (holding that vouching occurred
where  the  prosecutor  asserted  that  “[w]e  [the  government]
don't take liars. We don't put liars on the stand. We don't do
that”), overruled on other grounds by Zehrbach, 47 F.3d 1252
(holding that prosecutorial misconduct is not reversible per
se and must be reviewed for harmless error). Here, as in those
cases, the prosecutor did not defend the witnesses' credibility
based on inferences that could be drawn from the evidence.
Instead,  the  prosecutor  relied  on  the  prestige  of  his  office
to  counter  the  suspicions  that  Ford's  counsel  attempted  to
convey to the jury through arguments that, while aggressive,
were grounded in the record. 32  This is misconduct.

2.

[11]
  Also  problematic  were  the  prosecutor's  remarks
disparaging not just Ford's counsel, but the criminal defense
bar  more  generally.  In  response  to  objections  by  Ford's
counsel  to  the  prosecutor's  rebuttal,  the  prosecutor  offered
the two anecdotes described above, relating tales about how
defense  attorneys  generally  try  to  “confuse  the  issue[s]”
and prevent government attorneys from “making sense.” See
supra section IIB3 (explaining the content of the prosecutor's
rebuttal).

These  comments  were  manifestly 
inappropriate.  The
anecdotes served no purpose other than to encourage a juror
to  reject  the  defendant's  arguments  based  on  its  skepticism
of  the  criminal  defense  system,  rather  than  on  the  strength
of  the  government's  evidence.  They  bore  no  relationship
to  the  evidence  at  bar,  and  they  were  incompatible  with
the  constraints  *395   that  guide  a  prosecutor.  See  ABA
Standards  for  Criminal  Justice  (3d  ed.  1993)  §§  3–5.8(c)
(  “The  prosecutor  should  not  make  arguments  calculated
to  appeal  to  the  prejudices  of  the  jury.”),  3–5.8(d)  (“The
prosecutor should refrain from argument which would divert
the jury from its duty to decide the case on the evidence.”).

Williams, Brooke 6/26/2015
For Educational Use Only

U.S. v. Ford, 618 F.Supp.2d 368 (2009)

The  government  argues  that  these  remarks  were  “direct
comments  on  defense  tactics,”  specifically  Ford's  counsel
having interrupted the prosecutor's rebuttal with objections,
and therefore “they were not improper.” Docket No. 89 at 28–
29. This is incorrect for three reasons:

First, Ford's counsel's objections to the prosecutor's rebuttal
were appropriate responses to the prosecutor's remarks and,
indeed, necessary to preserve Ford's misconduct claims for
review.

[12]
  Second,  while  the  prosecutor  may  be  permitted  to
comment  on  specific,  inappropriate  defense  arguments  for
the  purpose  of  tempering  any  clearly  unwarranted  juror
suspicions  of  the  government's  case  that  such  arguments
may  give  rise  to,  the  prosecutor  is  not  permitted  to  do
so  in  a  way  that  is  itself  calculated  to  inflame  the  jury's
prejudices.  See,  e.g.,  Dispoz–O–Plastics,  Inc.,  172  F.3d  at
284–85 (holding that the invited response doctrine may not be
used as a “springboard” to “launch[ ] affirmative attacks upon
defendants”).  Thus,  regardless  of  whether  the  prosecutor's
observations were uttered in response to what the prosecutor
perceived to be an inappropriate defense tactic, the prosecutor
engaged in misconduct.

Third, the prosecutor's anecdotes do not appear to have been
addressed to a specific defense tactic. The prosecutor cast his
insults in general terms, and did not comment upon specific
behavior  by  Ford's  counsel  that  he  deemed  inappropriate.
More tellingly, the prosecutor's inappropriate remarks were
not isolated responses to perceived defense challenges. Later
in  his  rebuttal,  the  prosecutor  characterized  the  defense's
closing  arguments  as  “a  lot  of  lawyer  noises  being  made
there.” Furthermore, the prosecutor's attacks during rebuttal
echoed  inappropriate  and  inflammatory  accusations  that  he
earlier  made  in  open  court,  such  as  the  charge,  made
during  Ford's  counsel's  opening  statement,  that  she  was
“making something up.” 33   *396  Those earlier accusations
antedated Ford's counsel's closing argument, which belies the
government's  argument  that  the  prosecutor's  attacks  during
rebuttal were a measured response to specific defense tactics.

I  therefore  find  that  the  prosecutor's  attacks  on  Ford's
counsel and the defense bar generally cannot be justified as
“comments made in reasonable response to improper attacks
by defense counsel.”

3.

[13]
  In  addition  to  making  personal  assurances  about
the  credibility  of  the  government's  witnesses  and  offering
inappropriate  remarks  about  Ford's  counsel,  the  prosecutor
attempted to bolster McKinley's credibility through evidence
outside the record. Early in McKinley's direct examination,
the  prosecutor  elicited  testimony  that  McKinley  had  been
shot, but assured the court that he had “no intention of trying
in  any  respect  to  impute”  McKinley's  shooting  to  Ford.  I
instructed the jury to disregard this testimony. Docket No. 79
at 143–44. Nevertheless, in his rebuttal, the prosecutor said:

Counsel,  I  believe  said,  at  least  once
or  more  than  once,  that  Kevin  shot
somebody, he was shooting somebody
to get whatever he wanted. As I recall,
he got shot, not that he shot someone.

Docket No. 81 at 65.

The government does not address this comment even though
Ford  objected  to  it  at  trial  and  raised  it  in  his  Rule  29
motion.  I  nonetheless  note  that  the  comment  not  only
refers  to  testimony  the  jury  was  specifically  instructed
to  disregard,  but  also  incorrectly  suggests  that  there  was
no  evidence  supporting  Ford's  counsel's  comment,  in  her
opening argument, that McKinley's criminal history included
“[s]hooting  at  people.”  Docket  No.  81  at  48.  In  fact,
McKinley testified that he pleaded guilty in 2003 to reckless
endangerment for shooting into the window of an occupied
vehicle, Docket No. 80 at 62–63.

Additionally, this comment by the prosecutor in his rebuttal
came  at  the  conclusion  of  a  trial  in  which  the  prosecutor
repeatedly  focused  the  jury's  attention  on  threats  that  were
allegedly  directed  toward  McKinley.  First,  in  his  opening
statement,  the  prosecutor  advised  the  jurors  that  McKinley
cooperated with the government “at some apprehension and
risk  to  himself,”  and  that  McKinley  was  testifying  “at  the
risk  of  persons  who  would  have  him  not  testify  and  who
would intimidate him.” Docket No. 79 at 24–25. Later, the
prosecutor  attempted  to  ask  Agent  Wood  “[w]hat  would
have happened to Kevin McKinley if Harold Ford had been
arres[ted]” in 2005. Docket No. 80 at 154–55.

U.S. v. Ford, 618 F.Supp.2d 368 (2009)

Unfortunately, I must conclude that the prosecutor's rebuttal
effectively  undermined  his  prior  assurance  that  he  had  “no
intention  of  trying  in  any  respect  to  impute  [the  shooting]
to this defendant.” I therefore conclude that the prosecutor's
reference  to  McKinley's  shooting  was  made  to  bolster
McKinley's  credibility  and  inflame  the  jury's  prejudices
against the defendant based on information not contained in
the record.

D.
Having  identified  instances  of  prosecutorial  misconduct-
improper  vouching,  inappropriate  disparaging  of  Ford's
counsel  and  the  defense  bar  generally,  and  prejudicially
referring to extra-record information  *397  —to which Ford
raised contemporaneous objections, I must consider whether
these claims constituted harmless error. 34  I will undertake
this review in accordance with the harmless error standard set
forth in Zehrbach:

The harmless error doctrine requires that the court consider
an error in light of the record as a whole, but the standard
of  review  in  determining  whether  an  error  is  harmless
depends  on  whether  the  error  was  constitutional  or  non-
constitutional. In this instance, the alleged error, attacking
the credibility of a witness with evidence not in the record,
is non-constitutional. We have held that non-constitutional
error is harmless when “it is highly probable that the error
did  not  contribute  to  the  judgment.”  “High  probability”
requires that the court possess a “sure conviction that the
error did not prejudice” the defendant.
47 F.3d at 1265 (citations omitted; emphasis in original).
I  will  treat  defendant's  charges  as  claims  of  non-
constitutional  error  for  the  purpose  of  this  review.
See,  e.g.,  United  States  v.  Weatherly,  525  F.3d  265,
273  (3d  Cir.2008)  (reviewing  vouching  claims  for  non-
constitutional  error);  but  see  Molina–Guevara,  96  F.3d
698, 705 (3d Cir.1996) (reviewing vouching that allegedly
violated  a  defendant's  Sixth  Amendment  rights  for
constitutional  error).  Therefore,  having  determined  that
misconduct has occurred, I must consider whether I am left
with a “sure conviction that the error did not prejudice the
defendant.” Zehrbach, 47 F.3d at 1265.

[14]
  “The  test  for  determining  prejudice,”  under  this
standard,  “is  tripartite.  The  factors  to  be  examined  are

the  scope  of  the  comments  and  their  relationship  to  the
proceeding, the extent of any curative instructions, and the
strength of the evidence against the defendants.” Dispoz–O–
Plastics, Inc., 172 F.3d at 286 (citing Zehrbach, 47 F.3d at
1265).

[15]
  First,  as  to  “the  scope  of  the  comments”  made  by
the prosecutor during rebuttal and “their relationship to the
proceeding,”  the  prosecutor  vouched  repeatedly,  including
when  he  characterized  Ford's  defense  strategy  as  one  of
“last resort,” Docket 81 at 15–16, and addressed the lawsuit
against  Corporal  McEvoy,  by  saying  that  his  fictional
“colleague said, well, weren't you, the defense attorney and
the  Judge  in  your  last  drug  case  all  sued?”  Docket  No.  81
at  12.  The  prosecutor's  attacks  on  Ford's  counsel  and  his
comments alluding to McKinley's shooting and to Corporal
McEvoy  were  plainly  intended  to  bolster  McKinley's  and
McEvoy's  testimony.  As  McKinley  was  the  government's
only  eyewitness  to  Ford's  distribution  of  cocaine  base  on
November  10,  and  the  record  contained  recordings  that
are  not  clearly  in  harmony  with  McKinley's  testimony,
any information that would bolster McKinley's credibility—
including McEvoy's testimony that he observed a handshake
between  Ford  and  McKinley—could  have  been  pivotal  in
persuading  a  jury  of  Ford's  guilt.  Cf.  Werts  v.  Vaughn,
228  F.3d  178,  200  (3d  Cir.2000)  (finding  that  prosecutor's
comments  were  harmless  where  they  were  not  based  on
information  *398   not  presented  to  the  jury  and  where
the  record  contained  “ample  evidence”  of  the  defendant's
guilt). Moreover, the comments at issue occurred during the
government's rebuttal, which was the final statement to the
jury by either attorney, and could therefore have carried undue
weight with the jury as they began their deliberations.

Second,  I  did  not  issue  any  specific,  curative  instructions
to  address  the  prosecutor's  remarks.  I  informally  conveyed
displeasure with some of the prosecutor's attacks on Ford's
counsel,  and  issued  a  general  instruction,  in  the  jury
charge,  that  “[w]hat  the  attorneys  have  said  ...  is  not
evidence.”  But  see  Dispoz–O–Plastics,  172  F.3d  at  287
(finding  that  a  general  instruction  to  evaluate  witnesses'
credibility  based  on  their  testimony  was  not  sufficient
to  neutralize  the  harm  caused  by  a  specific  instance  of
prosecutorial  vouching).  Moreover,  it  is  quite  possible  that
one of my instructions may inadvertently have exacerbated
the effect of the prosecutor's misconduct: after the prosecutor
reminded  the  jury  that  McKinley  “got  shot,”  I  allowed

the  prosecutor  to  continue  his  rebuttal  over  the  defendant's
objection  and  said  that  “I  think  the  jury  will  remember
and  decide  what  was  said.  It's  up  to  the  jury.”  Docket
No.  81  at  65.  Unfortunately,  a  juror  may  have  reasonably
construed  this  statement  as  permitting  the  jury  to  ignore
my  earlier  instruction  to  disregard  McKinley's  testimony
about  being  shot.  My  response  to  Ford's  objection  during
the  prosecutor's  rebuttal  may  therefore  have  aggravated
whatever  degree  of  prejudice  might  have  ensued  from  the
prosecutor's  statement  had  I  remained  silent.  See  United
States v. Mastrangelo, 172 F.3d 288, 295–98 (3d Cir.1999)
(reversing for prosecutorial misconduct where the district
court's faulty curative instruction exacerbated the prejudice
caused by a prosecutor's remark).

Third, I must evaluate the effect of the prosecutor's remarks
in  light  of  “the  strength  of  the  evidence  against  Ford.”  As
addressed  above,  the  government's  evidence  against  Ford
was  far  from  overwhelming,  and  a  reasonable  juror  could
have  concluded,  from  that  evidence,  that  Ford  was  not  the
individual from whom McKinley purchased cocaine base on
November 10, 2005. Unless a reasonable juror were to credit
McKinley's  testimony,  he  would  be  left  without  sufficient
evidence from which to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt
that Harold Ford, rather than one of the other individuals with
whom McKinley negotiated drug purchases on November 10,
sold cocaine base to McKinley that day.

Ultimately,  having  balanced  these  factors  in  considering
the  effect  of  prosecutor's  remarks  during  his  rebuttal,  I
cannot  say  that  I  am  left  with  a  “  ‘sure  conviction  that
the  error  did  not  prejudice’  the  defendant.”  Zehrbach,  47
F.3d at 1265. In a trial that was interlarded with gratuitous
attacks  by  both  parties,  it  would  hardly  be  surprising
that  the  prosecutor  was  tempted,  at  times,  to  engage  in
inappropriate  conduct.  Ford's  defense,  and  particularly  the
closing  argument  of  his  counsel,  challenged  the  integrity
of  both  the  prosecutor  and  the  government's  witnesses.
These challenges merited a vigorous response. Unfortunately,
however,  the  prosecutor  went  beyond  any  response  that
was  warranted.  The  prosecutor's  inappropriate  comments
bolstered  the  credibility  of  witnesses  whose  testimony,  in
light  of  the  weakness  of  the  government's  evidence,  was
necessary to secure Ford's conviction. Consequently, I must
conclude  that  there  is  not  a  high  probability  that  the
prosecutorial misconduct in this case did not contribute to
the jury's verdict.

IV. Conclusion
In  this  opinion  I  have  described  two  courtroom  aspects  of
this case that made  *399  for a difficult trial. The first was
the pervasive acrimony that colored the interactions between
the  lawyer  representing  the  United  States  and  the  lawyer
representing  Harold  Ford.  The  second—closely  related  to
the  first—was  the  prosecutor's  drumbeat  of  derision,  not
simply  for  opposing  counsel  but  for  those  lawyers,  as  a
class,  who  are  engaged  in  the  representation  of  criminal
defendants,  to  the  point  of  suggesting  that  such  lawyers
engage  in  deliberate  deception.  This  was,  in  my  view,  the
worst of the prosecutor's offenses. The recitals, in his closing-
argument-rebuttal,  of  statements  he  attributed  to  members
of  the  criminal  defense  bar  could  only  have  been  intended
to  convey  the  view  that  criminal  defense  attorneys  have
as  their  goals  “confus  [ing]  the  issue[s]”  and  preventing
the government from “making sense.” This belittling of the
criminal  defense  process  extended  also  to  the  prosecutor's
characterization  of  the  defense  of  misidentification  as  a
defense  “of  last  resort.” 35   By  anecdote  and  innuendo,
criminal  defense  lawyers  were  portrayed  for  the  jury  as
persons whose expected and habitual professional role is to
mislead  the  jury  by  distorting,  or  hiding,  the  truth  through
a criminal defense process that encourages such deception.
For  counsel  for  the  United  States  to  show  such  disrespect
and, indeed, disdain for crucial ingredients of constitutional
processes developed over centuries was inexcusable.

A reader of this transcript could well say that a prosecutor
behaving in this fashion should have been called to account,
early  and  often,  by  the  judge.  Such  criticism  would  be
appropriate.  In  reading  over  the  transcript  I  found  myself,
at  many  points,  troubled  that  I  had  not  stepped  in  and
directed the prosecutor to cease behaving in a fashion signally
inappropriate  for  a  government's  lawyer.  Too  often  I  was
too  mild  in  reproof  or  simply  directed  the  prosecutor  to
move  on.  One  could,  therefore,  argue  that  it  is  not  merely
unbecoming,  but  far  too  late  in  the  day,  for  the  judge  to
determine  that  the  prosecutor  committed  misconduct.  But
that begs the issue. The question is whether the prosecutor's
unhappy behavior may have caused substantial damage to the
integrity of the trial, thus prejudicing the defendant. With this
in mind, one recognizes that the judge's unduly tepid response
to the prosecutor's behavior was not likely to have done much

to insure that the defendant was accorded the fair process that
was his due.

Accordingly,  because  I  believe  that  there  is  a  significant
possibility that the fairness of the jury's verdict may have been

threatened by the prosecutorial vouching and attacks on the
defendant's counsel, I will exercise my discretion to set aside
the  jury's  verdict  on  count  one  of  the  indictment  and  grant
Ford a new trial.

In  moving  for  acquittal  due  to  prosecutorial  misconduct,  Ford  mistakes  his  remedy.  A  finding  of  prosecutorial
misconduct would call for setting aside the verdict with a view to retrial (Rule 33(a)), not entering a judgment of acquittal.
Specifically,  the  grand  jury  charged  that  (1)  “[o]n  or  about  November  10,  2005,”  Ford  “knowingly  and  intentionally
distributed approximately 5 grams or more ... of a mixture and substance containing a detectable amount of cocaine
base (‘crack’),” and (2) “[o]n or about November 17, 2005,” Ford “knowingly and intentionally distributed approximately 5
grams or more ... of a mixture and substance containing a detectable amount of cocaine base (‘crack’).” Docket No. 10.
McKinley testified that, in June 1997, he pled guilty to distributing crack cocaine “[o]n a number of occasions.” Docket
No. 80 (Transcript of Trial, January 25, 2008) at 60.
Sergeant Farley testified that, while he could hear McKinley's part of these telephone conversations, and the recordings
included each speaker in a telephone conversation, Sergeant Farley could not himself hear the party speaking at the
other end of the line. Docket No. 79 at 42.
The transcript that the government had originally drafted reported Speaker 2 as saying “I need that I need that A–Stem.”
Docket No. 78 (Transcript of Trial, January 23, 2008) at 32. Prior to trial, the government edited the transcript to read:
“I need that I need that H–Town.” McKinley testified at trial that “H–Town” is slang for half an ounce of crack cocaine,
Docket No. 80 at 24, and that a pipe used to smoke crack cocaine is referred to as “a stem.” Docket No. 80 at 35. At
a pretrial hearing, I directed the government to revise the transcript to be presented to the jury to include both possible
interpretations of the recording. Docket No. 78 at 49–50.
Sergeant  Farley's  testimony  was  based  on  his  contemporaneous  notes  of  what  was  being  reported  to  him  by  other
members  of  the  task  force.  Though  he  did  not  personally  observe  McKinley  during  the  transaction,  Sergeant  Farley
testified that, while the operation was taking place, he took approximately four pages of notes of what other members of
the task force were reporting to him. Docket No. 79 at 71–72. Sergeant Farley also testified that, after the transaction,
took place, he met with McKinley, dictated McKinley's account of the transaction, and had McKinley read and correct any
inaccuracies in the transcribed account. Docket No. 79 at 48–49.
This testimony is consistent with the signed statement that McKinley gave to Sergeant Farley, at approximately 1:30 pm
on the day in question: “We talked about the purchase of one-half ounce of crack. [Ford] then told me that he had to go
to Merchant Street to get the half ounce.” Docket No. 79 at 94–95.
Corporal McEvoy, who was conducting surveillance of McKinley, testified that he could not recall whether or not McKinley
went inside the Midway Diner at any time. Docket No. 80 at 125.
In her closing argument, Ford's counsel said that the alleged transaction between Ford and McKinley was “at least a block
and a half to two blocks from where [McEvoy] was situated.” Docket No. 81 (Transcript of Trial, January 28, 2008) at 52.
The government charges Ford's counsel with misstating Corporal McEvoy's testimony, and claims that Corporal McEvoy
testified that he was “less than four feet from the two men” when they shook hands and, according to the government,
engaged in the drug transaction. Docket No. 89 at 9 (citing Docket No. 80 at 102).

The  government's  characterization  of  Corporal  McEvoy's  testimony  is  incorrect.  Corporal  McEvoy  testified  that  he
began observing McKinley from a position “approximately two blocks east of th[e] bar” where McKinley met Ford, and
that he moved his vehicle so that he was eventually observing McKinley from “approximately a block and a half” from
the bar. Docket No. 80 at 98–100. Corporal McEvoy testified that he saw Ford meet McKinley in front of the bar and
then leave for a few minutes. Corporal McEvoy then testified that, when he again saw Ford and McKinley together in
front of the bar, they were approximately four feet or less from each other. Docket No. 80 at 102.

10

Corporal McEvoy testified that he took no notes of his observations on November 10 and, concomitantly, that he had no
contemporaneous record of witnessing a handshake between Ford and McKinley. Sergeant Farley testified that neither
his contemporaneous notes of what was being reported to him by the task force members, nor his later reports, based

on discussions with his fellow officers, indicated that any of the task force members witnessed an exchange between
Ford and McKinley on November 10. Docket No. 79 at 73–74.
The transcript presented to the jury, which omits the speakers' identities, reads as follows (“-” denotes a break in the
sentence and, at times, a change in the speaker):

As I will address in more detail below, the Sentencing Guidelines define “crack” cocaine as “a form of cocaine base,
usually prepared by processing cocaine hydrochloride and sodium bicarbonate, and usually appearing in a lumpy, rocklike
form.” U.S.S.G. § 2D 1.1(d).

13 While McKinley testified at one point that he had not entered the restaurant, he did so tentatively. On direct examination,

McKinley testified:

Q. And did you go into the Midway at any time during your—
A. I don't remember. I might have. I might have stepped in there. I might have stepped out.
Q. Did you leave the general area?
A. No.
Q. Okay, so you were either in front of or went into the Midway maybe?
A. I was directly in front of it. I didn't go nowhere.
Q. Okay. Do you recall if you went in or not or you're not sure? A. I didn't go in.

Docket No. 79 at 159–60. During cross-examination, McKinley went on to testify as follows:

Q. Now did you tell us yesterday that you never went into the Midway Diner on November the 10th?
A. I wasn't—two years ago—I wasn't sure of every movement. I don't know if I briefly stopped in there or if I stayed

outside. But, I'm most likely positive I was outside the whole time.

Q. Okay. So, you're most likely positive that you were outside the whole time. So that, if Sgt. Farley testified that

you went inside, he would be mistaken?

A. Probably so. It was two years ago to him too. He's probably not sure of every movement too.

The Third Circuit has explained the distinction between “crack” and “freebase,” another form of cocaine base, as follows:
Cocaine is a naturally occurring substance that is derived from the leaves of the erythroxylon plant. United States
Sentencing  Commission,  Special  Report  to  the  Congress:  Cocaine  and  Federal  Sentencing  Policy,  at  vi  (1995)
[hereinafter “Special Report” ]. There are five basic forms of the drug: coca leaves, coca paste, powder cocaine,
freebase cocaine, and crack cocaine. Id. at 11. There are three base forms of cocaine: coca paste, freebase cocaine,
and crack cocaine. Id. Coca paste, not usually imported into the United States, is “a chunky, off-white to light-brown,
putty-like substance that exists primarily as an intermediate product in the processing of coca leaves into powder
cocaine.” Id.
Both freebase cocaine and crack cocaine are forms of cocaine base produced from powder cocaine. Id. at 13. In
this form, the powder cocaine has been “freed” from the salt substrate and is once again in a base form similar
to that of coca paste. Id. To create freebase cocaine, powder cocaine is dissolved in water and a strong alkaloid
solution, typically ammonia is added, along with another organic solvent like ether. Id. The use of this process was
first documented in the 1970s, but “many resisted the freebasing process because of its complexity and potential
danger. Ether, a highly volatile and flammable solvent, will ignite or explode if the freebase cocaine is smoked before
the ether has evaporated entirely.” Id. Cocaine base prepared using the freebase method was replaced by the crack
method. See, e.g., United States v. Johnson, 976 F.Supp. 284, 290 (D.Del.1997) (“[F]reebase cocaine ... seems to
have outlived its utility with the emergence of crack cocaine.”)
To produce crack cocaine, the powder cocaine is dissolved in a solution of sodium bicarbonate and water, which is
then cooked, leaving a solid substance called crack cocaine. Special Report at 14. “The crack cocaine is broken or
cut into ‘rocks,’ each typically weighing from one-tenth to one-half a gram.” Id. This method is considered to be the
most common method of producing cocaine base. See United States v. Barbosa, 271 F.3d 438, 462 (3d Cir.2001).
“Crack” is not a chemical term; it describes a substance that results from a general method for making cocaine base
out of powder cocaine. See United States v. Waters, 313 F.3d 151, 156 (3d Cir.2002). The Sentencing Guidelines
note, “ ‘[c]rack’ is the street name for a form of cocaine base, usually prepared by processing cocaine hydrochloride
and sodium bicarbonate, and usually appearing in a lumpy rocklike form.” U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(c), Note D. See also
Waters, 313 F.3d at 156.

United States v. Brigman, 350 F.3d 310, 312–13 (3d Cir.2003) (determining that, for purposes of calculating defendant's
sentence  under  the  then-mandatory  sentencing  guidelines,  government  had  proved  by  a  preponderance  of  the
evidence that the defendant distributed “crack” cocaine), abrogated by United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220, 125
S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).

See supra note 3.
My cautionary remark was prompted by an objection by Ford's counsel, in an exchange that proceeded as follows:

Mr. MCGETTIGAN: ... Scrutinize [McKinley's] testimony and consider it, but give him the respect that is due to a
person who at some apprehension and risk to himself cooperated in [sic] the Government—with the Government in
addressing the serious problem of drug sales and at risk—
MS. LEFEBER: Objection, Your Honor.
THE COURT: Overruled.
MR.  MCGETTIGAN:  And  notwithstanding  that  this  has  not  made  him  a  popular  person  in  the  community  of
Coatesville and at the risk of persons who would have him not testify who would intimidate him—
MS. LEFEBER: Objection, Your Honor.
MR. MCGETTIGAN:—to come in here and testify—
MS. LEFEBER: Objection.
THE COURT: I think that's a little much, Mr. McGettigan.

THE COURT: Yeah, let's leave that alone. All right?

The government accuses Ford's counsel of fabricating aspects of McKinley's criminal history during this argument. While
Ford's counsel was permitted to cross-examine McKinley about his convictions for drug distribution and shooting into the
window of an occupied vehicle, counsel's opening argument did allude to aspects of McKinley's criminal history that she

was ultimately barred from inquiring into at trial. However, she had a good-faith basis for making these allusions. At one
of several pretrial conferences held the week before trial for the purpose of addressing discovery disputes, the prosecutor
confirmed that the government had not produced evidence of Kevin McKinley's criminal history, despite the defendant
having requested the material in discovery motions filed several months before trial, pursuant to Giglio v. United States,
405 U.S. 150, 92 S.Ct. 763, 31 L.Ed.2d 104 (1972). Docket No. 76 (Transcript of Pretrial Conference, January 17, 2008) at
10–13. (Ford's counsel represented, at these conferences, that the government had also failed to produce other evidence
to which the defendant was entitled, including audible copies of the recordings that constituted the prosecution's primary
evidence against Ford.) I directed the government to authorize the Chester County probation department to produce
a copy of McKinley's most recent presentence investigation (“PSI”) report, which the government theretofore had not
done. At a subsequent pretrial conference, after Ford received a copy of McKinley's PSI report, I granted Ford's counsel
permission to cross-examine Mr. McKinley, at trial, as to each of the arrests reported in the PSI report. Docket No. 78
at 11–12. My subsequent evidentiary rulings at trial in part limiting Ford's counsel's cross-examination of McKinley with
regard to his prior convictions were not entirely consistent with this earlier determination.
The full exchange is as follows:

MS. LEFEBER: The entire case depends on Mr. McKinley's word. The evidence will show that he's led a lifetime of
crime, and his word can't be believed. Robberies, stabbings, drugs, drugs, drugs, and more drugs. That was how
he supported himself, and every—all the time that he was wheeling and dealing drugs on the streets of Coatesville
in front of the Midway Diner and VFW bar, he was carrying a gun, sticking up people, and terrorizing people with
that gun.
MR. MCGETTIGAN: Your Honor—
MS. LEFEBER: But things change.
MR. MCGETTIGAN: You're Honor, excuse me. Your Honor, I'm going to object. Counsel is—
THE COURT: All right.
MR. MCGETTIGAN:—making something up here.
THE COURT: I don't think we need to pursue that.
MS. LEFEBER: Could we ask Mr. McGettigan not to make statements like counsel is making something up. I think
that's inappropriate.
THE COURT: I don't think—I think Mr. McGettigan doesn't need to say that, and I don't think we need to talk about
terrifying—
MS. LEFEBER: Things—
THE COURT:—the population.

This exchange proceeded as follows:

[BY MR. MCGETTIGAN] Q. Okay. And eventually as a result of those phone calls, did you make a phone call and
contact the defendant, Harold Ford?
[MCKINLEY] A. Yes.
MS. LEFEBER: Objection, Your Honor. Can we like not lead the witness?
MR. MCGETTIGAN: Your Honor, that's not a leading question. MS. LEFEBER: Just ask him who you called and—
MR. MCGETTIGAN: Your Honor, with all due respect—
MS. LEFEBER:—not spoon feed him?
MR. MCGETTIGAN: Counsel doesn't understand what['s] leading—that's not—
MS. LEFEBER: Objection.

See Pitner v. Murrin, Civil No. 07–355 (E.D. Pa. filed January 29, 2007). In Pitner, the plaintiffs alleged that Corporal
McEvoy and other officers engaged in a search that was undertaken pursuant to a warrant, but which was nonetheless
unlawful. Pitner v. Murrin, Civil No. 07–355 (E.D. Pa. filed January 29, 2007). Specifically, plaintiffs alleged that, to obtain
the search warrant, the officers filed an affidavit stating that one of the plaintiffs, driving a Ford Bronco, picked up a street-
level drug dealer, who had informed an undercover agent that he was waiting to get marijuana from his supplier, and that
the street-level dealer soon returned with marijuana on hand. See id., Second Am. Compl. ¶ 18. Plaintiffs further alleged
that, prior to executing their search, the officers had “no information that plaintiffs were involved in any criminal activity.”
Id. ¶ 36. After Ford's trial, the court awarded summary judgment to defendants and, in so doing, found that Corporal
McEvoy did not swear to the facts alleged in the affidavit, and did not participate in drafting the affidavit. See Pitner v.
Murrin, Civil No. 07–355, 2008 WL 2552807, at *1 (E.D.Pa. June 25, 2008).

22 While it may be the case that the cross-examination of Corporal McEvoy should have been curtailed given the minimal
probative value of the inquiry, Ford's counsel was not, in fact, “lying.” In their second amended complaint, in Pitner v.
Murrin, described in footnote 21, supra, plaintiffs alleged that, although McEvoy did not sign the affidavit used to obtain
the search warrant, he was one of the affiants. Second Amended Complaint ¶ 16, Pitner, No. 07–355.

And  I'll  tell  you,  in  thinking  about  a  case,  even  relatively  brief  cases,  sometimes  lawyers  will  discuss  with  their
colleagues, and I think, what's the expression, you look for a devil's advocate, and you talk about your case a little bit.
And, now, you can do that in this case. One of the things you can say is gee, you know, I would have liked to have
had an officer who was placing recorders and transmitters, who was really familiar with Coatesville, who wasn't a
University of Pennsylvania officer. And then my colleague would say, well, isn't Coatesville a small town with maybe
just one or two police officers devoted to narcotics? So you'd have to have a task force, you have to have others.
Okay. Fine.
But then I said, well, gee, I'd really like to have a witness buy a half an ounce and an ounce of drugs, who didn't have
a lengthy criminal history involving drugs and contact with criminals and stuff like that.
And my colleague would say, well, gee, a nun, a priest, a person with no criminal history might have a tough time
buying an ounce or two, or an ounce, or a half ounce of crack cocaine in Coatesville.

So I had to admit, there is some sense in that. So then you say, geez, you think I could have recorded tapes that
didn't have a lot of background noise, and that you can hear audibly and just more of them. And my colleague would
say, well, it's probably not reasonable to shut down traffic on Main Street in Coatesville and putting [sic] a big, visible
microphone on your cooperator. It really might not be conducive to being able to buy drugs.
So I said, well, gee, you know, I'd really like to have an agent who could drive to an unfamiliar place, use a two-way
radio, follow people while they're walking, not be seen and take notes, all at the same time.
And my colleague said, well when they get an agent with three arms, you'll probably get that. I said, hum, I'd like
someone to be real close to these transactions.
They said, that's pretty hard to do in an urban area where the police might be known.
And, finally, I said, gee, you know, can I have a police officer who hasn't been sued? And my colleague said, well,
weren't you, the defense attorney and the Judge in your last drug case all sued? And I had to admit, he had a point.
You can sue anyone you want.

Docket No. 81 (Transcript of Trial, January 28, 2008) at 10–12. Then, while addressing the reliability of Kevin McKinley's
testimony, the prosecutor continued:

And that's one other thing I asked my colleague. I said, you know, you'd think I could have a witness who would
speak up, who would really stand—get next to that microphone and talk to the Court. And my colleague said, well,
those are the actors, not real people.

Docket No. 81 at 14.

The prosecutor said, in full:

So, I'm going to give you a little background, just in the way to look at this case. With the principles that apply to
criminal cases generally. It's kind of an interesting thing. Something that was pointed to me years ago. The arguments
against the non-occurrence of a criminal act are limited to three.
Three things. (a) It didn't happen. That's number one—well, one. It didn't happen. There was no crime. No crime,
in fact, occurred.
Okay? For instance, the person you thought was dead, they turn up. The money you thought was stolen was just
misplaced. So no crime occurred. The act itself didn't occur. Okay. Two, the act occurred, but there's an excuse, or
a justification. Well I didn't hit first, it was self-defense. Or for instance, I'll tell you what, but for my role here today in
this courtroom, this [—the prosecutor took the package of cocaine base that was marked as a government exhibit
and placed the package under his suit jacket—] would be a criminal offense.
But I have an excuse. This is my job. So, that's two of the explanations of why a crime hasn't occurred. Well, and
then there's the third. And that's how we arrive here. The third is, well it happened, the crime happened. There's no
excuse, no justification. But it wasn't me.
So what you'll hear—what you understand here is a defense of—an argument, excuse me, of last resort, well because
—and I think counsel, and correct me if I'm wrong, it's your recollection that controls, counsel, in her opening said,
well, there were drugs purchased that day, no question about that.
And as far as I know, there's no excuse or justification present. These aren't prescription drugs.
So, by a last resort, we arrive at, it wasn't me.

Docket No. 81 at 15–16.
Ford's counsel said, in full:

25

The truth in this case is that this Government wants to keep the truth from you. They wanted to keep the truth from
you. They don't want you to know the real facts and the real truth. Do you remember when Corporal McEvoy was
on the stand? The first question out of the box I asked him was, you arrested Mr. Ford, didn't you?
Yeah. Did he have any drugs on him? Did he have any drug paraphernalia? Did he have large sums of money?
Did he have anything on him at all?
I don't remember. And before I asked McEvoy that, I asked the Government for a stipulation, can you stipulate that
when you arrested my client, nothing on him but $37? Oh, no, we can't, we can't agree to that. So I ask the witnesses.
Okay? McEvoy, at first he didn't recall, but then I think he did. And, of course, it's your recollection. And the truth
is, the truth came out through Agent Wood.
Thirty-seven dollars on him when they arrested him. No drugs. No drugs found in his home. No guns, no scales,
nothing. Why didn't the Government want you to know that? Why did they try so hard to keep that from you?

Docket No. 81 at 31–32.

Ford's counsel argued (with some inaccuracy as to McKinley's testimony about whether he went inside the Midway Diner):
I have to get up on cross-examination and ask them to play the tapes of Kevin McKinley's drug dealing, minutes
before he meets Harold Ford at the Midway, with Martinez. And if you recall the Government, oh, we don't have
those tapes, we can't play those. Oh, and we didn't bring them along.
They brought them, and we eventually got them to play them for you. Remember that call at, I believe it was 11:49am
on November the 10th, to Martinez? You heard it loud and clear. Half ounce of crack cocaine. Kevin McKinley wanted
to get [crack] from Mr. Martinez, who I think there's testimony that they arrested him at some point, but they didn't
see him that day.
Half an ounce, loud and clear. In 40 minutes. It was 11:49 on November the 10th. Forty minutes later, Officer Farley
told you, is just about when Kevin McKinley gets to the Midway.
And goes inside the Midway. Officer Farley—Sergeant Farley told you he went into the Midway. There's no officers
in the Midway. The Government didn't play that tape for you, I had to play that tape for you.
How  about  the  next  conversation?  Minutes  later,  minutes  before  this  supposed  deal  went  down  between  Kevin
McKinley  and  Harold  Ford,  another  conversation,  there's  some  unknown  drug  dealer.  Well,  you  can't  arrest  an
unknown can you?

...

In  those  conversations,  see,  people,  McKinley  and  the  unknown  and  Martinez,  they  actually  engaged  in  drug
transactions. They discussed them. You heard them on the tapes. The Government didn't play that for you, they
want to keep the truth from you, ladies and gentlemen.

Docket No 81 at 32–34.

Specifically, Ford's counsel said:

27

Do you recall how he recalled, with the greatest of precision imaginable, that on that day we left an undisclosed
location and we turned southbound on 7th Street and northbound on Merchant and eastbound on Lincoln, and so
and so, and at such a time I parked at the so and so and got—McKinley and Ford were five to seven feet, this far
apart, and I was located a block and a half away.
A block being at least the size of this courtroom. And I saw this and I saw that. And I witnessed a handshake. And
he remembered all of that with the greatest precision, he was very impressive at that time. Until cross-examination.
And the first question out of the box was, do you recall when Mr. Ford was arrested? Did he have any drugs on him?
Oh, I don't recall. You don't recall? What do you have, selective memory? You recall somebody walking eastbound
on Merchant, or westbound on Lincoln Highway, and you don't recall whether the person who is the target of this
whole thing who we're trying to prosecute here, you don't recall when you arrested him whether he had drugs on
him? Come on.
Do you have your own agenda? Maybe he's getting points for convicting people, because after all remember he told
you, I was trying to show that he's a busy officer. Remember? Did you work five days a week? Oh, no I worked
six days a week. Okay.
And I think he was one of two narcotics officers in Coatesville. So he must have been very busy, I would assume.
And this did happen two years ago. So when he realized where I was going, all of a sudden he told me he didn't
witness it. Some weeks he didn't even witness a crime. Can you believe—could you believe that? Do you really
believe that, that he didn't witness any crimes?

Docket No. 81 at 50–51.

28

The prosecutor said:

I'd submit that you can infer that Mr. Ford was not locked up for a year, because it was an ongoing investigation.
Kevin McKinley cooperated and made other buys. And if you lock someone up on the first day, the person who's the
cooperator is useless for the rest of your activities. Instead, and I tried to follow this argument a little bit. And there
were a lot of lawyer noises being made there, and I couldn't follow them all. And one of them said, why wasn't he
locked up for a year? Because we didn't believe him. And I've been in this business for awhile.
I want to hear that conversation, boss, we've been letting this sit out there for a year, we don't believe the guy, let's
lock somebody up.

These milder instances of vouching include the prosecutor's improper claim of authority—“I've been in this business for
awhile”—that preceded an otherwise appropriate argument that the government would have little incentive to lock up
Kevin McKinley. Docket No. 81 at 64–65. The prosecutor's vouching during rebuttal was also echoed in his appeal to facts
outside the record in his initial closing argument when attempting to belittle the significance of Corporal McEvoy having
been sued in connection with another investigation: “And my colleague said, well, weren't you, the defense attorney and
the Judge in your last drug case all sued?” Docket No. 81 at 12.
These remarks are particularly salient, as they immediately preceded the remarks in question and made clear that the
prosecutor was invoking the government's “good name” as such, rather than offering a reasonable inference from the
record about the government's integrity in this case. See Docket No. 81 at 57–58 (“Now, I'm the Government lawyer.
I'm not getting rich. If a trial goes a week, I got to wear the same suit twice.... But when counsel says, the Government
wants to keep the truth from you, well, as a lawyer, you don't have a whole lot, sometimes, but your good name and
when you're accused personally-[.]”).
In  addressing  Ford's  claim  that  these  statements  constitute  vouching,  the  government  focuses  on  the  prosecutor's
statement that Corporal McEvoy was “an honorable police officer doing honorable work.” I agree that this statement, if it
had stood alone, would have been an appropriate response to the defense's allegation that Corporal McEvoy had falsely
testified to witnessing a handshake between Ford and Corporal McEvoy. See United States v. Weatherly, 525 F.3d 265,
271–72 (3d Cir.2008) (holding that, where the defense counsel accused testifying officers of perjury, the prosecutor could
ask “[w]hy would [the officers] risk their 32–34 years of experience on the police force over this case” where the question
“called for an inference based upon evidence in the record”). But, in the case at bar, the prosecutor's gratuitous comments
appear to accord McEvoy's testimony the imprimatur of government endorsement.
The government does not appear to argue that the government's remarks were justified by the “invited response doctrine.”
However, even if the government's brief could be construed to make this claim, I would not find the prosecutor's remarks
so justified. Ford's challenge to the truthfulness of the government's witnesses and the forthrightness of the government's
case was rooted in (1) the testimony of the government witnesses, (2) the existence of potentially exculpatory recordings
of Kevin McKinley's conversations on November 10, and (3) the government's resistance to having those recordings
played for the jury. The defense's argument was thus grounded in the evidence and was not articulated in markedly
personal terms. See United States v. Weatherly, 525 F.3d 265, 272 (3d Cir.2008) (“It is permissible for counsel to argue
inferences, but an inference must flow logically and convincingly from the facts in the record.”); see also Dispoz–O–
Plastics, 172 F.3d at 285 (“We have generally found the invited response doctrine to be applicable only in instances
where the prosecution team was attacked for reasons unsupported by the evidence at trial.”).

As I instructed at the beginning of the government's rebuttal, the government was certainly entitled to address the
defense's  challenge  to  its  candor,  but  it  was  not  permitted  to  cast  that  argument  in  “excessively  personal  terms.”
Reviewing the prosecutor's remarks in light of the trial record and based on my observations of the case, I find that
the prosecutor's vouching was far in excess of any attack that was justified by the conduct of Ford's counsel. See
United States v. Wood, 486 F.3d 781, 788 (3d Cir.2007) (“The invited response doctrine protects comments made
in  reasonable  response  to  improper  attacks  by  defense  counsel....  But  though  a  prosecutor  may  use  the  doctrine
defensively, he may not do so offensively.”) (internal quotation marks omitted). I further note that the defense's closing
argument, while aggressive in its attacks on the government, was a not-unwarranted response to the prosecutor's
closing-argument characterizing the defense's trial strategy as one “of last resort.”

The government argues that it was justified in accusing Ford's counsel of “making something up,” Docket No. 79 at 32,
because she characterized McKinley as having “led a lifetime of crime,” including “[r]obberies, stabbings, drugs, drugs,
drugs, and more drugs,” and “carrying a gun, sticking up people, and terrorizing people with that gun.” Docket No. 79 at
31–32. According to the government, this characterization of McKinley's criminal history “bore no basis in fact (except for
the drug trafficking, which was brought out by the government in it's [sic] opening statement.)” Docket No. 89 at 29.

However, while Ford's characterization of McKinley's criminal history was hyperbolic, and thus invited some response
from the prosecutor, the statements were moored in fact. As addressed above, McKinley's lengthy criminal history
included,  in  addition  to  numerous  other  firearm  charges,  a  2002  charge  for  making  terroristic  threats  and  2003
convictions, pursuant to a guilty plea, for reckless endangerment and carrying an illegal firearm. The 2003 convictions
were based on McKinley shooting into the window of an occupied vehicle. Docket No. 80 at 62–63. While the references
by Ford's counsel to “robberies, stabbings,” and “sticking up people” were based on information that was ultimately

excluded from evidence, the information was not “made up,” but was drawn from a presentence investigation report of
McKinley that defense counsel had received from the government just days before the trial.
Thus, the prosecutor's allegation was one that was “unsupported by the record evidence,” Rivas, 493 F.3d at 139,
and was an inappropriate response to Ford's opening argument. See United States v. Pelullo, 964 F.2d 193, 218 (3d
Cir.1992) (stating that attorneys may not accuse each other of “misconduct, such as subornation of perjury, unless there
is a foundation in the record to support such charges”); see also Dispoz–OPlastics, 172 F.3d at 285 (“We have generally
found the invited response doctrine to be applicable only in instances where the prosecution team was attacked for
reasons unsupported by the evidence at trial.”).

Ford raises other claims which, if they were to be addressed, would be subject to plain error review. For example, Ford
contends that the prosecutor improperly shifted the burden of proof to the defendant by categorizing Ford's arguments,
under what the prosecutor characterized as “principles that apply to criminal law generally,” as a “defense of ... last
resort.” Docket No. 81 at 15–16; see United States v. Balter, 91 F.3d 427, 441 (3d Cir.1996). (“[T]he prosecution ... may
not improperly suggest that the defendant has the burden to produce evidence.”). Because I find that the jury's verdict
must be set aside on other grounds, I will not reach these claims.
Such  an  argument  was  not  only  inappropriate,  it  was  false  as  a  representation  of  the  value  of  asserting  a  defense
of misidentification. That innocent people are convicted of crimes they did not commit is not a new or a controversial
proposition.  See,  e.g.,  Edwin  Borchard,  Convicting  the  Innocent:  Sixty  Five  Actual  Errors  of  Criminal  Justice  (1932)
(detailing sixty-five cases of wrongful convictions); Hugo Adam Bedau and Michael L. Radelet, Miscarriages of Justice
in Potentially Capital Cases, 40 Stan. L.Rev. 21 (1987) (analyzing 350 cases from the 20th century in which defendants
convicted of capital or potentially capital crimes were later been found to be innocent); The Innocence Project, www.
innocenceproject.org (last visited April 20, 2009) (detailing activities of organization, founded in 1992, whose efforts have
led to the exoneration of 235 people nationwide who had been wrongfully convicted).

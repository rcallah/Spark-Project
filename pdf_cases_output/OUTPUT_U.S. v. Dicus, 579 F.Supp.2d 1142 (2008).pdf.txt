*1144   At  a  sentencing  hearing  on  September  9,  2008,
I  announced  that  I  was  reducing  the  defendant's  sentence
from the high end to the low end of his advisory guidelines
range  as  a  sanction  for  the  prosecution's  serious  breach
of  the  defendant's  plea  agreement.  I  would  otherwise  have
sentenced  the  defendant  at  the  top  of  his  guidelines  range
based  on  his  sales  of  marijuana  to  minors,  which  was
a  factor  not  reflected  in  his  advisory  guidelines  range.
However,  the  Chief  Judge  of  our  district  had  already
found  the  prosecution's  breach  of  the  plea  agreement  to
be  prosecutorialmisconduct,  and  I  imposed  the  sentence
reduction,  at  the  defendant's  request,  as  the  appropriate
sanction  for  such  serious  misconduct.  I  now  enter  this
memorandum opinion and order to memorialize more fully
my rationale for granting a sentence reduction as a targeted
remedy for serious and recidivist prosecutorialmisconduct.

I. INTRODUCTION

A. Factual Background

In  a  plea  agreement,  dated  May  29,  2007,  the  parties
stipulated to the following pertinent facts:

A.  On  March  10,  2006,  Tami  Dicus  [a  co-defendant]
knowingly  and  intentionally  distributed  marijuana  to
C.W. and S.C., minors under the age of 18 years old.

B.  On  March  13,  2006,  the  Marion  Police  Department
executed a search on the Dicus residence [in] Marion,
IA.  At  the  time  of  the  search  both  Tami  and  David
Dicus  resided  at  the  residence.  Defendant's  residence
[in] Marion, IA, is located within 1,000 feet of Hannah
Park, a playground. During this search the Marion Police
Department seized the following:

- $3,170 cash in drug proceeds;

- Four gallon bags of marijuana;

- marijuana cigarettes;

*1145  - miscellaneous drug paraphernalia, including a

digital scale;

- ammunition; and

- letters discussing their drug activity.

Defendant and Tami Dicus knowingly and intentionally
possessed  these  items.  Defendant  and  Tami  Dicus
intended  to  distribute  some  or  all  of  the  marijuana.
The $3,170 constituted proceeds of defendant and Tami
Dicus's prior marijuana sales.

* * *

E.  Defendant  stipulates  and  agrees  that  he  devised  and
lead [sic] the marijuana distribution conspiracy. As the
leader,  defendant  made  all  the  arrangements  with  the
suppliers and purchased all the marijuana he and Tami
Dicus sold during the conspiracy.

F.  Defendant  and  Tami  Dicus  distributed  marijuana  to
C.W.  over  30  times  between  2005  and  March  13,
2006. During that period, C.W. purchased a quarter of
an  ounce  of  marijuana  (7  grams)  on  twenty  or  more
occasions,  an  ounce  on  two  occasions,  and  something
less than a quarter of an ounce on other occasions. At
the  time  of  the  distributions,  C.W.  was  16  years  of
age.  Additionally,  C.W.  used  marijuana  in  the  Dicus
residence  with  defendant  and/or  Tami  Dicus  on  four
occasions.

* * *

J.  Defendant  and  Tami  Dicus  distributed  marijuana  to
S.C.  around  20  times.  During  that  period,  S.C.  would
typically purchase a “dub” (4 grams) of marijuana each
time. At the time of the distributions, S.C. was 16 years
of  age.  Additionally,  on  at  least  three  occasions,  S.C.
used marijuana with defendant and Tami Dicus in the

L.  Defendant  stipulates  and  agrees

convicted felon, having been previously convicted of the
following:

that  he 

-  On  about  July  15,  1998  in  the  Iowa  District  Court
in  and  for  Linn  County,  Iowa,  case  number  FECR
23666, defendant was sentenced for the Class D Felony
offense of Possession with Intent to Deliver a Controlled
Substance and the Class D felony offense of Dominion
and Control of a Firearm as a Felon.

- On or about September 29, 1992 in the Iowa District
Court in and for Linn County, Iowa, case number CRF
13034, defendant was sentenced for the felony offense
of Operating While Intoxicated, Third Offense.

Plea  Agreement  (docket  no.  27-2)  (attached  to  minutes  of
May 31, 2007, plea hearing).

The plea agreement also included a handwritten addition that,
with the exception of an enhancement based on Dicus's role
in  the  offense,  there  would  be  “[n]o  other  enhancements
making the adjusted offense level 25 after 3 levels downward
for acceptance.” Plea Agreement, § 8 (emphasis added). The
court finds that this stipulation was part of the consideration
for the plea agreement.

B. Procedural Background

1. The charges and Dicus's plea
On April 18, 2007, a Grand Jury handed down an Indictment
(docket  no.  5)  charging  David  Dicus  with  the  following
offenses: Count 1 charged Dicus with conspiracy to distribute
and to possess with intent to distribute marijuana within 1,000
feet of a playground in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1),
846, and 860; Count 3 *1146  charged Dicus with possession
with  intent  to  distribute  marijuana  within  1,000  feet  of  a
playground after a prior conviction for a felony drug offense
in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1), 851, and 860; Count
4  charged  Dicus  with  maintaining  a  place  for  the  purpose
of  using  marijuana  within  1,000  feet  of  a  playground  in
violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 856(a)(1) and 860; and Count 5

charged Dicus with being an unlawful user of marijuana and
a felon in possession of ammunition in violation of 18 U.S.C.
§§  922(g)(1),  922(g)(3),  and  924(a)(2). 1   The  Indictment
included  forfeiture  allegations  pertaining  to  currency,  any
firearms, and ammunition.

On  May  29,  2007,  Dicus  entered  into  the  plea  agreement
referenced above, agreeing to plead guilty to Counts 1 and 5,
and on May 31, 2007, he entered a guilty plea to those charges
before a magistrate judge of this court. In the plea agreement,
the  parties  made  the  following  stipulations  with  respect  to
Dicus's advisory Sentencing Guidelines calculation:

8.  The  parties  stipulate  and  agree  that  the  United  States

Sentencing Guidelines should be applied as follows:

A. For Count 1 of the Indictment:

Under  USSG  §  2D1.2(a)(3)  the  offense  level  should
be  calculated  by  starting  with  a  base  offense  level  of
26  because  the  offense  occurred  within  1,000  feet  of
a protected location and involved persons less than 18
years of age. The parties further stipulate and agree that
there are no applicable specific offense characteristics.
The Chapter Two offense level for Count 1 is 26.

B. For Count 5 of the Indictment:

Under  USSG[  ]  §  2K2.1  the  offense  level  should  be
calculated  by  starting  with  a  base  offense  level  of 14,
because defendant was a prohibited person at the time he
possessed the ammunition. The parties further stipulate
and agree that there are no applicable specific offense
characteristics. The Chapter Two offense level for Count
5 is Level 14.

C. Role in the Offense

The parties stipulate and agree based upon [D]efendant's
leadership  role  in  the  offense,  [D]efendant  should
receive  a  two-level  upward  adjustment.  Defendant's
adjusted offense level is 28. Defendant was a supervisor
or leader of the conspiracy during the commission of the
offenses.

No other enhancements making the adjusted offense level
25 after 3 levels downward for acceptance.

D. Acceptance of Responsibility

For Educational Use Only

U.S. v. Dicus, 579 F.Supp.2d 1142 (2008)

The  parties  stipulate  and  agree,  that  as  of  the  date
of  this  agreement,  [D]efendant  appears  to  qualify  for
a  two-level  downward  adjustment  for  acceptance  of
responsibility.... If, at the time of sentencing, the court
grants a two-level reduction under U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1(a),
the  United  States  agrees  to  make  a  motion  under
USSG § 3E1.1(b) for an additional one-level reduction,
acknowledging  the  timeliness  of  the  [D]efendant's
decision to plead guilty.

9.  The  [D]efendant,  his  attorney  and  the  United  States
may  make  whatever  comment  and  evidentiary  offer
they  deem  appropriate  at  the  time  of  the  guilty  plea,
sentencing or any other proceeding related to this case,
so long as the offer or comment does not  *1147  violate
any other provision of this agreement....

Plea Agreement, at §§ 8-9 (all emphasis in original, except
handwritten words italicized and offense levels bolded). On
June 18, 2007, Chief Judge Linda R. Reade, to whom this case
was then assigned, accepted the magistrate judge's Report and
Recommendation that the court accept Dicus's guilty plea to
Counts 1 and 5. Chief Judge Reade set Dicus's sentencing for
December 5, 2007.

2. The PSIR and sentencing arguments
On  October  29,  2007,  the  probation  office  filed  a  sealed
presentence investigation report (PSIR) recommending, inter
alia,  that  Dicus  be  sentenced  as  a  career  offender,  with
an  adjusted  base  offense  level  of  29  and  criminal  history
category III, based, in part, on Dicus's 1992 conviction for
Operating While Intoxicated, Third Offense (1992 OWI 3rd),
which was identified in the plea agreement. Plea Agreement,
§ 23, ¶ L. On November 21, 2007, Dicus filed a Sentencing
Memorandum (docket no. 45), asserting that the prosecution
was  bound  by  the  plea  agreement  that  there  would  be  no
enhancements or any finding of career offender status. Dicus
also argued that his 1992 OWI 3rd offense was too old to be
properly counted to establish his career offender status. Also
on  November  21,  2007,  the  prosecution  filed  a  Sentencing
Memorandum (docket no. 44) in which, notwithstanding the
terms of the plea agreement, the prosecution expressly argued
that Dicus should be sentenced as a career offender as defined
in U.S.S.G. § 4B1.1, with an adjusted offense level of 29 after
a reduction for acceptance of responsibility. The only other
issue addressed in the prosecution's Sentencing Memorandum

was Dicus's ability to pay a fine. On November 27, 2007, the
prosecution also filed a Response To Defendant's Sentencing
Memorandum  (docket  no.  46),  in  which  the  prosecution
argued that the plea agreement did not prevent the prosecution
from arguing that Dicus qualifies as a career offender.

3. The prosecutorialmisconduct issue
On November 29, 2007, Chief Judge Reade entered an order
(docket no. 49) requiring supplemental briefs from the parties
concerning  whether  the  prosecution  had  breached  the  plea
agreement and what remedy would be appropriate if the court
found such a breach, expressly directing the parties' attention
to  United  States  v.  Mosley,  505  F.3d  804  (8th  Cir.2007),
which  had  just  been  decided  on  October  12,  2007.  Chief
Judge  Reade  subsequently  reset  the  sentencing  hearing  for
December 17, 2007.

filed 

The  prosecution 
its  Supplemental  Sentencing
Memorandum  (docket  no.  51)  on  December  3,  2007,  and
Dicus  filed  his  Supplemental  Sentencing  Memorandum
(docket  no.  55)  on  December  9,  2007.  By  sealed  order
dated December 12, 2007, Chief Judge Reade found a “clear
violation” by the prosecution of the handwritten unnumbered
paragraph  of  the  plea  agreement  stipulating  that  “no  other
enhancement” applied and that Dicus's adjusted offense level
after a reduction for acceptance of responsibility would be 25.
Based upon her finding of a breach of the plea agreement,
Chief Judge Reade found that, pursuant to Mosley, 505 F.3d
at 809-12, and Santobello v. New York, 404 U.S. 257, 262-62,
92 S.Ct. 495, 30 L.Ed.2d 427 (1971), she had no choice but
to recuse herself from this case. Therefore, she cancelled the
sentencing  hearing  scheduled  for  December  17,  2007,  and
directed that the Clerk of Court reassign the case to another
district court judge. This matter was then reassigned to me.

*1148 C. The Sentencing Hearing

I reset Dicus's sentencing hearing for September 9, 2008. On
April 16, 2008, in the interim between reassignment of the
case and the sentencing hearing, the United States Supreme
Court decided Begay v. United States, --- U.S. ----, 128 S.Ct.
1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008), in which the Court held that a
felony offense of driving while under the influence of alcohol
is  not  a  “violent  felony”  within  the  meaning  of  the  Armed
Career Criminal Act. On May 15, 2008, the Eighth Circuit

U.S. v. Dicus, 579 F.Supp.2d 1142 (2008)

Court of Appeals held that, pursuant to Begay, felony offenses
of driving while under the influence of alcohol do not qualify
as violent felonies under the Armed Career Criminal Act and
do  not  permit  application  of  the  career  offender  guideline,
U.S.S.G. § 4B1.1. United States v. Heikes, 525 F.3d 662, 664
(8th Cir.2008).

At the sentencing hearing on September 9, 2008, the parties
agreed, and I found, that in the wake of Begay, Dicus could
no longer be sentenced as a career offender, notwithstanding
the  probation  office's  prior  recommendation  of  such  an
enhancement and the prosecution's prior argument for such
an enhancement. The parties also agreed, and I found, that the
probation office had rescored Dicus's total offense level as 25,
his criminal history category as III, and his resulting advisory
Sentencing Guidelines range as 70 to 87 months.

Dicus  then  reiterated  his  argument  that  his  1992  OWI
3rd  offense  was  too  old  to  be  properly  considered  for
determination of his criminal history category, adding that the
State  of  Iowa  wipes  the  slate  clean  after  12  years  for  such
an offense, so that his criminal history category should be I.
The prosecution argued that the State of Iowa only wipes the
slate clean for administrative purposes of driver's licensing,
but that the offense remains a prior felony conviction. Dicus's
attorney conceded that he was making the argument about the
effect of the 1992 OWI 3rd offense at his client's request. I
found that the 1992 OWI 3rd offense was within the pertinent
fifteen-year  period  for  consideration  of  Dicus's  criminal
history, because Dicus had received a five-year prison term
and  was  paroled  on  October  15,  1994.  Thus,  I  found  that,
notwithstanding Dicus's objections, Dicus's criminal history
category remained III.

to  argue 

that  he  wished 

Dicus  next  asserted 
the
“reasonableness” of the sentence in light of the misconduct on
the part of the prosecution in breaching the plea agreement.
Dicus argued that the prosecution had “gotten the benefit” of
the Supreme Court's decision in Begay, in that the decision
in  Begay  appeared  to  remedy  the  prosecution's  misconduct
in seeking a career offender enhancement based on the 1992
OWI 3rd offense, notwithstanding contrary provisions in the
plea agreement, so that the prosecution should still have some
accountability for blatantly disregarding the plea agreement.
Therefore, he sought a sentence at the low end of his advisory
Sentencing  Guidelines  range  as  the  appropriate  sanction
for  the  prosecution's  misconduct.  The  prosecution,  now

represented by a different Assistant United States Attorney,
argued  that,  even  if  the  violation  of  the  plea  agreement
was “clear” or “blatant,” it was not in “bad faith,” and was
more  in  the  nature  of  a  “technical”  violation,  because  the
career offender provision was not what one would ordinarily
consider an “enhancement.” The prosecution also suggested
that the career offender argument had been more in the way
of informing the court of the circumstances pertinent to the
defendant's sentence.

Contrary to the prosecution's frivolous and grossly inaccurate
assertions, the record plainly establishes that the parties had
*1149   known  about  the  1992  OWI  3rd  offense  and  its
possible  effect  on  Dicus's  status  as  a  career  offender  from
at  least  as  early  as  the  date  of  the  plea  agreement,  and,
indeed, the probation office had already brought the offense
and its impact on Dicus's possible career offender status to
the  court's  attention  in  the  October  29,  2007,  PSIR,  before
the prosecution filed its Sentencing Memorandum expressly
arguing for a career offender enhancement. Thus, there was
no need for the prosecution to bring the career offender issue
to  the  court's  attention.  The  record  also  plainly  established
that the prosecution's agreement not to seek career offender
status  based  on  the  1992  OWI  3rd  offense  was  part  of
the  consideration  for  the  plea  agreement,  where  a  career
offender  enhancement  would  almost  double,  or  even  more
than  double,  Dicus's  potential  sentence.  Finally,  the  record
plainly establishes that the prosecution did more than simply
advise the court of the possibility of a career offender issue;
the  prosecution  affirmatively  argued  for  application  of  a
career offender enhancement, notwithstanding the “no other
enhancements” provision of the plea agreement.

Consequently, I found as follows:

I think it's beyond blatant. I think it's egregious. To enter
into an agreement that you're going to do something and
do  a  180-degree  turn  and  then  actually  argue  for  the
enhancement in complete violation of the plea agreement?
Why isn't that blatant and egregious? It's one thing if you're
trying to bring information to the judge because you have
a duty as an officer of the Court. But that's not the situation
we have here. It was already brought to the attention of the
judge by probation, and then the government turned around
and argued it in direction violation of the plea agreement.

U.S. v. Dicus, 579 F.Supp.2d 1142 (2008)

... I'm just going with what Judge Reade found, it was a
clear violation and the language of the agreement was plain
and simple and clear and the government breached the plea
agreement. So I'm not making any additional findings. I'm
not-I like your analogy to punitive damages, you know. I'm
not finding any bad faith, although it seems inconceivable
to me that you could breach the plea agreement in the way
the government did it and argue that it was in good faith.

Real  Time  Transcript,  September  8,  2008,  Sentencing
Hearing at 16, 19; see also id. at 27 (reiterating that the breach
was “egregious,” and adding that it was “willful,” although
not  necessarily  “malicious”).  Upon  further  reflection,  and
further opportunity to study the transcript of the sentencing
hearing, I now conclude that the prosecution clearly acted in
bad faith when it breached the plea agreement. Nevertheless,
whether  I  characterize  the  prosecution's  breach  of  the  plea
agreement  as  in  bad  faith  or  not  in  good  faith  makes  no
difference in my decision concerning the appropriate remedy
in this case.

In  light  of  the  prosecution's  egregious  misconduct,  and
the  relief  from  that  misconduct  already  provided-however
serendipitously-by  the  Supreme  Court's  decision  in  Begay,
Dicus  argued  for  some  “positive  benefit”  in  the  form  of  a
sentence  at  the  low  end  of  the  advisory  guidelines  range.
The prosecution chose to offer no arguments concerning the
appropriate sentence.

I  found  that  Dicus's  total  offense  level  is  25  and  that  his
criminal history category is III, which results in an advisory
United  States  Sentencing  Guidelines  range  of  70  to  87
months. I pointed out that Dicus's drug sales to minors would
ordinarily  have  led  me  to  sentence  him  at  the  top  of  the
advisory guidelines range, or indeed, to  *1150  impose an
upward  variance,  because  I  did  not  find  that  such  conduct
was  taken  into  consideration  in  the  guidelines  calculation,
and  that  the  statutory  enhancement  for  such  conduct  was
of  no  consequence,  because  Dicus's  guidelines  range  was
higher  than  the  statutory  enhancement.  I  found,  however,
that  my  belief  that  the  prosecution's  breach  of  the  plea
agreement  was  egregious  and  that  there  ought  to  be  some
consequence to the United States Attorney's Office for that
breach weighed against my inclination to sentence Dicus at
the top of the guidelines range. Therefore, I determined that
Dicus  should  be  sentenced  at  the  bottom  of  the  guidelines

range,  resulting  in  what  is  essentially  a  seventeen-month
reduction in his sentence for the prosecution's breach of the
plea agreement, albeit a “reduction” still within the context of
Dicus's advisory guidelines range. I also found that the low
end of the guidelines range was sufficient to meet all of the
factors in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2), and that none of the other §
3553(a) factors weighed in favor of an upward or downward
variance. Therefore, I concluded that a reasonable sentence
was 70 months and that such a sentence was sufficient, but
no  greater  than  necessary,  to  achieve  all  of  the  sentencing
purposes.

I  turn  now  to  a  fuller  explanation  of  my  legal  rationale
for  granting  a  sentence  reduction  as  a  remedy  for
prosecutorialmisconduct.  I  have  issued  this  ruling  with
speed, but not with haste, within the time for the prosecution
to appeal the sentencing determination, if it should desire to
do so in light of the amplified rationale that I now provide.
However, I note that at no time during the sentencing hearing
did the prosecution object to my sentence at the low end of
the  guidelines  range  based  upon  the  serious  and  recidivist
prosecutorialmisconduct.

II. LEGAL ANALYSIS

A. The Prosecution's Breach Of A Plea Agreement

1. Due process implications
The breach of a plea agreement by the prosecution is a serious
matter:

Allowing the government to breach a promise that induced
a guilty plea violates due process. Santobello v. New York,
404 U.S. 257, 92 S.Ct. 495, 30 L.Ed.2d 427 (1971); [United
States  v.]  Van  Thournout,  100  F.3d  [590,]  594  [  (8th
Cir.1996) ]. Further, “with respect to federal prosecutions,
the courts' concerns run even wider than protection of the
defendant's individual constitutional rights-to concerns for
the honor of the government, public confidence in the fair
administration of justice, and the effective administration
of  justice  in  a  federal  scheme  of  government.”  United
States v. Jensen, 423 F.3d 851, 854 (8th Cir.2005) (internal
citation omitted).

accord  United  States  v.  Sanchez,  508  F.3d  456,  460  (8th
Cir.2007) (“Due process may be violated if there is a breach
of a promise that induced a guilty plea.”). Indeed, breach of
a plea agreement is sufficiently serious that “harmless-error
analysis does not apply when the government breaches a plea
agreement.” United States v. Mosley, 505 F.3d 804, 810 (8th
Cir.2007); see also id. at 812 (reading Santobello to hold that
harmless-error  analysis  does  not  apply  to  breach  of  a  plea
agreement).

2. Recidivist prosecutorialmisconduct in the Northern
District of Iowa
Because of the seriousness of the prosecution's breach of a
plea agreement, it is unfortunate that such incidents are not
unheard of, either in this Circuit or this District. Indeed, just
before  the  breach  of  *1151   the  plea  agreement  occurred
in  this  case,  the  Eighth  Circuit  Court  of  Appeals  held  on
October  12,  2007,  in  United  States  v.  Mosley,  505  F.3d
804 (8th Cir.2007), that the United States Attorney's Office
for  the  Northern  District  of  Iowa  had  also  breached  a
plea  agreement  in  another  case  before  Chief  Judge  Reade
by making improper sentencing arguments. Specifically, in
Mosley,  the  prosecution  had  argued  that  the  defendant  had
failed to accept responsibility because of actions taken before
she signed the plea agreement, after stipulating that, as of the
date of the plea agreement, the defendant appeared to qualify
for a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility.
See505 F.3d at 808-09. Under these circumstances, the United
States  Attorney's  Office  for  the  Northern  District  of  Iowa
should  have  been  particularly  cautious  about  compliance
with the terms of plea agreements at the time of the breach
in  question  here,  which  once  again  involved  arguing  for
sentence determinations that were contrary to stipulations in
a plea agreement. Consequently, the United States Attorney's
Office for the Northern District of Iowa now comes before
me as a “repeat offender,” in light of the violations of plea
agreements, in similar ways and, indeed, within a relatively
short time span, in Mosley and this case. 2

3. The applicable two-step analysis
[1]
  When  a  defendant  asserts  that  the  prosecution  has
breached a plea agreement, the court engages in a two-step
process: The court must first determine whether or not there

has been a breach of the plea agreement, and if there was a
breach, then determine the proper remedy. See, e.g., E.V., 500
F.3d at 751 & 754;accord Mosley, 505 F.3d at 809-12 (where
there  has  been  a  breach  of  the  plea  agreement,  harmless-
error  analysis  does  not  apply,  and  the  court  must  consider
the  proper  remedy).  Here,  Chief  Judge  Reade  has  already
performed  the  first  step  in  the  process,  by  finding  a  “clear
violation”  of  the  plea  agreement  by  the  prosecution.  The
process here is bifurcated, because Chief Judge Reade found
that, under Santobello v. New York, 404 U.S. 257, 262-63, 92
S.Ct. 495, 30 L.Ed.2d 427 (1971), as construed in Mosley, 505
F.3d at 809-12, once she found a breach of the plea agreement,
Dicus had to be sentenced by a different judge to determine
the appropriate remedy for the breach. Mosley, 505 F.3d at
812 (emphasizing that reassignment to a different judge “ ‘is
in no sense to question the fairness of the sentencing judge’
”) (quoting Santobello, 404 U.S. at 263, 92 S.Ct. 495). Thus,
the  second  step  in  the  process  is  left  for  me.  Nevertheless,
because I find that the nature of the breach is relevant to the
proper remedy, I will examine both steps in the process.

B. The Two-Step Analysis Here

1. Step 1: Determination of breach
[2]
 As to the first step in the analysis of an alleged breach
of  a  plea  agreement  by  the  prosecution,  the  Eighth  Circuit
Court  of  Appeals  has  explained,  “Whether  the  government
has breached a plea agreement is a matter of law reviewed
de novo.” Id. at 751 (citing United States v. Van Thournout,
100 F.3d 590, 594 (8th Cir.1996)). More specifically, “[p]lea
agreements are contractual in nature and should be interpreted
according  to  general  contractual  principles.”  Id.;  accord
Sanchez, 508 F.3d at 460;Mosley, 505 F.3d at 808 (“Where
a plea agreement has been accepted  *1152  by the court, we
generally interpret the meaning of the terms of the agreement
according to basic principles of contract law.”). “ ‘[W]hen a
plea rests in any significant degree on a promise or agreement
of  the  prosecutor,  so  that  it  can  be  said  to  be  part  of  the
inducement or consideration, such promise must be fulfilled.’
” Id. at 752 (quoting Santobello, 404 U.S. at 262, 92 S.Ct.
495). Thus, the court looks to see if there is an “enforceable,
bargained-for  term  of  the  plea  agreement”  that  has  been
violated. Id.

U.S. v. Dicus, 579 F.Supp.2d 1142 (2008)

[3]
  Here,  the  handwritten  addition  to  the  plea  agreement,
stating that, apart from an enhancement for role in the offense,
there  would  be  “[n]o  other  enhancements,”  and  that  the
adjusted offense level would, therefore, be “25 after 3 levels
downward for acceptance,” see Plea Agreement (docket no.
27-2),  §  8(D),  was  plainly  a  “bargained-for  term  of  the
plea  agreement,”  E.V.,  500  F.3d  at  752,  as  evidenced  by
its  handwritten  addition  to  the  otherwise  typewritten  plea
agreement.  Moreover,  where  the  existence  of  Dicus's  prior
conviction for the 1992 OWI 3rd was plainly known to the
parties  at  the  time  of  the  plea  agreement,  because  it  was
mentioned in that plea agreement, Plea Agreement, § 23, ¶
L, the agreement to the adjusted offense level and no further
enhancements  was  plainly  an  inducement  to  enter  into  the
agreement. E.V., 500 F.3d at 752. Moreover, I concur fully
in  Chief  Judge  Reade's  finding  that  the  term  of  the  plea
agreement in question was plain and unambiguous, and that
the prosecution's argument for a career offender enhancement
was,  consequently,  “a  clear  violation”  of  that  provision.
Indeed, as explained above, I find that the violation was not
just “clear,” but “egregious,” not least because it went to the
heart of Dicus's inducement to plead guilty to avoid the career
offender  implications  of  the  1992  OWI  3rd  offense  under
pre-Begay law.

Thus,  I  find  that  there  was  not  only  a  breach  of  the  plea
agreement by the prosecution, but an egregious breach.

2. Step 2: Determination of the appropriate remedy
Because Chief Judge Reade found, and I agree, that there was
a breach of the plea agreement, the question that is entirely for
me to decide is the proper remedy for the prosecution's breach
of  the  plea  agreement.  See,  e.g.,  E.V.,  500  F.3d  at  751  &
754;accord Mosley, 505 F.3d at 809-12 (where there has been
a breach of the plea agreement, harmless-error analysis does
not apply, and the court must consider the proper remedy). I
begin that determination by examining the typical remedies
for the prosecution's breach of a plea agreement.

a. The typical remedies

“When  the  government  breaches  a  plea  agreement,  ‘the
defendant  is  typically  given  the  option  of  withdrawing  his
guilty plea or demanding specific performance.’ ” E.V., 500
F.3d at 754 (quoting United States v. Goings, 200 F.3d 539,

544 (8th Cir.2000), with internal citations omitted). Indeed,
most courts, including the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals,
have usually treated withdrawal of the defendant's guilty plea
or  specific  performance  of  the  breached  provision  of  the
agreement  as  the  only  available  options.  See,  e.g.,  Goings,
200  F.3d  at  544  (“Where  it  is  clear  that  the  government
violated the terms of a plea bargain, the defendant is typically
given the option of withdrawing his guilty plea or demanding
specific performance.”); United States v. Mitchell, 136 F.3d
1192, 1194 (8th Cir.1998) (noting that the remedies for breach
of  plea  agreement  are  specific  performance  or  permission
to  withdraw  plea),  cert.  denied,534  U.S.  856,  122  S.Ct.
129,  151  L.Ed.2d  83  (2001);  *1153 United  States  v.  Van
Thournout, 100 F.3d 590, 594 (8th Cir.1996) (“ ‘There are
two potential remedies for the government's breach of a plea
agreement: remand for specific performance and withdrawal
of the guilty plea.’ ”) (quoting Margalli-Olvera, cited infra);
Margalli-Olvera v. I.N.S., 43 F.3d 345, 354-55 (8th Cir.1994)
(  “There  are  two  potential  remedies  for  the  government's
breach of a plea agreement: remand for specific performance
and  withdrawal  of  the  guilty  plea.”);  accord  United  States
v. Cudjoe, 534 F.3d 1349, 1356-57 & n. 4 (10th Cir.2008);
United  States  v.  Griffin,  510  F.3d  354,  367  (2d  Cir.2007);
United  States  v.  Rivera,  357  F.3d  290,  297  (3d  Cir.2004)
(  “  ‘When  the  government  breaches  a  plea  agreement,  the
general  rule  is  to  remand  the  case  to  the  district  court  for
a determination whether to grant specific performance or to
allow  withdrawal  of  the  plea.’  ”)  (quoting  United  States  v.
Nolan-Cooper,  155  F.3d  221,  241  (3d  Cir.1998));  United
States v. Skidmore, 998 F.2d 372, 375 (6th Cir.1993) (if the
prosecution  breaches  a  plea  agreement,  the  breach  may  be
remedied by requiring specific performance or permitting the
defendant to withdraw the plea); United States v. Jefferies,
908  F.2d  1520,  1527  (11th  Cir.1990)  (in  the  event  of  a
breach  of  a  plea  agreement  by  the  prosecution,  there  are
two  available  remedies:  “[t]he  court  can  order  specific
performance  of  the  agreement  or  afford  the  defendant  the
opportunity to withdraw the plea.”). These are, after all, the
two remedies expressly discussed by the Supreme Court in
Santobello, 404 U.S. at 262-63, 92 S.Ct. 495. Of the two, the
Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals has suggested that specific
performance  is  the  preferred  remedy.  Goings,  200  F.3d  at
544;Van  Thournout,  100  F.3d  at  594;Margalli-Olvera,  43
F.3d at 354-55;accord Cudjoe, 534 F.3d at 1357 n. 4 (finding
that resentencing pursuant to the terms of the plea agreement
is  the  preferred  remedy  and  suggesting  that  withdrawal  of
the  guilty  plea  should  only  be  allowed  when  the  breach  is

States v. Brye, 146 F.3d 1207, 1213 (10th Cir.1998)).

a  different  judge  as  the  remedy  that  would  fully  cure  the
prosecution's breach. Id.

In contrast to the assumption that the court must grant one
of these two typical remedies if the prosecution breaches a
plea  agreement,  the  Second  Circuit  Court  of  Appeals  has
recognized that “[t]here is a very limited exception to the need
for a remedy for a plea agreement breach by the government
where  the  violation  is  so  minor  that  it  does  not  cause  the
defendant to suffer any meaningful detriment.” United States
v.  Vaval,  404  F.3d  144,  155  (2d  Cir.2005).  As  that  court
explained,

In  assessing  whether  a  defendant  suffered  a  meaningful
detriment,  the  critical  question  is  what  the  defendant
reasonably  understood  to  be  the  terms  of  the  plea
agreement, and whether his or her reasonable expectations
have  been  fulfilled.  See  Paradiso  v.  United  States,  689
F.2d 28, 31 (2d Cir.1982). For example, in United States
v.  Casamento,  887  F.2d  1141,  1181  (2d  Cir.1989),  we
held  that  the  government  violated  a  plea  agreement  by
submitting a sentencing memorandum without specifically
reserving  its  right  to  do  so.  We  deemed  a  remedy  to  be
unnecessary, however, because the memorandum included
only  brief  statements  that  “could  properly  have  been
presented to the district court as rebuttal to [defendant's]
arguments.” Id. at 1182. Thus, the essential purpose of the
agreement was fulfilled. Similarly, in Paradiso, 689 F.2d at
30-31, we held that no remedy was required for a technical
violation by the court of a binding plea agreement because
the  sentence  imposed  “did  comport  with  the  reasonable
understanding and expectations of the defendant as to the
sentence for which he had bargained.” Id. at 31.

Vaval,  404  F.3d  at  155-56.  In  Vaval,  however,  the  Second
Circuit Court of Appeals  *1154  found that the prosecution's
breach, which consisted of breach of a promise not to move
for  an  upward  departure  or  to  argue  where  to  sentence  the
defendant  within  his  guidelines  range,  required  a  remedy,
because  the  breached  promise  was  “unquestionably  the
centerpiece  of  the  agreement.”  Id.  at  156.  The  court  found
that, because the prosecution had violated essential provisions
of the plea agreement, and “because no specific performance
of the agreement was (or could be) granted to [the defendant]
through  a  Rule  35  proceeding,”  the  court  was  required  to
order some remedy, and the court granted resentencing before

The  Eighth  Circuit  Court  of  Appeals  has  also  held  that  no
relief from the prosecution's violation of the plea agreement
was  appropriate  where  the  sentencing  court  had  refused
to  impose  the  enhancement  for  which  the  prosecution  had
improperly  argued,  in  derogation  of  its  promises  in  a
plea  agreement.  See  E.V.,  500  F.3d  at  755.  In  E.V.,  the
prosecution's breach was introduction of firearms testimony,
despite  terms  of  a  plea  agreement  that  none  of  the  offense
characteristics  contained  in  U.S.S.G.  §  2D1.1(b),  which
includes  possession  of  a  dangerous  weapon,  including  a
firearm,  were  applicable.  Id.  at  752.  The  reason  that  no
remedy was necessary in that case was that “[t]he [district]
court  adhered  to  its  assurance  that  ‘there's  not  going  to
be  a  gun  enhancement,’  and  did  not  increase  Appellant's
base offense level pursuant to section 2D1.1 or enhance his
sentence  pursuant  to  section  5K2.6  based  on  his  alleged
possession  of  a  weapon.”  Id.  at  755.  Thus,  there  may  be
circumstances in which, notwithstanding a breach of a plea
agreement  by  the  prosecution,  the  defendant  may  not  be
entitled to any relief.

b. Dicus's entitlement to relief

[4]
  I  find  that  this  is  not  a  case  in  which  no  remedy  is
appropriate, because the prosecution's breach was not minor
or  technical.  See  Vaval,  404  F.3d  at  155-56.  Rather,  much
as in Vaval, the prosecution's argument for a career offender
enhancement was contrary to the “no other enhancements”
provision  that  was  “unquestionably  the  centerpiece  of  the
agreement.”  Id.  at  156.  Because  the  plea  agreement  was
clear, Dicus reasonably expected that the prosecution would
not seek a career offender enhancement, and that reasonable
expectation  was  not  fulfilled.  Id.  Thus,  Dicus  suffered  a
meaningful  detriment  when,  notwithstanding  the  “no  other
enhancements” provision, the prosecution expressly argued
for  a  career  offender  enhancement,  and  some  remedy  is
required.  Id.;  accord  Mosley,  505  F.3d  at  809-12  (where
there  has  been  a  breach  of  the  plea  agreement,  harmless-
error analysis does not apply, and the court must consider the
proper remedy).

U.S. v. Dicus, 579 F.Supp.2d 1142 (2008)

I  also  find  that  this  is  not  a  case  in  which  no  remedy  is
appropriate, because the sentencing court declined to impose
the  sentencing  enhancement  for  which  the  prosecution
improperly  argued,  which,  in  this  case,  was  the  then-
applicable  career  offender  enhancement,  based  on  Dicus's
1992  OWI  3rd.  See  E.V.,  500  F.3d  at  755  (no  relief
from  the  prosecution's  violation  of  the  plea  agreement  was
appropriate,  because  the  sentencing  court  had  refused  to
impose  the  enhancement  for  which  the  prosecution  had

agreement).  Here,  the  sentencing  court  did  not  save  Dicus
from the consequences of the prosecution's improper actions,
an  intervening  change  in  the  law  did.  I  agree  with  Dicus
that  the  prosecution  should  not  “get  the  benefit”  of  Begay
to save it from the consequences of its violation of the plea
*1155  agreement, because granting no relief is inappropriate
where  the  defendant  has  been  subjected  to  a  due  process
violation for which harmless-error analysis is not available.

analysis does not apply); E.V., 500 F.3d at 751 (violation of
a plea agreement violates due process).

Granting  no  relief  is  also  inappropriate,  because  it  would
do  nothing  to  deter  prosecutorialmisconduct  or  to  give
defendants  an  incentive  to  raise  prosecutorialmisconduct
claims.  See,  e.g.,  Sonja  Starr, 3 Sentence  Reduction  as  a
Remedy  for  ProsecutorialMisconduct  (hereinafter  Starr,
Sentence  Reduction  ),  2  &  n.  10  (unpublished  draft,
September  2,  2008;  used  by  permission)  (citing  Guido
Calabresi, The Exclusionary Rule, 26 HARV. J.L. & PUB.
POL'YY  111,  116-17  (2003),  and  Harry  M.  Caldwell
and  Carol  A.  Chase,  The  Unruly  Exclusionary  Rule,  78
MARQ.  L.REV..  45,  68-71  (1994),  as  suggesting  that  the
appropriate remedy for prosecutorialmisconduct should be
the combination of direct sanctions against the police, such
as  fines,  to  deter  misconduct,  with  sentence  reductions,
to  give  defendants  an  incentive  to  raise  misconduct
claims). Moreover, “[p]rosecutorialmisconduct has been a
widespread and widely criticized problem in the U.S. criminal
justice  system  for  decades,”  albeit  one  for  which  existing

remedies  are  ineffective,  “largely  because  they  are  rarely
invoked.” Id. at 4 & 1. For example, as the Second Circuit
Court  of  Appeals  observed  more  than  two  decades  ago,
“Given this Court's unwillingness to use reversals as a means
of disciplining prosecutors, threats to do so seem unlikely to
have  much  effect.  As  a  practical  matter,  prosecutors  know
that courts are reluctant to overturn convictions because of
improper [conduct].” United States v. Modica, 663 F.2d 1173,
1183  (2d  Cir.1981)  (cited  in  Starr,  Sentence  Reduction,  at
13). The problem cannot continue to go unremedied by the
courts, so that some relief from prosecutorialmisconduct is
appropriate in this case.

c. Inadequacy of the typical remedies here

Courts  have  recognized  that  there  may  be  circumstances
in  which  one  or  the  other  of  the  preferred  remedies
for  the  prosecution's  breach  of  a  plea  agreement-specific
performance  of  the  breached  provision  or  withdrawal  of
the  defendant's  guilty  plea-is  inadequate.  For  example,  the
Third  Circuit  Court  of  Appeals  has  recognized  that,  where
the  defendant  has  already  served  a  considerable  portion  of
his  sentence,  so  that  “  ‘permitting  the  withdrawal  of  his
plea would be an empty remedy,’ ” or where the defendant
sought  specific  performance  because  he  did  not  want  to
withdraw  his  guilty  plea,  the  court  should  not  impose  a
remedy  against  the  non-breaching  party's  will  or  a  remedy
that would be no remedy at all. See United States v. Williams,
510  F.3d  416,  427  (3d  Cir.2007)  (citing  United  States  v.
Badaracco,  954  F.2d  928,  941  (3d  Cir.1992),  as  the  first
example, and Nolan-Cooper, 155 F.3d at 241, as the second).
Thus,  the  Third  Circuit  Court  of  Appeals  recognized  that
an  exception  to  a  typical  remedy  was  appropriate,  “when
the circumstances dictate that there is only one appropriate
remedy  for  the  [non-breaching]  defendant,”  although  the
exception was simply to default to the other typical remedy.
Id.;  see  also  *1156 United  States  v.  VanDam,  493  F.3d
1194, 1206 (10th Cir.2007) (“Although the choice of remedy
rests  with  the  court  rather  than  the  defendant,”  the  court
would grant the defendant's request for resentencing, rather
than  requiring  him  to  withdraw  of  his  guilty  plea,  because
“[w]hen ... the defendant does not seek to withdraw his guilty
plea, the less dramatic remedy of resentencing appears to be
most apt.”).

U.S. v. Dicus, 579 F.Supp.2d 1142 (2008)

[5]
  Here,  however,  the  circumstances  are  exceptional  in
that neither of the typical remedies would provide adequate
relief. Requiring specific performance of the breached term of
the plea agreement would grant Dicus no relief whatsoever,
because,  in  the  interim  between  the  prosecution's  breach
of  the  plea  agreement  and  Dicus's  sentencing  hearing,  the
Supreme Court had mooted the issue of whether Dicus could
be subjected to the career offender enhancement he was trying
to avoid by entering into the plea agreement. See Begay, ---
U.S.  ----,  128  S.Ct.  1581  (holding  that  a  felony  offense  of
driving while under the influence of alcohol is not a “violent
felony”  within  the  meaning  of  the  Armed  Career  Criminal
Act); Heikes, 525 F.3d at 664 (recognizing that the decision
in Begay means that a felony offense of driving while under
the  influence  of  alcohol  cannot  be  the  basis  for  a  career
offender  sentencing  enhancement  pursuant  to  U.S.S.G.  §
4B1.1). Similarly, granting Dicus the opportunity to withdraw
his  guilty  plea  would  likely  result  in  prejudice  to  Dicus,
rather than any relief from the prosecution's misconduct, as he
would have to commence the whole process anew, admittedly
without  any  possibility  of  a  career  offender  enhancement,
but equally without any assurance that the prosecution will
not  contest  his  adjusted  offense  level  of  25.  Under  these
circumstances, it is inappropriate to foist upon the defendant
a  “remedy”  of  allowing  him  to  withdraw  his  guilty  plea,
because  he  does  not  seek  such  a  remedy,  even  if  specific
performance  of  the  breached  term  of  the  plea  agreement
would  provide  him  with  no  relief.  Cf.  Williams,  510  F.3d
at  427  (holding  that  the  court  should  not  impose  a  remedy
against the non-breaching party's will, so that the defendant,
who  did  not  want  to  withdraw  his  guilty  plea,  should  be
resentenced  pursuant  to  the  terms  of  the  breached  plea
agreement). Thus, in this case, the recognized remedies for the
prosecution's breach of the plea agreement provide no relief
at all. The question is, what remedies are available in such
circumstances?

d. The “touchstones” for the appropriate remedy

Although  the  Eighth  Circuit  Court  of  Appeals,  like  other
courts, has explicitly recognized only the typical remedies of
specific performance or withdrawal of a guilty plea for the
prosecution's breach of a plea agreement, the Eighth Circuit
Court of Appeals has recognized that “the determination of
the appropriate remedy is typically left to the discretion of the

court,” and that enforcement of the agreement and withdrawal
of  the  guilty  plea  are  “[a]mong  the  options  available  to
the  court.”  United  States  v.  Fowler,  445  F.3d  1035,  1038
(8th Cir.2006) (emphasis added); see also E.V., 500 F.3d at
754 (“When the government breaches a plea agreement, ‘the
defendant  is  typically  given  the  option  of  withdrawing  his
guilty plea or demanding specific performance.’ ”) (emphasis
added) (quoting Goings, 200 F.3d at 544). 4  This language
appears to me to recognize that, in appropriate circumstances,
*1157  the court can consider sanctions for the prosecution's
breach of a plea agreement beyond the recognized remedies
of ordering specific performance of the breached provision or
allowing the defendant to withdraw his guilty plea.

Similarly,  as  I  read  the  Supreme  Court's  decision  in
Santobello, that case does not stand for the proposition that
specific  performance  or  withdrawal  of  a  guilty  plea  are
necessarily the only remedies available for the prosecution's
violation  of  a  plea  agreement,  even  though  those  were  the
only  two  remedies  expressly  discussed  in  that  case.  See
Santobello, 404 U.S. at 262-63, 92 S.Ct. 495. In remanding
the  case  to  the  state  court  to  determine,  in  its  discretion,
which remedy was appropriate, the Supreme Court explained
that  its  concern  was  to  best  serve  “the  interests  of  justice
and appropriate recognition of the duties of the prosecution
in  relation  to  promises  made  in  the  negotiation  of  pleas
of  guilty.”  Id.  I  believe  that  the  “interests  of  justice”  and
“appropriate recognition of the duties of the prosecution in
relation  to  promises  made  in  the  negotiation  of  pleas  of
guilty,” therefore, should be the “touchstones” in determining
the appropriate remedy for the prosecution's breach of a plea
agreement.

I  also  believe  that  a  wider  range  of  remedies  should  be
considered,  in  appropriate  cases,  because  breach  of  a  plea
agreement  is  a  due  process  violation  that  is  sufficiently
serious that “harmless-error analysis does not apply.” Mosley,
505  F.3d  at  810;see  also  id.  at  812(Santobello  holds  that
harmless-error  analysis  does  not  apply).  If  the  typical
remedies provide no relief, then failing to award any other
relief suggests, in effect, that there has been no harm from
the  breach  to  be  remedied,  and  the  absence  of  other  relief
denigrates  the  due  process  right  that  has  been  violated.
Santobello,  404  U.S.  at  257,  92  S.Ct.  495  (allowing  the
government  to  breach  a  promise  that  induced  a  guilty  plea
violates due process); Sanchez, 508 F.3d at 460 (“Due process

a  guilty  plea.”);  E.V.,  500  F.3d  at  751  (violation  of  a  plea
agreement violates due process).

e. The appropriate remedy here

Here,  using  what  I  find  from  Santobello  to  be  the
“touchstones” for determination of the appropriate relief for
the prosecution's breach of a plea agreement, I cannot find
that  the  “interests  of  justice”  or  “appropriate  recognition
of  the  duties  of  the  prosecution  in  relation  to  promises
made in the negotiation of pleas of guilty,” Santobello, 404
U.S.  at  262-63,  92  S.Ct.  495,  will  be  served  by  according
Dicus  no  relief  on  the  ground  that  he  has  obtained  what
he sought in the plea agreement's “no other enhancements”
provision. It is true that Dicus obtained what he sought in the
plea agreement-avoidance of a career offender enhancement
pursuant  to  U.S.S.G.  §  4B1.1  because  of  his  1992  OWI
3rd  conviction-but  because  of  an  intervening  change  in
the  law  wrought  by  Begay,  ---  U.S.  ----,  128  S.Ct.  1581.
The situation might be different, if Dicus had already been
sentenced, and the sentencing court had declined to impose
the  then-applicable  career  offender  enhancement,  based  on
Dicus's  1992  OWI  3rd,  notwithstanding  the  prosecution's
improper  argument  for  such  an  enhancement  in  derogation
of its promises in the plea agreement. See E.V., 500 F.3d at
755  (no  relief  from  the  prosecution's  violation  of  the  plea
agreement was appropriate, because the sentencing court had
refused to impose the enhancement for which the prosecution
had  improperly  argued,  in  derogation  of  its  promises  in  a
plea agreement). Here, however, I agree with Dicus that the
prosecution should not “get the benefit” of Begay to save it
from the consequences of its violation of the plea agreement,
because granting no relief in these circumstances simply will
not recognize  *1158  the duties of the prosecution in relation
to promises made in the negotiation of pleas of guilty.

The  situation  also  might  be  different,  if  the  prosecution's
violation of the plea agreement had been less egregious, but
it was egregious, and thus, undermined the whole system of
trust  upon  which  plea  negotiations  must  be  based.  Again,
granting no relief in these circumstances will not recognize
the  duties  of  the  prosecution  in  relation  to  promises  made
in  the  negotiation  of  pleas  of  guilty,  nor  will  it  serve  the
interests of justice, which are best served by granting relief

from egregious misconduct. Moreover, as I mentioned above,
the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District
of Iowa is a “repeat offender,” where just before the breach
of  the  plea  agreement  occurred  in  this  case,  the  Eighth
Circuit  Court  of  Appeals  had  held  that,  in  another  case
before Chief Judge Reade, the United States Attorney's Office
for  the  Northern  District  of  Iowa  had  also  breached  a  plea
agreement by seeking sentencing determinations contrary to
stipulations in the plea agreement. See Mosley, 505 F.3d at
808-09 (handed down October 12, 2007, just over a month
before the prosecution filed its sentencing memorandum in
this  case  on  November  21,  2007,  in  which  the  prosecution
sought application of the career offender sentencing provision
contrary  to  the  stipulations  in  the  plea  agreement).  Both
the  interests  of  justice  and  recognition  of  the  duties  of  the
prosecution in relation to promises made in the negotiation of
pleas of guilty require a response to the repeated misconduct
of  the  United  States  Attorney's  Office  for  the  Northern
District of Iowa.

Under  the  circumstances  of  this  case,  I  believe  that  an
appropriate remedy for the prosecution's misconduct-that is,
a remedy that serves both the “interests of justice” and shows
“appropriate  recognition  of  the  duties  of  the  prosecution
in  relation  to  promises  made  in  the  negotiation  of  pleas
of  guilty,”  Santobello,  404  U.S.  at  262-63,  92  S.Ct.  495-is
to  reduce  Dicus's  sentence  to  the  low  end  of  his  advisory
sentencing guidelines range. This is so, notwithstanding that,
in  the  absence  of  such  prosecutorialmisconduct,  I  would
very likely have sentenced Dicus at the top end of the range
based on his repeated sales of marijuana to minors. I find that
such a remedy is appropriate, because it is likely to have a
deterrent effect on prosecutorialmisconduct, to provide an
incentive  to  defendants  to  raise  misconduct  claims,  and  to
serve other salutary goals. 5

*1159   First,  precisely  because  this  remedy  provides  a
tangible consequence for the prosecution's misconduct, which
the  usual  remedies  for  breach  of  a  plea  agreement  do  not
in  this  case,  this  remedy  serves  the  interests  of  justice  by
reinforcing  that  there  must  be  consequences  for  violation
of  a  defendant's  due  process  rights,  and  the  remedy  also
relates  directly  to  the  prosecution's  duties  in  relation  to
promises made in the negotiation of pleas of guilty, because
it  recognizes  that  the  prosecution's  breached  promise  was
an  inducement  to  the  defendant's  guilty  plea.  Santobello,

U.S. v. Dicus, 579 F.Supp.2d 1142 (2008)

404  U.S.  at  262-63,  92  S.Ct.  495  (identifying  the  interests
that  the  proper  remedy  should  serve).  “Most  scholars
have  assumed  that  prosecutors  generally  prefer  higher
sentences, and the existing empirical evidence supports that
conclusion.” Starr, Sentence Reduction, at 23 (citing Stephen
F. Smith, Proportionality and Federalization, 91 VA. L.REV.
879,  (2005)  879,  896,  928  (2005);  Jeffrey  Standen,  Plea
Bargaining in the Shadow of the Guidelines, 81 CAL. L.REV.
1471, 1480 (1993); and Albert Altschuler, Prosecutor's Role
in  Plea  Bargaining,  36  U.  CHI.  L.REV..  50,  52  (1968)).
Indeed,  my  own  experience  over  fourteen  years  and  the
sentencing of over 2,600 defendants does nothing to suggest
that  the  assumption  that  prosecutors  in  this  District  prefer
higher sentences is wrong. Thus, a sentence reduction is likely
to  be  an  effective  deterrent  to  prosecutorialmisconduct.
There  is  also  a  symmetry  to  such  a  remedy,  which  grants
a defendant a sentence reduction for the prosecution's post-
plea misconduct, where the United States Sentencing  *1160
Guidelines are replete with provisions that impose a sentence
increase  upon  a  defendant  for  his  post-plea  misconduct.
Indeed,  the  United  States  Attorney's  Office  in  this  District
frequently  attempts  to  increase  a  defendant's  sentence  for
alleged post-plea misconduct. In answer to the suggestion that
such a sanction visits upon the client, the United States, the
sins of the attorney, whereas the Sentencing Guidelines visit
upon the client the consequences of his own misconduct, I
would respond that I am sanctioning egregious conduct by an
Assistant United States Attorney in his official capacity and,
in that respect, I am sanctioning conduct that is conduct by
the executive branch of the United States. No other sanction
would be a deterrent to official misconduct, because a fine
against  the  prosecutor  personally  would  inflict  a  private
sanction for official misconduct, and a fine against the United
States would be no deterrent at all, no matter how large.

Second,  such  a  remedy  provides  an  important  incentive  to
defendants to raise issues of prosecutorialmisconduct. Cf.
Starr, Sentence Reduction, at 2 & n. 10 (citing commentators
who  have  suggested  that  the  appropriate  remedy  is  a
combination  of  sanctions,  including  sentence  reductions,
to  deter  misconduct  and  to  give  defendants  an  incentive
to  raise  misconduct  claims).  This  is  so,  because,  just  as
a  sentence  reduction  provides  a  tangible  consequence  for
the  prosecution's  misconduct,  it  provides  a  tangible  benefit
to  the  wronged  defendant.  Such  a  remedy  also  serves  the
interests of justice by vindicating the defendant's due process
rights  in  a  way  that  relates  directly  to  the  prosecution's

duties  in  relation  to  promises  made  in  the  negotiation  of
pleas  of  guilty,  where  such  a  remedy  recognizes  that  the
prosecution's  breached  promise  was  an  inducement  to  the
defendant's  guilty  plea.  Santobello,  404  U.S.  at  262-63,  92
S.Ct.  495  (identifying  the  interests  that  the  proper  remedy
should serve). Even in cases in which a defendant may have
some incentive to assert prosecutorialmisconduct, it is rare
that the defendant's counsel does not have some disincentives
for  asserting  such  a  claim  arising  from  the  possibility  of
friction  in  future  relations  with  the  prosecutor's  office  in
question, which could result in a detriment to other clients.
This  case  was  unique  in  that  Dicus's  sentencing  hearing
was defense counsel's last appearance in a federal criminal
case before retiring, after thirty-two years of very impressive
service to the legal profession, so that defense counsel was
in  the  unique  and  unusual  position  of  having  nothing  to
fear  for  future  clients  from  arguing  for  some  relief  for
Dicus from prosecutorialmisconduct in his case. Thus, the
availability of a remedy that is less disruptive than withdrawal
of  a  guilty  plea  may  help  to  overcome  the  disincentives
that defense counsel may otherwise face to raising a claim
of  prosecutorialmisconduct,  at  the  same  time  that  the
availability  of  such  a  remedy  may  increase  the  incentives
for  defendants  to  raise  such  claims  and  may  increase  the
incentives  for  courts  to  sanction  such  misconduct,  for  the
reasons explained just below.

Third,  such  a  remedy  not  only  avoids  the  inadequacies
of  the  typical  remedies,  it  avoids  a  remedy  that  would
appear  to  be  “excessive”  or  a  “windfall”  to  the  defendant,
such  as  dismissal  of  the  indictment,  thereby  removing
one  explanation  for  the  failure  of  courts  to  respond  to
prosecutorialmisconduct. As Professor Starr has observed,

them  as

Current 
remedies

strikingly ineffective, largely because
courts  view 
too  costly
to  grant.  Scholars  too  often  have
been  unrealistic  about  this  remedial

when 
the  more  realistic  solution
might  be  nominally  “weaker”  ones.

U.S. v. Dicus, 579 F.Supp.2d 1142 (2008)

condemn  prosecutorialmisconduct,
while  avoiding  the  social  costs  of
retrial and providing a fair measure of
relief to defendants whose rights have
been violated.

Starr, Sentence Reduction at 55. Thus, a sentence reduction
may  be  more  palatable  for  the  court  to  impose  than
other, more typical remedies for prosecutorialmisconduct.
Moreover,  in  this  case,  a  sentence  reduction  is  more
appropriate, in my view, than foisting withdrawal of his plea
on Dicus, which he does not want and which could work to
his detriment, or doing nothing, because specific performance
is no longer an option. Cf. Williams, 510 F.3d at 427 (holding
that the court should not impose a remedy against the non-
breaching party's will, so that the defendant, who did not want
to withdraw his guilty plea, should be resentenced pursuant
to the terms of the breached plea agreement).

Finally,  the  interests  of  justice  from  a  public  perspective
are  also  served  by  imposing  a  sentence  reduction  as
a  sanction  for  the  prosecution's  violation  of  a  plea
agreement,  where,  as  here,  notwithstanding  the  reduction
for  prosecutorialmisconduct,  the  sentence  imposed  still
falls within the advisory guidelines range and is, therefore,
presumptively  reasonable  on  appeal.  See  Rita  v.  United
States,  551  U.S.  338,  127  S.Ct.  2456,  2465,  168  L.Ed.2d
203  (2007);  Gall  v.  United  States,  552  U.S.  38,  ----,  128
S.Ct.  586,  597,  169  L.Ed.2d  445  (2007);  United  States  v.
Whiting, 522 F.3d 845, 849 (8th Cir.2008). 6  The interests of
justice from both the defendant's and the public's perspective
are  also  served,  where,  for  the  reasons  explained  below,
the  reduced  sentence  imposed  as  a  sanction  still  serves
the  purposes  of  sentencing  without  regard  to  remedying
prosecutorialmisconduct.

Therefore, as a sanction for the prosecution's violation of the
plea agreement in this case, I sentence Dicus to 70 months
imprisonment, the low end of his advisory guidelines range.

C. Reasonableness Of The Resulting Sentence

[6]
  Because  I  have  reduced  Dicus's  sentence  as  a
sanction  for  prosecutorialmisconduct,  I  must  determine
whether  the  resulting  sentence  in  this  case,  as  in  any

other  case  not  involving  such  a  sanction,  still  serves
the  purposes  of  sentencing,  without  regard  to  remedying
prosecutorialmisconduct. As explained above, there are no
remaining  objections  to  the  calculation  of  Dicus's  advisory
guidelines range. Thus, the focus is the reasonableness of the
sentence that I have ultimately imposed, after calculation of
Dicus's advisory guidelines range.

1. The “reasonableness” analysis
As  the  Eighth  Circuit  Court  of  Appeals  very  recently
reiterated,

review 

the 

imposed 

sentence 

*1162   We 
for
reasonableness,  first  “ensur[ing]  that  the  district  court
committed no significant procedural error.” Gall v. United
States, 552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445
(2007); see also Whiting, 522 F.3d at 849. If the district
court's  decision  is  “procedurally  sound,”  we  proceed
to  review  the  sentence  for  substantive  reasonableness
under  an  abuse  of  discretion  standard.  Gall,  128  S.Ct.
at  597;Whiting,  522  F.3d  at  849.  We  may  apply  a
presumption  of  reasonableness  to  a  sentence  within  the
properly  calculated  guideline  range  but  are  not  required
to  do  so.  See  Rita  v.  United  States,  551  U.S.  338,  127
S.Ct. 2456, 2465, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007); Gall, 128 S.Ct.
at 597;Whiting, 522 F.3d at 849. In imposing a sentence
under 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a), a sentencing court abuses its
discretion if “it fails to consider a relevant factor that should
have received significant weight, gives significant weight
to an improper or irrelevant factor, or considers only the
appropriate factors but commits a clear error of judgment
in weighing those factors.” United States v. Watson, 480
F.3d 1175, 1177 (8th Cir.2007).

United States v. Brown, 539 F.3d 835, 841-42 (8th Cir.2008).
As the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals has also explained, “
‘Substantive sentencing acts include, most importantly, how
a district court balances the § 3553(a) sentencing factors to
derive its sentence.’ ” United States v. Saddler, 538 F.3d 879,
889 (8th Cir.2008) (quoting United States v. Tabor, 531 F.3d
688, 691 (8th Cir.2008)).

2. The balance of the § 3553(a) factors
Section 3553(a) of Title 18 provides that “[t]he court shall

this subsection,” giving consideration to various enumerated
factors. 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a). After considering the balance of
the pertinent § 3553(a) factors, see Saddler, 538 F.3d at 889
(such  balance  is  the  most  important  substantive  sentencing
act),  I  find  that  a  70-month  sentence  is  appropriate.  In
particular,  such  a  sentence  is  appropriate  in  light  of  “the
nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and
characteristics  of  the  defendant,”  18  U.S.C.  §  3553(a)(1),
including  prior  convictions,  which  fully  justify  a  sentence
within  the  advisory  guidelines  range;  “the  need  for  the
sentence imposed,” 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2), which here arises
in large part from the extent and frequency of the defendant's
illegal conduct; “the kinds of sentences available,” 18 U.S.C.
§ 3553(a)(3); “the kinds of sentence and the sentencing range
established  for”  Dicus's  offenses,  18  U.S.C.  §  3553(a)(4)
(A); pertinent policy statements, 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(5); and
“the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among
defendants with similar records who have been found guilty
of  similar  conduct,”  including  in  this  case  Dicus's  wife,
who received a 48-month sentence in this case, 18 U.S.C. §
3553(a)(6).

in 

that 

the  alternative,  I  believe 

Indeed,  albeit 
the
prosecution's  breach  of  a  plea  agreement  may  properly
be  considered  as  a  §  3553(a)  factor  in  determining  the
defendant's sentence. This is so, because § 3553(a)(1) requires
the  court  to  consider,  inter  alia,  the  defendant's  “history.”
18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(1). The defendant's post-plea “history”
presumably  includes  not  only  his  own  conduct,  but  the
conduct  of  the  prosecution  toward  him.  In  other  words,
wrongs done to the defendant post-plea seem to me to be just
as  relevant  to  determination  of  the  defendant's  sentence  as
any wrongs done by the defendant post-plea. For that reason,
I  believe  that  I  could  properly  consider  the  prosecution's
*1163  breach of the defendant's plea agreement as part of
his  “history”  pursuant  to  §  3553(a)(1)  in  determining  the
appropriate sentence.

More specifically, as to the purposes set forth in subsection
(2), I find that a sentence of 70 months is sufficient, but not
greater  than  necessary,  to  reflect  the  seriousness  of  and  to
provide just punishment for Dicus's offenses of conspiracy to
distribute and to possess with intent to distribute marijuana
within 1,000 feet of a playground in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§
841(a)(1), 846, and 860 in Count 1, and being an unlawful
user of marijuana and a felon in possession of ammunition in
violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 922(g)(1), 922(g)(3), and 924(a)(2),

in Count 5, and also sufficient to promote respect for the law,
because the term of imprisonment is far from insignificant in
comparison to the crimes to which Dicus has pleaded guilty.
See18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2)(A). I also find that such a sentence
will  afford  adequate  deterrence  to  criminal  conduct,  again,
because it is far from insignificant in comparison to the crimes
to which Dicus has pleaded guilty. See18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2)
(B). Next, I find that such a sentence will protect the public
from further crimes of the defendant, not only because of the
length of his incarceration, but because of the opportunity that
the term of imprisonment will provide for him to obtain drug
treatment and to work toward rehabilitation. See18 U.S.C. §
3553(a)(2)(C).  Finally,  I  find  such  a  sentence  will  provide
Dicus with needed educational or vocational training, medical
care, or other correctional treatment, including the 500-hour
residential  drug  treatment  program,  in  the  most  effective
manner. See18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2)(D).

Thus, I reiterate my conclusion that a sentence of 70 months
imprisonment is reasonable in this case.

III. CONCLUSION

In this case, I find that a reduction in the defendant's sentence,
albeit  one  to  the  low  end  of  his  advisory  guidelines  range,
when  I  would  otherwise  have  sentenced  him  to  the  high
end, is the appropriate remedy for the prosecution's serious
violation of the defendant's plea agreement. Such a remedy
provides both deterrence for the prosecution's misconduct and
an  incentive  to  defendants  to  raise  such  misconduct.  Such
a  remedy  also  serves  the  “interests  of  justice”  and  shows
“appropriate recognition of the duties of the prosecution in
relation  to  promises  made  in  the  negotiation  of  pleas  of
guilty.” Santobello, 404 U.S. at 262-63, 92 S.Ct. 495. Finally,
the  reduced  sentence  in  this  case  still  serves  the  purposes
of sentencing, upon consideration of the pertinent § 3553(a)
factors, in that it is sufficient, but no greater than necessary,
to achieve all of the appropriate sentencing purposes.

THEREFORE,  I  reiterate  my  conclusion  at  the  September
9,  2008,  sentencing  hearing  that  defendant  David  Dicus
should be sentenced to 70 months imprisonment, the low end
of  his  advisory  guidelines  sentencing  range,  as  a  sanction
for  the  prosecution's  serious  and  recidivist  violation  of  the
defendant's plea agreement.

Tami Dicus, Dicus's wife, was charged as a co-defendant on Counts 1, 3, and 4, and as the sole defendant on Count 2,
which charged her with distribution of marijuana to a person under the age of twenty-one within 1,000 feet of a playground
in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1), 859, and 860.
Nor are these the only two incidents of serious prosecutorialmisconduct in this District during my tenure as a United
States District Court Judge. Although there are other examples of serious prosecutorialmisconduct in this District, it is
not necessary to catalogue them for purposes of the present ruling.
Sonja Starr is an Assistant Professor at the University of Maryland School of Law.
Admittedly, in E.V., the court departed from these “typical” remedies by not granting any relief, because it was “ ‘clear
beyond doubt’ that the government's breach did not impact Appellant's sentence.” E.V., 500 F.3d at 755 (quoting Goings,
200 F.3d at 544). Even so, E.V. suggests that “atypical” remedies may be available.
I note Professor Starr's observation that “[s]entence reduction is an accepted remedy in a number of jurisdictions for a
variety of kinds of violations of criminal defendants' rights,” having been approved, for example, by “the European Court of
Human Rights, some European domestic courts, several Canadian provincial supreme courts, and the Appeals Chamber
of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda,” although it is “essentially unknown in U.S. courts.” Starr, Sentence
Reduction, at 1. I also note, however, that reference to foreign law has been a controversial issue of late. See, e.g.,
David S. Law, Globalization and the Future of Constitutional Rights, 102 NW. U.L.REV. 1277, 1279-80 (2008) (noting
that there “has been a torrential outpouring of literature on the propriety of judicial citation to foreign law, prompted by
the Supreme Court's use of foreign authority in a recent string of controversial cases,” and citing numerous examples);
Mark Tushnet, When is Knowing Less Better Than Knowing More?: Unpacking the Controversy Over Supreme Court
Reference to Non-U.S. Law, 90 Minn. L.Rev. 1275, 1276 (2006) (noting this controversy). The fiery debate over the issue
has engaged even United States Supreme Court Justices. Compare Confirmation Hearing on the Nomination of Samuel
Alito to the United States Supreme Court, 2006 WL 53273 (“I don't think that we should look to foreign law to interpret
our own Constitution. I agree with you that the laws of the United States consist of the Constitution and treaties and laws
and, I would add, regulations that are promulgated in accordance with law. And I don't think that it's appropriate or useful
to look to foreign law in interpreting the provisions of our Constitution. I think the framers would be stunned by the idea
that the Bill of Rights is to be interpreted by taking a poll of the countries of the world.”); Confirmation Hearing on the
Nomination of John G. Roberts, Jr., to be Chief Justice of the United States Before the S. Comm. on the Judiciary, 109th
Cong. 200, 200-01 (2005) (Statement of then Judge Roberts) (“In foreign law you can find anything you want. If you don't
find it in the decisions of France or Italy, it's in the decisions of Somalia or Japan or Indonesia or wherever. As somebody
said in another context, looking at foreign law for support is like looking out over a crowd and picking out your friends. You
can find them, they're there. And that actually expands the discretion of the judge. It allows the judge to incorporate his
or her own personal preferences, cloak them with the authority of precedent because they're finding precedent in foreign
law, and use that to determine the meaning of the Constitution. I think that's a misuse of precedent, not a correct use of
precedent.”); with Roper v. Simmons, 543 U.S. 551, 578, 125 S.Ct. 1183, 161 L.Ed.2d 1 (2005) (Kennedy, J., writing for the
majority) (“The opinion of the world community, while not controlling our outcome, does provide respected and significant
confirmation for our own conclusions.”); Ruth Bader Ginsburg, “A decent Respect to the Opinions of [Human]kind”: The
Value of a Comparative Perspective in Constitutional Adjudication, Constitutional Court of South Africa (Feb. 7, 2006)
(reprinted at http://supremecourtus. gov/publicinfo/speeches/sp_02-07b-06.html) (“Foreign opinions are not authoritative;
they set no binding precedent for the U.S. judge. But they can add to the store of knowledge relevant to the solution of
trying questions. Yes, we should approach foreign legal materials with sensitivity to our differences, deficiencies, and
imperfect understanding, but imperfection, I believe, should not lead us to abandon the effort to learn what we can from
the experience and good thinking foreign sources may convey.”). I also note that, as a controversy rages in the United
States concerning citation of foreign law, United States decisions have recently been cited less often by foreign courts.
See, e.g., United States Court Is Now Guiding Fewer Nations, N.Y. TIMES (Sept. 17, 2008) (online edition at http://
www.nytimes.com/2008/09/18/us/18legal.html? r=2&hp&oref=slogin&oref=slogin). I add that I am not relying on foreign

law sources suggesting reduction of a defendant's sentence as a sanction for prosecutorialmisconduct to support this
opinion.
I take no position, in this case, on whether still more egregious or malicious prosecutorialmisconduct, or circumstances
in which the defendant's conduct did not otherwise justify sentencing him at the top of the advisory guidelines range,
might  justify  reduction  of  a  sentence  below  the  low  end  of  the  advisory  guidelines  range  as  a  sanction  for  serious
prosecutorialmisconduct. However, I do not mean to suggest that the low end of the advisory guidelines range is the
lower limit for a sentence reduction as a sanction for serious prosecutorialmisconduct. For example, even a high-end
or mid-range guidelines sentence could be reduced below the low end for serious prosecutorialmisconduct, so long as
the ultimate sentence was sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to achieve all of the purposes of federal sentencing.
Also, even in this case, had I not chosen the high end of the advisory guidelines range to start with, the rationale of
this opinion would suggest that a sentence reduction for serious prosecutorialmisconduct could have resulted in a
sentence below the bottom of the advisory guidelines range.

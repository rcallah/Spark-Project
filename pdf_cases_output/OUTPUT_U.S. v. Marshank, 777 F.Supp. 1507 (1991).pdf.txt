On  July  26,  1990,  defendant  Steven  M.  Marshank  and
two  co-defendants  were  indicted  and  charged  with  federal
statutory  violations  related  to  their  alleged  membership  in
an  organization  which  imported  large  amounts  of  hashish
and marijuana into the United States. 1  Marshank brings this
motion to dismiss the indictment against him, alleging that

right  to  due  process.  Specifically,  Marshank  alleges  that

U.S. v. Marshank, 777 F.Supp. 1507 (1991)

Ronald Minkin, had an ongoing relationship with government
agents  from  various  federal  law  enforcement  agencies  and
the  Assistant  United  States  Attorneys  (“AUSA”)  assigned
to  his  case.  Marshank  alleges  that  these  agents  and
AUSAs,  with  full  knowledge  that  Minkin  was  defendant's
attorney, encouraged Minkin to actively aid the government's
investigation  of  the  defendant.  Marshank  further  maintains
that the government exploited the information they received
from  Minkin  to  arrest  and  prosecute  him.  This  complicity,
Marshank  contends,  occurred  throughout  the  course  of  the
investigation  which  led  to  a  1987  indictment  of  defendant,
subsequently  dismissed  by  the  government,  and  continued
during the investigation leading to the instant indictment.

After reviewing the arguments and submissions of the parties,
the court found that further evidence was necessary in order to
rule on the motion to dismiss and held an evidentiary hearing
pursuant  to  Federal  Rule  of  Evidence  611.  The  following
witnesses  testified  at  the  hearing:  1)  Ronald  Minkin,  the
defendant's  former  attorney;  2)  Peter  Robinson,  the  AUSA
assigned to defendant's case in 1987; 3) Lee C. Rasmussen,
an  F.B.I.  agent  who  worked  in  the  narcotics  unit  of  the
Organized Crime Division in Los Angeles from 1982 through
January  1990; 2   4)  Edward  Ames,  a  U.S.  Customs  agent
in  San  Francisco;  5)  Seth  R.  Booky,  a  former  associate  of
Marshank who was indicted for drug trafficking in 1987; 3
6) Robert Heng, a special agent with the Drug Enforcement
Administration; and 7) Wayne N. Yamashita, a special agent
with the U.S. Customs Service in San Francisco. 4

In addition to the parties' moving papers and the testimony
presented  at  the  hearing,  *1512   the  agents  submitted
declarations.  The  government,  pursuant  to  the  court's
discovery order, turned over numerous documents, including
internal  agency  memoranda,  agents'  notes  of  meetings
among themselves and with Minkin, and notes of telephone
conversations between various agents and Minkin.

FINDINGS OF FACT
Taken together, the hearing testimony, the discovery material
and  the  parties'  moving  papers  tell  the  shocking  tale
of  a  criminal  defense  attorney  who  was  oblivious  to
the  professional  norms  of  ethical  behavior  and  a  cast
of  overzealous  government  agents  and  prosecutors  who
facilitated  the  attorney's  unethical  conduct  in  an  attempt

to  catch  “a  big  fish.”  Most  of  the  facts  are  substantially
undisputed; some of them are in sharp dispute. The following
narrative embodies the court's findings of fact.

The  story  began  in  1986  when  Ronald  Minkin,  a  criminal
defense  attorney,  approached  AUSA  James  Walsh  in  Los
Angeles on behalf of two clients, Gary Crawford and Gary
Ohlgart.  Although  Crawford  and  Ohlgart  had  never  been
indicted and were not at that time under investigation, they
wished  to  dissociate  themselves  from  the  drug  business  by
providing  information  to  the  government  in  exchange  for
immunity  from  prosecution,  complete  anonymity  and  the
promise that they would never have to testify in court. RT at
1–24. Minkin arranged a deal under these terms, on behalf of
Crawford and Ohlgart, with AUSA James Walsh. Def.Ex. A.

In  August  1986  several  agents,  including  F.B.I.  agent  Lee
Rasmussen, debriefed Crawford and Ohlgart in Los Angeles.
RT  at  2–399.  Minkin  was  present  at  this  meeting.  RT
at  2–399–400.  Crawford,  Ohlgart  and  Minkin  provided
information about suspects in a major marijuana and hashish
smuggling operation. RT at 2–402. Those suspects included
several of Minkin's former and present clients, among them
Stephen Marshank, Seth Booky, and Robert Wehe. Minkin's
Los Angeles law firm had represented Marshank in a divorce
proceeding  in  1982  and  1983,  Def.Ex.  Z,  and  Minkin
had  personally  represented  Seth  Booky  on  a  drug-related
charge  in  Hawaii  in  1983.  RT  at  3–660.  Both  Marshank
and  Booky  had  ongoing  attorney-client  relationships  with
Minkin.  Minkin,  Crawford  and  Ohlgart  made  a  diagram
which  sketched  out  the  relationships  among  the  various
individuals they named. The defendant's name appeared on
the chart, which came to be known as “the matrix.” Def.Ex. 1.

On  February  5  and  6,  1987,  another  meeting  was  held
in  Los  Angeles.  This  meeting  was  attended  by  members
of  the  Organized  Crime  Drug  Enforcement  Task  Force
(“OCDETF”),  DEA  agents,  United  States  Customs  agents
from  San  Francisco  and  Los  Angeles  and  three  Assistant
United States Attorneys. A task force was formed to develop
a plan of action which would lead to the indictment of Booky,
and  then  with  Booky's  cooperation,  to  the  indictment  of
Marshank. The task force included various agents from Los
Angeles and San Francisco, including Ames and Rasmussen.
Def.Ex. P; RT at 2–416. It was determined at this meeting
that because Crawford and Ohlgart had been promised that
they would not have to testify, an “inside individual” would

be needed for the government to pursue the plan. RT at 2–
404–05.

The agents initially decided to target Robert Wehe, who was
already  the  subject  of  a  sealed  indictment,  for  the  “inside
individual” role. RT at 2–405. Ron Minkin had represented
Wehe in the past, id., and Wehe was chosen because Minkin
told the agents that he [Minkin] could “bring him in.” RT at
2–412. Minkin contacted Wehe and mediated an agreement
between Wehe and the government in which Wehe agreed to
surrender and cooperate with the government. Def.Ex. D at 2.
After his arrest while represented by Minkin, Wehe provided
information about the defendant to the government. RT at 3–
578.

It eventually became apparent to the government that Wehe
had a drinking problem which made him an unreliable active
informant.  RT  at  2–420.  The  government  then  shifted  its
focus to Seth Booky, another of Minkin's former clients who
had  *1513  been named by Minkin, Crawford and Ohlgart.
The  plan  was  to  indict  Booky  on  a  historical  conspiracy
charge. RT at 2–419. Booky would then cooperate with the
government, “wear a wire, make telephone calls and provide
the  necessary  ‘active’  work  based  upon  the  intelligence
information” provided by Crawford and Ohlgart. Def.Ex. P
at  2.  Marshank  would  be  one  of  the  major  targets  of  the
investigation. Def.Ex. P at 2; RT at 2–315, 2–425, 3–583.

Minkin  informed  the  government  agents  that  he  had
represented Booky in Hawaii in 1983 and that Booky would
be  likely  to  cooperate.  RT  at  2–419–21.  The  plan  to  elicit
Booky's cooperation in exchange for a plea agreement, RT at
2–421–22, changed in May 1987 when Minkin called Agent
Ames and informed him that Booky was involved in a large
marijuana deal. RT at 3–562. Ames testified that at the time
he received the telephone call from Minkin he was aware that
Minkin had represented Booky in the past. RT at 3–562.

Based  upon  Minkin's 
information,  AUSA  Robinson
authorized  the  arrest  of  Booky.  On  Memorial  Day  1987,
Agent  Ames  and  the  Sonoma  County  Sheriff's  Department
arrested nine individuals, including Booky, for the sale of one
thousand five hundred pounds of marijuana. Ames Decl. at
6. Agent Ames never informed Booky that Minkin was the
person  who  provided  the  government  with  the  information
leading to his arrest. RT at 3–565.

Although there are some inconsistencies in the testimony of
the various witnesses, it is clear that prior to Booky's arrest
the  government  agents  and  the  AUSAs  on  the  case  were
aware  that  Minkin  had  represented  Booky  in  the  past  and
would probably represent him after he was arrested. AUSA
Robinson, for example, stated that he “understood from Ames
that Minkin had represented Seth Booky in the past and would
likely  initially  represent  Booky”  after  his  arrest.  Robinson
Decl.  ¶  8.  Booky  himself  had  considered  Minkin  to  be  his
attorney since 1983. RT at 3–686.

The  government  also  knew  that  Minkin  had  provided  the
information  that  led  to  Booky's  arrest  either  directly  or  by
relaying information from Crawford and Ohlgart. RT at 3–
586.  While  AUSA  Robinson  denies  that  he  knew  at  the
time that the information leading to the arrest of Booky had
been supplied by Booky's own lawyer, he concedes that he
was aware that incriminating information concerning Booky
had come from Crawford and Ohlgart, whom he knew were
represented by Minkin. RT at 2–277. Robinson admits that he
was aware that this situation represented a serious conflict of
interest. RT at 2–278–79. Agent Ames testified that he told
Robinson at the time of Booky's arrest that he [Ames] had
received  the  information  leading  to  Booky's  arrest  directly
from Minkin. RT at 3–586. 5

After  Booky's  arrest,  Robinson  and  Ames  met  with  Booky
in  the  Marin  County  Jail.  The  agents  told  him  that  they
were  willing  to  work  out  a  deal  whereby  he  would  be
awarded  a  percentage  of  the  property  forfeited  as  a  result
of his assistance. RT at 3–650–51. Booky contacted Minkin,
who  instructed  his  client  “in  an  extremely  urgent  way”
to  cooperate  with  the  government.  RT  at  3–652. 6   Minkin
*1514   then  negotiated  a  settlement  of  the  case,  including
cooperation, with Robinson. RT at 2–274–75.

Robinson never raised the issue of conflict of interest with
Minkin  or  Booky  during  the  plea  negotiations  although  he
was aware that Minkin's clients, Crawford and Ohlgart, acting
under  a  cooperation  agreement  negotiated  by  Minkin,  had
provided  the  information  leading  to  Booky's  arrest.  RT  at
2–280. Nor did Robinson ever raise the issue of conflict of
interest with the court. RT at 2–285.

Subsequently, Booky entered into a representation agreement
with  Minkin  which  guaranteed  Minkin  one  third  of  all

sums  the  government  paid  to  Booky  as  a  result  of  his
cooperation. This included any monies Booky might receive
for information leading to forfeiture of property. 7  Def.Ex.H.
Although  Minkin  continued  to  represent  Booky,  Booky's
attorney  of  record  was  Vincent  Oliver,  who  rented  space
in  Minkin's  law  office.  Oliver  acted  as  a  “front  attorney.”
RT  at  3–577.  Both  Robinson  and  Ames  were  aware  that
Minkin actually represented Booky. RT at 2–284, 3–577. The
only  court  appearance  Minkin  made  for  Booky  was  at  his
sentencing on January 29, 1988. RT at 2–285.

During  the  time  between  Booky's  arrest  on  May  31,
1987  and  Marshank's  indictment  on  September  16,  1987,
the  task  force  investigation  centered  on  Marshank  and
Daniel  Hartog,  who  was  suspected  of  running  a  large
scale  marijuana  and  hashish  *1515   smuggling  operation.
With  Minkin's  assistance,  the  government  used  Booky  to
investigate both Hartog and Marshank. Booky was “wired”
to record conversations with Marshank and engaged in other
“active work” on the government's behalf. RT at 3–530. The
government used Booky in this capacity, knowing full well
that Booky's lawyer, Minkin, represented: 1) Crawford and
Ohlgart, who had provided incriminating information about
Booky  and  Marshank;  2)  Bobby  Wehe,  who  had  provided
incriminating information about Booky and Marshank; and
3) Booky himself, who was actively obtaining and providing
incriminating information about Marshank. RT at 2–269, 3–
530.  In  addition,  Minkin  told  the  government  that  he  was
likely to represent Marshank and that Marshank was likely to
cooperate with the government. RT at 2–269.

Booky  eventually  entered  the  Federal  Witness  Protection
Program. Prior to that time the government's only access to
Booky was through Minkin. Booky was hidden by Minkin
and  only  Minkin  knew  his  location.  RT  at  3–758.  The
government thus benefitted from Minkin's role as a conduit
between Booky and the government agents and AUSAs. RT
at 3–759.

After  Booky's  arrest,  the  government  agents  believed  that
in order for Booky to remain a viable active informant, he
would  have  to  convince  his  confederates  that  he  had  not
“rolled  over”  and  was  still  fighting  the  prosecution  of  his
case.  Minkin,  Booky  and  Agent  Ames  agreed  that  Booky
should act as if he were not cooperating with the government
and as if Minkin were defending him. RT at 3–569. During

the  summer  of  1987  Booky  began  to  put  pressure  on  his
confederates,  including  Marshank,  to  pay  for  his  supposed
defense and to provide him with living expenses. See Heng
Decl.,  Exs.  B,  C,  E.  Marshank  paid  ten  thousand  dollars
to Minkin for Booky's defense and expenses. RT at 3–596.
Booky  ostensibly  requested  the  payment  to  convince  his
confederates that he had not become a government informant.
RT at 3–576.

The  government  was  aware  that  Booky  was  pressuring
Marshank for money to pay Minkin's fees. Booky had several
phone  conversations  with  Marshank  in  which  he  indicated
that he needed money to pay Minkin for his defense. These
phone conversations were recorded by the government. Heng
Decl.,  Exs.  C  at  5–8,  Ex.  E.  Agent  Ames  testified  that  he
told Robinson about the payment of money by Marshank to
Minkin,  RT  at  3–587–88,  3–598,  and  that  Robinson  must
have  been  aware  of  the  payments  because  in  the  summer
of  1987  he  was  the  AUSA  on  the  case  and  was  aware  of
the  contents  of  the  taped  Booky  phone  conversations.  RT
at 3–528. 8  The government, however, allowed both Booky
and  Minkin  to  keep  the  money.  None  of  the  money  paid
to  Booky  and  Minkin  was  ever  seized.  RT  at  3–596–98.
The government subsequently used the payment of Minkin's
fees as evidence against Marshank in the second grand jury
proceeding against him. RT 3–673.

During the time between Booky's arrest and the defendant's
indictment,  Booky  received  over  twenty  thousand  dollars
from  various  sources.  RT  at  3–645.  Minkin  received  ten
thousand  dollars  from  Marshank  for  Booky's  ostensible
defense.  Grand  Jury  Proceedings,  Testimony  of  Ronald
Minkin, June 28, 1990, at 27–28. Minkin testified that he gave
half of that sum to Oliver and returned the other half to Booky
for living expenses. RT at 1–186.

In the summer of 1987 it became clear to the government that
Booky  was  suspected  by  his  confederates.  Booky  reported
that  he  was  finding  it  difficult  to  get  close  to  Hartog.  RT
at  3–677.  Robinson,  Ames  and  Yamashita  decided  to  use
the  information  provided  by  Booky  and  Minkin  to  indict
Marshank on a historical conspiracy charge in the hopes that
Marshank  would  then  *1516   provide  information  about  a
thirty-five ton shipment of marijuana, known as the “Hartog
Load”,  that  was  allegedly  being  shipped  from  Thailand.

During the 1987 pre-indictment investigation of Marshank,
then–AUSA  Robinson  knew  that  Minkin  was  representing
Marshank.  RT  at  2–269,  2–323–24.  Robinson  also  knew
that  Minkin  had  told  Agent  Ames  that  Marshank  would
probably  cooperate  with  the  government  because  Minkin
had  been  Marshank's  lawyer  previously.  RT  at  2–328,  2–
350.  In  addition,  Robinson  was  aware  that  the  government
would use information from Minkin's other clients to indict
Marshank. RT at 2–333. Minkin's role, assigned to him by the
government, was to encourage and bring about Marshank's
cooperation. RT at 2–324.

After the decision was made to indict and arrest Marshank,
the grand jury heard testimony from several witnesses. All of
the witnesses who provided testimony against Marshank were
clients of Ron Minkin. RT at 2–272. The grand jury witnesses
were Seth Booky, Robert Wehe, and a government agent who
summarized a statement taken from David Vandrell, another
of Minkin's clients. RT at 2–270, 2–352.

Although  the  government  was  ready  to  arrest  Marshank
following  his  indictment  on  September  16,  1987,  his
whereabouts were unknown. RT at 3–535. Agent Ames called
Agent Rasmussen, who gave Minkin's telephone number to
Ames.  RT  at  2–496.  Ames  then  phoned  Minkin.  Minkin
made inquiries to determine where Marshank was, RT 1–61–
62,  informed  Ames  that  the  defendant  was  in  Florida,  and
provided the agent with Marshank's exact location. RT at 3–
535.

Acting upon the information provided by Minkin, Ames flew
to Florida, found Marshank and arrested him on October 2,
1987.  RT  at  3–536.  By  the  time  of  the  defendant's  arrest,
Agent  Ames  and  AUSA  Robinson  knew  that  Minkin  was
representing Booky, RT at 3–527, and that Booky and Minkin
had provided the government with the information leading to
Marshank's arrest. RT at 3–528.

Agent Ames stated that after he arrested Marshank he read the
defendant his Miranda rights and then suggested that he call
legal counsel. Ames provided Marshank with a telephone to
make the call. Ames Decl. 9:16–21; RT at 3–536–38. Agent
Yamashita testified that it is highly unusual for a government
agent  to  suggest  that  a  suspect  contact  legal  counsel  upon
making an arrest and that the standard procedure for Customs
agents is to avoid any mention of attorneys after suspects are

given the Miranda warning so as not to damage the possibility
of obtaining an interview with the suspect. RT at 3–723–24.
This,  obviously,  was  not  a  concern  of  Agent  Ames  in  this
case. As expected, Marshank called Minkin. RT at 3–537.

Minkin  flew  to  Florida  to  represent  Marshank.  RT  at  3–
538; Def.Ex. L. Agent Rasmussen testified that both Ames
and  Minkin  called  him  either  from  Florida  or  immediately
before they went to Florida; thus, Minkin conferred with the
government  before  meeting  with  his  client.  RT  at  2–441.
By this time Rasmussen was aware that Minkin represented
Booky, RT at 2–444, and that Minkin was going to Florida on
business involving Marshank. Id.

In  Florida,  Agent  Ames  met  first  with  Minkin  and  then
with  Minkin  and  Marshank.  RT  at  3–530–31.  Ames  never
informed Marshank that Minkin had provided the government
with information concerning Marshank's whereabouts or that
Minkin  and  his  clients  had  supplied  the  government  with
the information that led to Marshank's indictment and arrest.
RT  at  3–553–54.  The  meeting  between  Ames,  Minkin  and
Marshank  was  off  the  record  for  the  most  part.  Minkin,
however, did recommend to the defendant that he disclose on
the record the existence of two false passports. RT at 3–532.
Minkin told Ames that he would put the passport discussion
on the record as a “sign of good faith.” Ames Decl. at 11.
At a bail hearing the following week, Marshank's admission
was  used  by  the  government  to  argue  for  detention  of  the
defendant without bail. RT at 3–532. Ames had no knowledge
of  *1517   the  passports  before  learning  about  them  from
Minkin. RT at 3–590.

Agent Ames had concerns about Minkin's ability to represent
Marshank in light of their potential conflict of interest. RT
at  3–524–25.  The  agent  testified  that  before  interviewing
Marshank he called Robinson from Florida and expressed his
concern about Minkin acting as the defendant's lawyer. RT
at 2–526. Ames testified that Robinson told him to proceed
with the arrest and to bring Marshank back to San Francisco.
Robinson said they would “sort it out later,” RT at 3–526–
27, and did not instruct Ames to raise the issue of conflict
of  interest  with  the  court,  the  U.S.  Attorney  in  Florida,  or
with Minkin himself. 9  Ames never informed Marshank or
the court of the potential conflict of interest. RT at 3–554.

Contrary  to  Minkin's  predictions,  Marshank  refused  to
cooperate  with  the  government  following  his  arrest.  After
Marshank's  arrest  Minkin  spoke  with  DEA  Agent  Heng.
Agent  Heng  testified  that  Minkin  was  disappointed  that
his  client  had  refused  to  cooperate.  RT  at  3–823.  Minkin
complained that his client was “crying hysterically” and that,
rather than taking advantage of Marshank's state, Agent Ames
had “dropped the ball” by putting the defendant back in jail.
Def.Ex. Y; RT at 3–796, 3–823. In addition, Minkin lamented
to Robinson that Agent Ames “blew it” because the agent was
not “heavy enough” with Marshank. RT at 2–358–59.

Agent Ames flew with Marshank from Florida to California.
RT at 3–557. During the trip Ames had conversations with
Marshank  about  substantive  matters  related  to  Marshank's
case,  even  though  the  agent  was  aware  that  Marshank  was
represented by counsel. RT at 3–557–60. After Marshank was
returned to San Francisco, he dismissed Minkin and retained
his current counsel.

Marshank's  ex-wife,  Jane  Wechsler,  stated  that  she  called
Minkin  on  October  6,  1987,  after  learning  of  Marshank's
arrest,  to  see  if  she  could  be  of  any  help.  In  her  sworn
declaration, Wechsler recounted that Minkin claimed “he was
the only person who could handle Steven's case, that if Steven
knew what was best he would keep Minkin as his lawyer and
would cooperate with the government ‘one hundred percent.’
” Wechsler Aff. ¶ 6. Minkin also allegedly told Wechsler that
Marshank would have to pay Minkin one million dollars and
that federal agents would see to it that Marshank was able to
obtain money from foreign bank accounts. Wechsler Aff. ¶
8, 9. In addition, Wechsler contends that Minkin suggested
that  it  would  be  helpful  for  government  agents  to  arrest
Julie  Aldwell,  a  friend  of  Marshank's  with  whom  he  was
purportedly involved in drug smuggling. Wechsler Aff. ¶ 18.
Minkin allegedly told Wechsler that Aldwell's arrest would
help Marshank “come to his senses,” since Aldwell would be
forced  to  inform  on  Marshank  in  order  to  save  herself  and
Marshank would then “feel the noose tightening around his
neck.” Id.

Minkin  maintained  contact  with  government  agents  and
provided them with substantive evidence against Marshank.
The agents often took notes of their telephone conversations
with Minkin. See Def.Ex. O and Y. Minkin often called the
agents to give them information on Marshank's activities. 10

Def.Ex. Y. For example, Minkin provided information about
Marshank  to  *1518   Agents  Ames  and  Yamashita  on
numerous occasions in the months prior to Marshank's arrest
in  October  1987.  RT  at  3–583,  3–599,  3–720  3–742.  In
August 1987 Minkin met with Ames and Yamashita to help
the  agents  decipher  “the  matrix”  previously  provided  by
Minkin, Crawford and Ohlgart and to provide the government
with additional information. RT at 3–717–18.

Yamashita's  notes  dated  October  9,  1987,  one  week  after
Marshank was arrested in Florida, indicate that Minkin called
Yamashita and gave him the location of Deborah Hawkins,
a witness the government was looking for in the Marshank
case.  Def.Ex.  Y;  RT  at  3–743.  An  undated  note  indicates
that  Minkin  called  Yamashita  and  gave  him  the  name
of  somebody  with  whom  Marshank  allegedly  distributed
cocaine. Def.Ex. Y; RT at 3–762. On yet another occasion,
Minkin called Yamashita and gave the agent the name of an
individual who was willing to provide the government with
incriminating  information  concerning  Marshank.  RT  at  3–
760.

Agent Heng testified that he had at least fifteen discussions
with Minkin after the attorney was fired by Marshank. RT at
3–792. During at least some of these conversations, Minkin
provided Heng with information concerning Marshank. RT at
3–792.

In November 1987, FBI Agent Rasmussen met with AUSA
Zanides,  who  had  taken  over  the  Marshank  case  from
Peter Robinson. RT at 2–445. Zanides informed Rasmussen
that  he  was  going  to  dismiss  the  1987  indictment  against
Marshank.  The  AUSA  believed  that  the  evidence  gathered
was insufficient to result in a conviction at trial and believed
that  Marshank  had  been  undercharged.  RT  at  2–445–46;
Gov.  In  Camera  Submission,  Ex.  II.  In  a  November  25,
1987 memorandum to then U.S. Attorney Joseph Russoniello
(“Zanides Memorandum”), Zanides explained that the reason
the  case  had  been  brought  so  early  was  because  it  was
expected  that  Marshank  would  cooperate  and  provide
information  about  the  thirty-five  ton  Hartog  load.  Gov.  In

1987 indictment, it was his intention to re-indict Marshank

After the dismissal of the first indictment, the investigation
of Marshank continued. In December 1987, Minkin attended

a  meeting  with  San  Francisco-based  government  agents
working  on  the  Marshank  case  and  introduced  Crawford
and  Ohlgart  to  the  agents  in  order  to  “lay  the  groundwork
for  further  meetings.”  Def.Ex.  Q;  RT  at  3–738–39.  Agent
Rasmussen  had  continuing  contact  with  Minkin  after
Marshank's  first  indictment  was  dismissed  and  up  through
October  1990.  RT  at  2–473–77.  Minkin  called  Rasmussen
on  various  occasions  to  give  the  agent  information  on
individuals,  including  Marshank,  in  whom  the  government
might have an interest. RT at 2–474.

Minkin testified at the June 28, 1990 grand jury proceedings
leading to the instant indictment against Marshank. In fact,
Minkin did not stop providing information to the government
about Marshank until after the motion to dismiss at issue here
was  filed  and  AUSA  Howden,  the  most  recent  prosecutor
assigned to the case, instructed government agents not to have
any more contact with the defendant's former attorney. RT at
2–477, 3–810.

DISCUSSION
The defendant argues that the indictment against him must be
dismissed because the government engaged in prosecutorial
misconduct which violated his Fifth Amendment right to due
process and Sixth Amendment right to assistance of counsel.

  While  application  of  the  Sixth  Amendment  is

  [2]

I. Fifth Amendment
[1]
limited to government action which occurs after the initiation
of  adverse  criminal  proceedings,  a  defendant's  remedy
for  prosecutorial  misconduct  in  the  pre-indictment  stage
is  provided  in  the  due  process  protections  of  the  Fifth
Amendment.  United  States  v.  Marion,  404  U.S.  307,  315,
92 S.Ct. 455, 460, 30 L.Ed.2d 468 (1971); United States v.
Simmons, 536 F.2d 827, 830 n. 9 (9th Cir.1976). Depending
*1519   on  when  it  occurs,  government  misconduct  which
subverts  a  defendant's  relationship  with  his  client  may  be
judged  under  the  standards  of  both  the  Fifth  and  the  Sixth
Amendments. A Fifth Amendment due process violation may
occur  when  government  interference  in  an  attorney-client
relationship  results  in  ineffective  assistance  of  counsel  or
when the government engages in outrageous misconduct.

  [7]

 The government contends that it did nothing wrong

[6]
and that the blame for any misconduct lies solely with Minkin.
This court cannot agree. The government collaborated with
Marshank's  attorney  to  build  a  case  against  him,  to  effect
his  arrest,  and  to  ensure  that  he  would  cooperate  with  the
government  rather  than  contest  the  charges  against  him.
Marshank  was  first  identified  as  a  prospective  target  for
criminal investigation as a result of information provided to
the government by Minkin and two of his other clients. The
government then actively worked with Minkin to develop a
case against Marshank. 11

Government  agents  and  AUSA  Robinson  used  information
supplied  by  Minkin  to  arrest  Seth  Booky,  even  though  the
government  knew  that  Minkin  had  previously  represented
Booky  and  would  most  likely  represent  him  on  the
charges  which  arose  from  Minkin's  collaboration  with
the  government.  The  government  then  used  Booky  as  an
informant to assist in the investigation of Marshank, despite
the  fact  that  the  government  was  aware  that  Minkin  had
previously  represented  Marshank  and  would  most  likely
represent him if he was charged with a crime as a result of the
investigation in which Minkin and Booky participated.

The government's decision to use Ron Minkin and Minkin's
clients  to  develop  a  case  against  Steven  Marshank  created
a  conflict  of  interest  between  Minkin  and  Marshank.  The

government  was  aware  of  this  conflict  and  took  advantage
of  it.  The  government  did  nothing  to  alert  either  the  court
or the defendant to the conflict of interest. It did nothing to
alert Minkin, who was apparently oblivious, to any conflict.
While  the  government  may  have  no  obligation  to  caution
defense counsel against straying from the ethical path, it is
not entitled to take advantage of conflicts of interest of which
the defendant and the court are unaware.

*1520   In  this  case,  the  government  went  so  far  as  to
participate  in  efforts  to  mask  the  conflict  of  interest  from
the  defendant.  The  government  was  aware  that  Booky  and
Minkin  solicited  funds  from  Marshank  and  his  associates,
ostensibly  to  pay  Booky's  legal  fees.  Government  agents
taped and reviewed numerous conversations between Booky,
Marshank  and  Marshank's  associates  discussing  the  legal
fees needed for Booky's defense. Knowing that no defense
was being mounted and that the legal fees were obtained by
Minkin under false pretenses, the government did not seize
the  funds  transferred  from  Marshank  and  his  associates  to
Booky and Minkin, but allowed Minkin and his client to keep
the money. Had Marshank been aware of Booky's decision
to cooperate with the government, the defendant would have
been alerted to Minkin's conflict of interest. Even after the
defendant's arrest, the government did nothing to advise him
of the conflict. Instead, the government colluded in the effort
to  hide  the  relationship  between  Minkin,  Booky  and  the
government by failing to inform Marshank of his attorney's
role in his investigation.

Worse yet, the record makes clear that the government plotted
with  Minkin  to  ensure  Marshank's  arrest  and  then  steered
Marshank in Minkin's direction to guarantee his cooperation.
After  obtaining  the  indictment  against  Marshank,  Agent
Ames  called  Minkin,  who  informed  the  government  of
Marshank's whereabouts. Ames then went to Florida to arrest
Marshank.  Minkin  consulted  with  Agent  Rasmussen  after
Marshank's arrest but before speaking with his client. Upon
arresting  Marshank,  Agent  Ames  departed  from  standard
procedure  and  encouraged  Marshank  to  call  a  lawyer,
knowing that the lawyer he contacted would be Minkin, that
Minkin  had  provided  the  government  with  the  information
leading  to  Marshank's  arrest,  and  that  Minkin  would  do
everything  in  his  power  to  deliver  Marshank's  cooperation
to the government. Although Agent Ames expressed concern
to  AUSA  Robinson  about  the  conflict  of  interest  between

Marshank and Minkin, neither the agent nor the prosecutor
ever made Marshank or the court aware of this conflict.

In  light  of  the  astonishing  facts  of  this  case,  it  is  beyond
question  that  Minkin's  representation  of  Marshank  was
rendered  completely  ineffectual  and  that  the  government
was  a  knowing  participant  in  the  circumstances  that  made
the  representation  ineffectual.  Minkin  essentially  turned
Marshank over to the government in an effort to force him
to  cooperate.  Indeed,  as  a  result  of  the  retainer  agreement
between Minkin and Booky, Minkin stood to gain millions
of  dollars  if  Marshank's  property  was  seized  as  a  result
of  his  prosecution.  Minkin's  conduct  during  the  post-arrest
meeting  between  Marshank  and  the  government  suggests
that  he  was  attempting  to  worsen  Marshank's  position  vis-
a-vis  the  government  in  order  to  ensure  that  Marshank
would cooperate. In this regard, Minkin advised Marshank to
provide Agent Ames with incriminating information on the
record and with no protection as a “sign of good faith.”

It  is  clear  to  the  court  that  Minkin's  primary  interest  was
to  convince  Marshank  to  cooperate  with  the  government.
After  Marshank's  arrest,  Minkin  attempted  to  engage  the
defendant's former wife in a scheme to “tighten the noose”
around Marshank's neck and to persuade him to cooperate.
When Marshank refused to cooperate, Minkin complained to
Agent Rasmussen that Agent Ames had “dropped the ball” by
not being “heavy enough” with Marshank.

The government's knowledge that Minkin would attempt to
induce  Marshank  to  cooperate  affected  the  timing  of  the
first  indictment.  In  a  November  25,  1987  memo  to  then
U.S.  Attorney  Joseph  Russoniello,  AUSA  Mark  Zanides,
who  took  over  the  Marshank  case  from  AUSA  Robinson,
recommended that the first indictment against Marshank be
dismissed  without  prejudice  because  the  evidence  gathered
was  insufficient.  Gov.  In  Camera  Submission,  Ex.  II.  In
attempting  to  explain  why  the  indictment  had  been  sought
and the defendant arrested in light of the weak case against
him,  Zanides  observed  that  “certain  investigative  *1521
steps  necessary  to  corroborate  a  historical  drug  conspiracy
were  not  undertaken,”  in  part  because  the  government
expected that Marshank, when arrested, would cooperate with
the  government.  Id.  The  government  chose  to  indict  and
arrest Marshank without sufficient evidence to convict him
because they believed that Minkin could ensure Marshank's
cooperation. With the defendant's attorney in the government

camp, the strength of the government's case against Marshank
became irrelevant.

Under  Irwin  and  Horowitz,  interference  with  the  attorney-
client relationship is not enough, in and of itself, to constitute
a  due  process  violation.  There  must  also  be  prejudice  to
the  defendant.  Irwin,  612  F.2d  at  1187.  Prejudice  may
manifest itself in a number of ways, including use of evidence
gained  through  the  interference,  use  by  the  prosecution
of  confidential  information  regarding  defense  plans  and
strategy, or destruction of the attorney-client relationship. Id.
Prejudice may also result from “other actions designed to give
the prosecution an unfair advantage at trial.” Id.

It is clear that Marshank was prejudiced by the government
misconduct  in  this  case.  First,  the  facts  strongly  suggest
that, absent the government's improper interference with the
relationship between Minkin and his clients, there would not
have been any indictments against Marshank. Minkin, along
with his clients Crawford and Ohlgart, identified Marshank to
the government and were thus responsible for his becoming
the  target  of  criminal  investigation  in  the  first  instance.
Minkin  and  his  client  Seth  Booky  were  instrumental  in
the  pre-indictment  investigation  of  Marshank.  During  the
proceedings  before  the  first  grand  jury,  all  three  of  the
witnesses presenting testimony—Seth Booky, Robert Wehe,
and David Vandell—were clients of Ron Minkin. Minkin and
his clients were also integrally involved in the investigation
which resulted in the instant indictment against the defendant.
Minkin provided information to the government concerning
Marshank on a consistent basis and testified against Marshank
during the 1990 grand jury proceedings.

Marshank  was  also  prejudiced  in  numerous  other  ways.
Evidence  obtained  through  government  misconduct  was
used  against  Marshank  at  every  turn.  The  testimony  of
three of Minkin's clients before the grand jury demonstrates
beyond question that the government marshalled the evidence
provided  by  Minkin  and  his  clients  to  obtain  the  first
indictment.  Minkin's  cooperation  with  the  government
throughout the investigation leading to the instant indictment,
his testimony against Marshank before the second grand jury,
and the prominence of Seth Booky in the second indictment
all lead inexorably to the conclusion that evidence obtained
through  government  misconduct  was  used  to  obtain  the
second indictment against the defendant.

It is also apparent that the government's misconduct in this
case was designed to and would give the prosecution an unfair
advantage at trial. The court need not retrace the source of
the  government's  evidence  against  Marshank,  other  than  to
say that most, if not all of it, appears to have come directly
or indirectly from Ron Minkin. Moreover, while he was in
custody  Marshank  believed  that  he  was  being  represented
by  counsel  who  was  uncompromised.  In  fact,  however,
Marshank's  attorney  was  in  league  with  the  government.
Marshank  was,  for  all  intents  and  purposes,  unrepresented
during  his  post-arrest  meetings  with  the  government.  The
government  took  advantage  of  this  situation  to  obtain
incriminating information from Marshank and to engage in
post-indictment, post-arrest communications with Marshank
outside the presence of counsel.

  [9]

 Having found a Fifth Amendment violation under

[8]
Irwin,  the  court  must  decide  the  appropriate  remedy.  In
making this determination, the court must tailor the remedy to
the injury. United States v. Rogers, 751 F.2d 1074, 1078 (9th
Cir.1985).  The  appropriate  remedy  for  a  Fifth  Amendment
violation  is  generally  suppression  of  the  evidence.  Rogers,
751  F.2d  at  1078.  However,  dismissal  of  the  indictment
is appropriate where continuing prejudice from  *1522  the
constitutional  violation  cannot  be  remedied  by  suppression
of  the  evidence.  United  States  v.  Morrison,  449  U.S.  361,
365–66 n. 2, 101 S.Ct. 665, 669 n. 2, 66 L.Ed.2d 564 (1981);
Rogers, 751 F.2d at 1078.

[10]
 Suppression is an appropriate remedy where the court
can  identify  and  isolate  the  evidence  obtained  in  violation
of the defendant's Fifth Amendment due process rights. The
prosecution  is  thus  denied  “the  fruits  of  its  transgression”
and the due process right to a fair trial is preserved. Rogers,
751  F.2d  at  1078.  In  the  case  at  bar,  however,  the  fruit
of  the  prosecutor's  transgression  is  the  indictment  itself.  In
such  a  situation,  it  is  simply  impossible  to  excise  the  taint
of  the  government's  constitutional  transgressions  from  the
prosecution of the defendant. The taint of the government's
transgressions  spreads  to  all  the  evidence  obtained  against
Marshank.

[11]
 Because of the bizarre circumstances surrounding the
investigation  and  prosecution  of  the  defendant,  it  is  not
surprising  that  neither  the  parties  nor  the  court  has  been
able to find case law based on facts similar to those found
here.  However,  United  States  v.  Schell,  775  F.2d  559  (4th

U.S. v. Marshank, 777 F.Supp. 1507 (1991)
60 USLW 2386
Cir.1985),  cert.  denied,  475  U.S.  1098,  106  S.Ct.  1498,
89  L.Ed.2d  898  (1986),  is  persuasive  as  to  the  appropriate
remedy.  In  Schell,  Jividen,  a  criminal  defense  attorney,
briefly represented Wilson and Cain, both of whom had been
subpoenaed  to  testify  before  a  grand  jury  investigating  the
Gallo  drug  organization.  Several  months  later,  Jividen  was
hired  as  an  Assistant  U.S.  Attorney.  Jividen  informed  the
U.S. Attorney of his previous representation of Wilson and
Cain, and as a result Jividen was not allowed to participate in
any way in the gathering of evidence against or prosecution
of his former clients. Schell, 775 F.2d at 563. However, in
his  capacity  as  Assistant  U.S.  Attorney,  Jividen  appeared
in  front  of  a  different  grand  jury  investigating  the  Gallo
drug organization. Jividen's former clients testified before one
grand jury and Jividen appeared before another one. Schell,
775  F.2d  at  563  n.  2.  Wilson  and  Cain  were  subsequently
indicted along with numerous other alleged members of the
drug  organization.  Both  defendants  moved  to  dismiss  their
indictments on the grounds that Jividen's participation in the
grand jury proceeding violated their due process rights.

In  Schell  the  government  argued  that  it  had  engaged  in
no  impropriety,  pointing  out  that  Jividen's  participation
had  been  limited  to  prosecution  of  other  members  of  the
drug  organization  and  that  the  AUSA  had  been  excluded
from  work  on  the  cases  against  Wilson  and  Cain.  The
prosecution further maintained that Jividen did not possess
any  confidential  information  with  respect  to  his  former
clients.  Rejecting  the  government's  argument,  the  court
observed:

Assuming that all of the government's
assertions  are  true,  the  fact  remains
that  Jividen  represented  Wilson  and
Cain  with  respect  to  the  very  same
criminal  activity  which  led  to  the
indictment that he ultimately helped to
prosecute and under which Wilson and
Cain were convicted.

Schell,  775  F.2d  at  565.  The  court  then  dismissed  the
indictments  against  Wilson  and  Cain,  holding  that  “due
process is violated when an attorney represents a client and
then participates in the prosecution of that client with respect
to the same matter.” Schell, 775 F.2d at 566.

While  Ron  Minkin  was  never  hired  by  the  U.S.  Attorney's
office he participated in the prosecution of his own client far
more than did the attorney in Schell. The government in this
case not only took no precautions to separate Minkin's work
with the government from the investigation and prosecution
of the defendant, but relied on Minkin to build a case against
the defendant. As the Schell court pointed out:

joins

The  relationship  between  an  attorney
and his client is a sacred one. In that
relationship, the client must be secure
in the knowledge that any information
he  reveals  to  counsel  will  remain
confidential. The confidentiality of the
attorney-client relationship is severely
compromised, 
if  not  destroyed,

*1523   prosecution  of  that  client

counseled  the  client.  Such  switching
of  sides 
is  fundamentally  unfair
and  inherently  prejudicial.  Without
question,  the  client's  right  to  a  fair
trial,  secured  by  the  due  process
clauses  of  the  fifth  and  fourteenth
amendments,  is  compromised  under
these circumstances.

Schell, 775 F.2d at 565.

In  this  case,  even  more  than  in  Schell,  the  defendant's
due  process  right  to  a  fair  trial  has  been  compromised
by  the  government's  interference  in  the  attorney-client
relationship. As discussed above, the taint of the government's
constitutional  transgression  infected  every  part  of  the
investigation and prosecution of the defendant. There is no
means other than dismissal of the indictment to remedy the
due process violation which occurred. Morrison, 449 U.S. at
366 n. 2, 101 S.Ct. at 668 n. 2; Rogers, 751 F.2d at 1078. The
indictment is, therefore, DISMISSED.

  “[T]he  determination  of  when  the  government's

Cir.1986), vacated on other grounds, U.S. v. Wingender, 790
F.2d 802 (9th Cir.1986) (quoting United States v. Jannotti,
673 F.2d 578, 606 (3d Cir.) (en banc), cert. denied, 457 U.S.
1106, 102 S.Ct. 2906, 73 L.Ed.2d 1315 (1982)). Therefore,
every  case  must  be  resolved  on  its  facts.  Bogart,  783  F.2d
at 1438. Whether outrageous government misconduct exists
turns  on  the  totality  of  the  circumstances.  United  States  v.
Tobias, 662 F.2d 381, 387 (5th Cir.1981), cert. denied, 457
U.S. 1108, 102 S.Ct. 2908, 73 L.Ed.2d 1317 (1982).

[14]
  In  United  States  v.  Batres–Santolino,  521  F.Supp.
744,  750–53  (N.D.Cal.1981),  Russell  was  invoked  to
dismiss an indictment resulting from outrageous government
misconduct which induced the defendant to commit a crime.
See  also  Bogart,  783  F.2d  at  1434–38  (discussing  the
history of the doctrine's evolution and application). However,
because the Russell doctrine is grounded in the due process
clause  of  the  Fifth  Amendment,  it  may  be  applied  in
cases  where  government  interference  in  an  attorney-client
relationship is so shocking to “the universal sense of justice”
that it violates due process. See United States v. Ofshe, 817
F.2d 1508, 1516 (11th Cir.1987).

[15]
  The  prosecution's  argument  that  its  actions  were  not
improper  because  only  Minkin  engaged  in  misconduct  is
unpersuasive.  The  Ninth  Circuit  has  distinguished  between
the  government's  “passive  tolerance”  of  misconduct  and
“conscious direction” by government agents, suggesting that
the  former  is  less  egregious  and  therefore  tempers  the
outrageousness  of  any  government  misconduct.  Simpson  I,

813  F.2d  at  1468.  In  Simpson  I,  a  prostitute  working  as  a
government informant developed a sexual relationship with
the defendant and then helped to arrange a drug transaction
between the defendant and undercover agents. Although the
government agent on the case eventually learned of the sexual
relationship,  he  did  nothing  to  encourage  the  informant  to
use  sex  to  *1524   carry  out  her  assignment  and  in  fact
instructed  the  informant  on  numerous  occasions  to  refrain
from  engaging  in  sexual  activity  with  the  defendant.  Id.
at  1467–68.  Emphasizing  the  “unique  facts”  of  the  case,
the  court  ruled  that  the  government's  conduct  was  not  so
outrageous as to shock the conscience. Id. at 1468.

The government's actions in this case are far more egregious
than  the  “passive  tolerance”  of  impropriety  in  Simpson  I.
As  the  court's  findings  of  fact  illustrate,  the  government
actively collaborated with Ron Minkin to build a case against
the  defendant,  showing  a  complete  lack  of  respect  for  the
constitutional  rights  of  the  defendant  and  Minkin's  other
clients  and  an  utter  disregard  for  the  government's  ethical
obligations. Unlike the government agent in Simpson I, the
agents  and  prosecutor  here  never  warned  Minkin  not  to
engage  in  unethical  behavior  and  in  fact  facilitated  that
behavior  by  hiding  it  from  the  defendant.  Moreover,  the
government  colluded  with  Minkin  to  obtain  an  indictment
against  the  defendant,  to  arrest  the  defendant,  to  ensure
that  Minkin  would  represent  the  defendant  despite  his
obvious conflict of interest, and to guarantee the defendant's
cooperation with the government. The government conduct
in this case was anything but passive.

his  clients.  Indeed,  government  agents  and  the  prosecutor
allowed  Minkin  to  hide  his  dealings  with  the  government
from his clients and participated in the charade.

Having  considered  the  totality  of  the  circumstances,  the
court  concludes  that  the  conduct  of  the  government  in  the
investigation  and  prosecution  of  Steven  Marshank  was  so
outrageous  that  it  shocked  the  universal  sense  of  justice.
Because the government's conduct was fundamentally unfair,
the indictment is DISMISSED.

II. Sixth Amendment
The defendant contends that the government created a conflict
of  interest  between  himself  and  his  attorney  which  denied
him his Sixth Amendment right to counsel. The government
denies  that  it  engaged  in  any  misconduct.  The  government
further  contends  that  even  if  any  misconduct  did  occur,  it
did not taint the 1990 indictment. Moreover, the government
claims that the attorney-client relationship between Minkin
and  Marshank  was  invalid  because  Marshank  consulted
Minkin  in  order  to  carry  out  illegal  activity.  Finally,  the
government contends that Marshank waived the conflict of
interest between himself and Minkin by agreeing to pay Seth
Booky's legal fees.

  The  right  to  counsel  is  “indispensable  to  the

  [17]

[16]
fair  administration  of  our  adversarial  system  of  criminal
justice.”  Maine  v.  Moulton,  474  U.S.  159,  168–69,  106
S.Ct.  477,  483,  88  L.Ed.2d  481  (1985).  The  Ninth  Circuit
has  recognized  that  government  misconduct  may  have
a  “devastating  *1525   effect”  on  a  defendant's  Sixth
Amendment right to counsel. United States v. Owen, 580 F.2d
365,  367  (9th  Cir.1978).  Indeed,  government  interference
with a defendant's relationship with his attorney may render
that attorney's assistance ineffective and thus violate the Sixth
Amendment. United States v. Irwin, 612 F.2d at 1185. The
Sixth  Amendment  right  to  effective  assistance  of  counsel
includes  “the  right  to  be  represented  by  counsel  whose
loyalties  are  undivided.”  United  States  v.  Partin,  601  F.2d
1000, 1006 (9th Cir.1979), cert. denied, 446 U.S. 964, 100
S.Ct.  2939,  64  L.Ed.2d  822  (1980).  See  also  Cuyler  v.
Sullivan, 446 U.S. 335, 348, 100 S.Ct. 1708, 1718, 64 L.Ed.2d
333 (1980).

defendant's Sixth Amendment rights are violated only when
the government intrusion results in prejudice to the defendant.
Id. at 1187. Prejudice may manifest itself in numerous ways,
including destruction of the attorney-client relationship. Id. at
1187, 1188–89.

  [20]

 As with a Fifth Amendment violation, a violation

[19]
of  the  Sixth  Amendment  requires  a  remedy  tailored  to  the
injury  suffered.  Morrison,  449  U.S.  at  364,  101  S.Ct.  at
667;  Rogers,  751  F.2d  at  1078.  Once  again,  in  most  cases
suppression  of  the  evidence,  rather  than  dismissal,  is  the
appropriate remedy. Morrison, 449 U.S. at 365–66, 366 n. 3,
101 S.Ct. at 668, 669 n. 3; Rogers, 751 F.2d at 1078. However
dismissal is appropriate where there is continuing prejudice
from  a  constitutional  violation  that  cannot  be  remedied  by
suppression of the evidence. Morrison, 449 U.S. at 365–66 n.
2, 101 S.Ct. at 669 n. 2; Rogers, 751 F.2d at 1078.

[21]
  The  prosecution's  argument  that  it  engaged  in  no
misconduct is unconvincing because the Supreme Court has
explicitly recognized the government's affirmative obligation
not  to  subvert  the  Sixth  Amendment  right  to  counsel.  In
Maine v. Moulton, the Court stated:

Once the right to counsel has attached
and  been  asserted,  the  State  must  of
course  honor  it.  This  means  more
than  simply  that  the  State  cannot
prevent  the  accused  from  obtaining
the  assistance  of  counsel.  The  Sixth
Amendment also imposes on the State
an  affirmative  obligation  to  respect
and  preserve  the  accused's  choice
to  seek  this  assistance.  We  ...  have
made  clear  that,  at  the  very  least,
the  prosecutor  and  police  have  an
affirmative  obligation  not  to  act  in  a
manner that circumvents and thereby
dilutes the protection afforded by the
right to counsel.

474  U.S.  at  170–71,  176,  106  S.Ct.  at  484,  487  (emphasis
added).  Whether  government  action  violates  a  defendant's
right to the assistance of counsel is to be determined in light
of this affirmative obligation. Id.

[18]
  Not  all  government  interference  constitutes  a  Sixth
Amendment  violation.  Irwin,  612  F.2d  at  1186–87.  A

60 USLW 2386
[22]
 Considering the government's collaboration with Ron
Minkin  in  the  investigation,  arrest  and  prosecution  of  the
defendant after his September 1987 indictment, it is beyond
cavil  that  the  government  failed  to  fulfil  its  affirmative
obligation as described in Moulton. There can be no question
but that the government in this case circumvented and diluted
the  protections  guaranteed  to  the  defendant  by  the  Sixth
Amendment right to counsel.

[23]
  The  government  maintains  that  even  if  it  violated
Marshank's Sixth Amendment rights in connection with the
first  indictment,  the  second  indictment  against  Marshank
remains untainted because it involves different charges. The
prosecution  correctly  points  out  that  the  Sixth  Amendment
attaches  only  after  judicial  proceedings  have  been  initiated
against a defendant in a criminal case. Brewer v. Williams,

(1977).  However,  the  government  errs  in  concluding  that
the  defendant's  first  and  second  indictments  necessarily
represent two distinct prosecutions for the purposes of Sixth
Amendment analysis.

In  United  States  v.  Valencia,  541  F.2d  618,  622  (6th
Cir.1976),  the  Sixth  Circuit  rejected  an  argument,  similar
to  the  one  offered  by  the  government  here,  that  the
*1526   defendant's  Sixth  Amendment  rights  had  not  been
violated  because  the  government  interference  was  related
to  charges  which  had  been  dismissed  and  was  unrelated
to  the  subsequent  indictment  challenged  by  the  defendant.
However,  the  court  ruled  that  dismissal  of  an  indictment
against a defendant does not bring an end to the prosecution
of the defendant if the defendant is later reindicted on charges
which “grow out of the same dealings that were the subject of
the [prior] charges.” Valencia, 541 F.2d at 622.

[24]
  The  Valencia  holding  reflects  the  core  principles  of
Sixth Amendment doctrine. The Sixth Amendment attaches
after the initiation of judicial proceedings because it is at this
point that

the  government  has  committed  itself
to  prosecute,  and 
...  the  adverse
positions of government and defendant
have  solidified.

the  intricacies  of  substantive  and
procedural criminal law.

Kirby  v.  Illinois,  406  U.S.  682,  689,  92  S.Ct.  1877,  1882,
32  L.Ed.2d  411  (1972).  Having  engaged  in  prosecutorial
misconduct  the  government  may  not  evade  the  Sixth
Amendment simply by dismissing the initial indictment and
reindicting the defendant on charges stemming from the same
investigation. To hold otherwise would allow the government
to use its prosecutorial powers to eviscerate defendants' right
to counsel.

[25]
  Applying  Valencia  to  the  case  at  bar,  the  court
concludes  that  the  instant  indictment  is  tainted  by  the
government's violation of the defendant's Sixth Amendment
right  to  counsel.  The  government's  investigation  of  Steven
Marshank revolved around an alleged historical conspiracy
involving the importation and sale of marijuana and hashish.
The first indictment charged the defendant with offenses that
allegedly  occurred  early  on  in  the  conspiracy.  The  record
reveals that the first indictment was dismissed in order to give
the government the opportunity to gather additional evidence.
The  facts  also  show  that  the  government  investigation  of
the  defendant  was  ongoing  at  the  time  the  indictment  was
dismissed,  and  that  the  government  had  every  intention  of
continuing the investigation against the defendant until it had
sufficient evidence to reindict him.

The  Zanides  Memorandum  explained  that  in  1987  the
government had not gathered sufficient evidence to support
a  historical  drug  conspiracy  prosecution.  Gov.  In  Camera
Submission,  Ex.  II  at  2.  In  addition,  AUSA  Zanides
complained  that  the  charges  against  Marshank  in  the  first
indictment  were  too  narrow  to  reflect  the  defendant's
alleged “degree of involvement” in drug trafficking. Zanides
therefore  outlined  a  plan  for  the  continued  investigation
of  Marshank  in  order  to  broaden  the  charges  in  a  second
indictment. Id. at 3–4. Following-up on information provided
by  the  “cooperating  defendants,”  Minkin's  cooperating
clients, was central to this plan. Id.

In the months following the dismissal of the first indictment,
Minkin  remained  in  frequent  contact  with  government
agents  so  as  to  assist  them  in  the  investigation  of
Marshank.  He  arranged  a  meeting  between  government
agents and his cooperating clients, Ohlgart and Crawford, to
encourage the continued cooperation of the two men in the

U.S. v. Marshank, 777 F.Supp. 1507 (1991)
60 USLW 2386
investigation. Minkin had numerous telephone conversations
with government agents regarding the investigation leading
up to the second indictment of Marshank. Indeed, Minkin's
participation  in  the  investigation  of  Marshank  did  not  end
until the defendant filed this motion to dismiss and AUSA
Howden advised government agents to cease communication
with Minkin.

The  proceedings  before  the  second  grand  jury  show  that
Minkin's client Seth Booky was the government's key witness
against the defendant. Booky's testimony took up a substantial
portion of the proceedings and was the foundation upon which
the government built its case against Marshank. See Grand
Jury 87–4, Testimony of Seth Booky, July 17, 1988; Grand
Jury 89–3, Testimony of Paul Rozairo (reading testimony of
Booky), December 14, 1989; Grand Jury 89–3, Testimony of
Dan McCurrie  *1527  (reading testimony of Booky), January
11, 1990; Grand Jury 89–3, Testimony of Seth Booky, March
15, 1990.

The  second  indictment  was,  unquestionably,  a  result  of
the government's ongoing investigation of Marshank, which
began  in  1986,  prior  to  the  first  indictment.  The  overt
acts  alleged  in  the  second  indictment  primarily  involved
illegal  activity  which  Marshank  and  Seth  Booky  engaged
in  together.  Indeed,  the  record  of  the  second  grand  jury
proceedings  makes  it  clear  that  Booky  was  the  source  of
virtually  all  of  the  allegations  of  overt  acts.  Booky  was
the  source  of  every  act  for  which  a  source  was  identified.
Grand Jury 89–3, Testimony of Robert Heng, July 26, 1990,
at  43–44,  46–49,  52,  54,  57,  73–74,  77–78,  80,  81.  The
testimony  of  Agent  Heng  strongly  suggests  that,  with  the
exception  of  two  acts  of  which  Booky  had  no  knowledge,
Booky  was  the  source  for  each  of  the  forty-four  overt  acts
in  which  it  is  alleged  that  the  defendant  participated. 13
Booky's  prominence  is  so  striking  that  one  of  the  grand
jurors expressed concern that the informant appeared to be
the  sole  source  of  the  government's  charges.  Testimony  of
Heng,  at  19.  Based  on  the  proceedings  before  the  second
grand jury, the court concludes that there would have been
no  second  indictment  without  Booky's  cooperation  with
the  government's  investigation.  In  light  of  these  facts,  the
court  finds  that  the  two  indictments  are,  for  purposes  of
Sixth Amendment analysis, part of the same prosecution of
Marshank.

  [27]

 The government argues that the attorney-

  [28]

[26]
client relationship between Marshank and Minkin was invalid
because  the  two  were  engaged  in  ongoing  illegal  activity.
The government relies on In re Grand Jury Proceedings, 867
F.2d 539, 541 (9th Cir.1989), which holds that the attorney-
client privilege is vitiated when a client consults an attorney
for  legal  assistance  in  carrying  out  a  crime.  To  establish  a
prima facie case for this, so-called crime-fraud exception to
the  attorney-client  privilege,  the  government  must  rely  on
evidence  independent  of  the  communications  between  the
client  and  the  attorney.  Id.  In  addition,  where  an  attorney
has represented a defendant in the same criminal matter in
which the attorney is implicated, the crime-fraud exception
“does not thereby justify an abrogation of the privilege as to
all dealings between the two, as attorney and client.” United
States v. Alexander, 736 F.Supp. 968, 1003 (D.Minn.1990).
*1528   Where  a  defendant  has  had  discussions  with  an
attorney regarding his or her defense against criminal charges,
those conversations are lawful and fall within the ambit of
the  attorney-client  privilege  even  if  there  is  evidence  that
the  attorney  participated  in  other  illegal  activity  with  the
defendant. Valencia, 541 F.2d at 621.

The  government's  argument  for  the  crime-fraud  exception
to  attorney-client  privilege  lacks  merit  for  three  reasons.
First, while there is evidence in the record that Minkin may
have  been  involved  in  criminal  activity,  it  is  not  enough
to establish a prima facie case that the defendant consulted
with  Minkin  to  complete  a  crime. 14   Second,  discussions
between  Minkin  and  Marshank  regarding  criminal  charges
already  facing  the  defendant  do  not  fall  within  the  crime-
fraud exception. Valencia, 541 F.2d at 621; Alexander, 736
F.Supp. at 1003. Third, the crime-fraud exception was simply
not meant to be applied in the manner which the government
attempts  here.  “Because  the  attorney-client  privilege  is  not
to  be  used  as  a  cloak  for  illegal  or  fraudulent  behavior,  it
is  well-established  that  the  privilege  does  not  apply  where
legal representation was secured in furtherance of intended,
or present, continuing illegality.” United States v. Hodge and
Zweig, 548 F.2d 1347, 1354 (9th Cir.1977). The exception
is  to  be  considered  where  the  government  seeks  disclosure
of information regarding continuing illegality which would
otherwise be covered by the attorney-client privilege. Id. The
exception does not allow prosecutors to ignore altogether the
attorney-client relationship.

  Finally,  the  government's  argument  that

  [30]

  [31]

U.S. v. Marshank, 777 F.Supp. 1507 (1991)
60 USLW 2386
[29]
the defendant waived his conflict of interest with Marshank
by  paying  Booky's  legal  fees  is  absolutely  meritless.  In
situations where there is no conflict of interest, a defendant
may  waive  his  right  to  assistance  of  counsel;  however,
that  waiver  must  be  knowing  and  intelligent.  See  Partin,
601  F.2d  at  1008.  Where  an  attorney  represents  both  a
defendant and a government informant in the same case, the
court  must  disclose  the  potential  conflict  of  interest  to  the
defendant on the record before there can be a knowing and
intelligent waiver. United States v. Levy, 577 F.2d 200, 211
(3d Cir.1978) (citing Holloway v. Arkansas, 435 U.S. 475, 98
S.Ct. 1173, 55 L.Ed.2d 426 (1978)).

Clearly,  there  was  no  knowing  and  intelligent  waiver  by
the  defendant  in  this  case.  Although  Marshank  was  aware
that  Minkin  was  also  representing  Seth  Booky,  he  had  no
knowledge of Booky's activities as a government informant
or  of  Minkin's  role  in  facilitating  those  activities.  Indeed,
Booky,  Minkin  and  the  government  hid  this  information
from Marshank. Nor did the court ever disclose the conflict
of  interest,  as  the  government  never  informed  the  court
of  the  joint  representation  of  Booky  and  Marshank.  As
the  government  was  aware  that  Minkin  was  using  a  “front
attorney”  in  Booky's  case  to  hide  the  conflict  of  interest
problem from the court, the government's suggestion that the
defendant  somehow  waived  his  Sixth  Amendment  right  to
effective assistance of counsel is simply galling.

Therefore,  the  court  finds  that  the  indictment  must  be
DISMISSED under the Sixth Amendment.

  A  court  may  dismiss  an  indictment  for

  [33]

  [34]

III. Supervisory Power
[32]
prosecutorial misconduct either on constitutional grounds
or  by  exercising  its  supervisory  power.  United  States  v.
Carrasco,  786  F.2d  1452,  1455  (9th  Cir.1986).  The  three
legitimate bases for the exercise of the supervisory power are:
(1) to remedy a violation of a statutory or constitutional right;
(2) to preserve judicial integrity; and (3) to deter future illegal
conduct. United States v. Simpson, 927 F.2d 1088, 1090 (9th
Cir.1991) (Simpson II ). The court's supervisory power may
be used to vindicate a defendant's rights, as well as to preserve
judicial integrity and/or to deter illegal or improper conduct.
*1529  United States v. Hasting, 461 U.S. 499, 505, 103 S.Ct.

1974,  1978,  76  L.Ed.2d  96  (1983);  Carrasco,  786  F.2d  at
1455.

The supervisory power has frequently been used by federal
courts as a means of sanctioning and deterring prosecutorial
misconduct. 15   “An  important  function  of  our  supervisory
power is to guarantee that federal prosecutors act with due
regard  for  the  integrity  of  the  administration  of  justice.”
United States v. Basurto, 497 F.2d 781, 793 (9th Cir.1974)
(Hufstedler, J., concurring).

[35]
  It  is  well-established  that  a  federal  court  may  use
its  supervisory  power  to  dismiss  an  indictment  on  the
basis  of  government  misconduct.  United  States  v.  Owen,
580  F.2d  365,  367  (9th  Cir.1978).  “As  such,  dismissal
is  used  as  a  prophylactic  tool  for  discouraging  future
deliberate  governmental  impropriety  of  a  similar  nature.”
Id.;  see  also  United  States  v.  Samango,  607  F.2d  877,
884  (9th  Cir.1979)  (court  exercising  supervisory  power
to  dismiss  indictment  where  cumulative  effect  of  errors
and  prosecutorial  misconduct  was  to  produce  a  biased
grand  jury);  United  States  v.  Isgro,  751  F.Supp.  846,  851
(C.D.Cal.1990)  (court  dismissing  indictment  because  of
prosecutorial misconduct before grand jury).

  While  a  court  may  use  its  supervisory  power

  [37]

[36]
to dismiss an indictment, dismissal is, generally speaking, a
disfavored  remedy.  Rogers,  751  F.2d  at  1076–77.  For  this
reason, a court may dismiss an indictment only in “flagrant”
cases  of  prosecutorial  misconduct.  U.S.  v.  Jacobs,  855
F.2d 652, 655 (9th Cir.1988); Carrasco, 786 F.2d at 1455.
However,  since  this  standard  is  so  vague  that  “it  fails
to  illuminate  the  applicable  legal  principles,  and  provides
district judges who are called upon to apply it precious little
guidance,” U.S. v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., Inc., 719 F.2d 1386,
1391  n.  6  (9th  Cir.1983),  courts  must  determine  when  to
exercise their supervisory power to dismiss an indictment on a
case-by-case basis. United States v. De Rosa, 783 F.2d 1401,
1406 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 477 U.S. 908, 106 S.Ct. 3282,
91 L.Ed.2d 571 (1986).

[38]
  To  warrant  dismissal,  the  government's  misconduct
must not only be flagrant, but must also have prejudiced the
defendant.  Bank  of  Nova  Scotia  v.  United  States,  487  U.S.
250,  254,  108  S.Ct.  2369,  2373,  101  L.Ed.2d  228  (1988).

“where the error is harmless, concerns about the ‘integrity of
the [judicial] process' will carry less weight.” Id. at 255, 108
S.Ct. at 2374 (quoting United States v. Hasting, 461 U.S. at
506, 103 S.Ct. at 1979).

[39]
 It is not necessary to review the government's conduct
in  this  case  yet  again  in  order  to  determine  whether  it  is
appropriate  for  the  court  to  exercise  its  supervisory  power
to  dismiss  the  indictment  against  the  defendant.  The  court
invokes  its  supervisory  power  to  dismiss  the  indictment  in
order  to  remedy  the  violation  of  the  defendant's  Fifth  and
Sixth Amendment rights, to preserve judicial integrity, and to
deter future government misconduct.

The  court's  previous  discussion  makes  clear  the  need  to
remedy the violation of the defendant's constitutional rights
and to deter future government misconduct. With regard to
the preservation of judicial integrity, the court notes that Rule
3–310 of the Rules of Professional Conduct of the State Bar
of California provides in pertinent part:

(B)  A  member  shall  not  concurrently  represent  clients
whose interests conflict, except with their informed written
consent.

....

standards of professional conduct for the Northern District of
California. 16  Rule 3–310 was violated in numerous instances
by Ron Minkin. Judicial integrity is severely threatened when
professional  ethical  and  court  rules  such  as  those  involved
here are flouted by the government.

The  court,  therefore,  DISMISSES  the  indictment  in  the
exercise of its supervisory power. 17

CONCLUSION
The government in this case collaborated with the defendant's
attorney  in  an  effort  to  investigate,  arrest  and  prosecute
the  defendant.  This  collaboration  included  using  some  of
Minkin's  other  clients  as  government  informants  in  the
defendant's  investigation.  The  government's  misconduct  in
this  case  robbed  the  defendant  of  his  right  to  effective
assistance of counsel and his right to due process of law. The
government's actions also displayed a complete disregard for
the professional duty attorneys owe to their clients and for the
ethical obligation prosecutors have as officers of the court.

For  these  reasons  the  court  DISMISSES  the  indictment
against  the  defendant  on  Fifth  Amendment  grounds,  Sixth
Amendment  grounds  and  as  an  exercise  of  the  court's
supervisory power.

*1530   (F)  As  used  in  this  rule  “informed”  means  full
disclosure to the client of the circumstances and advice to
the client of any actual or reasonably foreseeable adverse
effects of those circumstances upon the representation.

This  court,  through  its  Local  Rules,  has  adopted  the  State
Bar's  Rules  of  Professional  Conduct  as  the  applicable

IT IS SO ORDERED.

active informant. RT at 2–312–313, 319–321. Ames, however, testified that he told Robinson of the task force that was
formed at the Los Angeles meetings. RT at 3–589. It is clear that either Ames or Robinson is not telling the truth.

The court is hard pressed to believe that Ames, the case agent, would not have informed Robinson, the AUSA in
charge of the case, of such important developments in the case. However, given that either version of the story reveals
government complicity with Minkin, it unnecessary for the court to resolve the conflict between the witnesses' testimony.
Booky, in his testimony before the second grand jury to indict Marshank, described the moments after his arrest and
leading up to his decision to cooperate with the government as follows:

6

And they took us up to the Santa Rosa Courthouse, down to the police station down there, and everybody was in
separate rooms.
....
And they come in, close the door, and say, “Hello, Mr. Booky, I'm Ed Ames and I'm Peter Robinson.
They said “We would like your help, Mr. Booky. We have this case dead to rights, but we know who you are, and
we'd like your help. We'd like your cooperation, and you could make it easy on yourself if you help us now.”
They said, “We're looking for forfeitures and there's a reward to be had and we're willing to offer those to you if you
make a deal right now. We want your cooperation.”
I said, “Look, I have to talk to my lawyer.”
I said, “I'm not gonna say anything to you guys before I talk to my lawyer.”
So I thought that I'd get on the phone to my lawyer. His name's Ron Minkin.
And I thought he'd tell me, “Seth, don't say anything.”
Because that's what he told me before, because that's what he told me in Hawaii, and that's the general procedure.
....
But I get on the phone to Ron, and he says, “Seth,” he says, “look, there's a lot you don't know.”
He says, “I know a lot you don't know, but I gotta tell you, you're in big trouble and you got no choice.”
He says, “Seth, your life is over.”
He says, “You've got to cooperate with the government.”
Now this came to me—I'm saying, “What?”
I know this guy. He's a lawyer. He's a criminal defense lawyer.
....
I says, “What are you talking about?”
He says, “Don't ask me.”
He says, “As a friend and as your lawyer, you have no choice.”
And I said, “But, Ron, I only got caught—I only got 15 pounds in the car.”
He says, “Seth, you got no choice. You've gotta make up your mind right now.”
From the tone of his voice, there was more to it than I knew. There was just more to it.
And knowing him as being a friend, I knew he cared about me personally, other than a lawyer/client relationship.
He just left me with no options. And right then and there, I made up my mind.
“Yeah,” he says, “look”—
Ron says to me, he says, “Look, Seth, I'll make you the best deal I can.”
He says, “There's rewards that you can have if you lead these guys to forfeitures.”
He says, “You won't do any time.”
He says it like he already had made this deal. And I—
So he says, “Let me talk to those guys,” meaning Ames and Robinson.
So he gets on the phone with Ames and Robinson, and I hear half the conversations, you know. You know, I coudn't
[sic] hear Ron, but I could hear their end.
Actually, I heard Ames say, “Yeah, there's rewards, yeah, Ron,” like he knew Ron, which, you know, I didn't know
what was going on.
Then I hear him talking to Robinson.

“Yeah, Ron, yeah, we'll get him out Monday, him and Moffett.”

Grand Jury Proceedings, Testimony of Seth Booky, March 15, 1990, at 298–32.

Minkin and Booky have brought an action against the government for monies to which they claim they are entitled as
a result of Booky's cooperation in the Marshank investigation and the representation agreement between Booky and
Minkin. RT at 3–657.
Contrary to the testimony of Agent Ames, Robinson testified that he did not know that the defendant provided money to
Minkin for Booky's ostensible defense. The former AUSA testified that had he known about the funds he would not have
allowed Minkin to keep the money. For the same reasons stated in Note five, the court need not resolve this conflicting
testimony. RT at 2–296–297.
Robinson testified that although he spoke to Ames in Florida after Marshank was arrested, the two men never discussed
Minkin's potential conflict of interest. RT at 2–307. Once again, there is no need to resolve the discrepancy between the
testimony of Robinson and the government agent.
The government produced notes taken by agents in conjunction with many of these calls. The notes provide information
regarding the following:

1) calls by Minkin to Yamashita on October 31, 1987, November 9, 1987, November 11, 1987, November 18, 1987,
November 25, 1987, January 6, 1988, and July 17, 1989. Def. Ex. O. There are also ten pages of undated notes
written by Yamashita.
2) calls by Minkin to Heng on August 22, 1989 and March 19, 1990. There are also several pages of undated notes
by Heng.

The  government  attempts  to  distinguish  the  evidence  provided  to  it  by  Minkin  from  that  provided  by  his  cooperating
clients, arguing that only the former is potentially violative of the defendant's constitutional rights. However, the “fruit of
the poisonous tree” doctrine applies to evidence obtained in violation of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel as well
as the Fifth Amendment right to due process. U.S. v. Terzado–Madruga, 897 F.2d 1099, 1113 (11th Cir.1990) (citing
U.S. v. Wade, 388 U.S. 218, 87 S.Ct. 1926, 18 L.Ed.2d 1149 (1967) and Kastigar v. U.S., 406 U.S. 441, 92 S.Ct. 1653,
32 L.Ed.2d 212 (1972)). Therefore, the exclusionary doctrine applies to any incriminating evidence derived from primary
evidence obtained in violation of a defendant's Fifth or Sixth Amendment rights. In light of the fact that the cooperation
of Minkin's clients was a direct result of Minkin's collaboration with the government, use of evidence obtained from these
government informants against Marshank must be deemed violative of the defendant's constitutional rights.
Even members of the grand jury hearing Minkin's testimony in connection with the second indictment had some concerns
about  Minkin's  dual  role.  One  grand  juror  asked  “Didn't  you  feel  that  you  worked  for  the  government  by  giving  the
information from A to B?” Grand Jury 89–3, Testimony of Ron Minkin, June 28, 1990, at 44. Apparently the Grand jury was
not satisfied with the answer because once again a grand juror asked, “So you acted as a government agent by making
sure Mr. Marshank would cooperate and he would be flown home immediately?” Id. at 45. However, before Minkin could
answer the AUSA interrupted and the first part of the question was never answered.
Of the thirteen witnesses to appear before the second grand jury in addition to Booky and Minkin, two (Paul Rozario and
Dan McCurrie) were government agents reading previous testimony of Booky and two (Maura McNulty and Robert Heng)
were government agents relaying information obtained either from Booky or Scott Alexander Moffett. Moffett testified
before the grand jury and retracted any statements he made previously concerning Marshank, stating that he had given
false information to the government under pressure and in the hopes of receiving a lighter sentence for a drug conviction.
Grand Jury 89–3, Testimony of Moffett, at 21–22, 42. Also appearing were Norman Jay Marshank, the defendant's father;
Charles Laver of the Sonoma County Sheriff's Department; John Matheson; Wendy Rothcopf; Kenneth Schatzberg; Burt
McCumber; Joseph Cooper; and Thomis Larson. Norman Marshank provided no incriminating information concerning
the defendant, Grand Jury 89–3, Testimony of Norman Marshank; Laver testified that he knew nothing about Marshank
other than rumors he had heard, Grand Jury 89–3, Testimony of Laver, at 14; Rothcopf testified only that she had met
the defendant socially three or four times, Grand Jury 89–3, Testimony of Rothcopf, at 13; McCumber testified that he
had never met the defendant and did not recognize Marshank's name, Grand Jury 89–3, Testimony of McCumber, at 32;
and Larson provided no testimony concerning the defendant, Grand Jury 89–3, Testimony of Larson.

Matheson,  Schatzberg  and  Cooper  did  provide  some  incriminating  information  concerning  Marshank.  However,  it
appears that only the information supplied by Schatzberg, who was identified to the government by Booky, Grand Jury

89–3, Testimony of Heng, at 73, made its way into the second indictment. See Second Indictment of Steven Marshank,
Overt Acts, para. 31. The overt act contained in the second indictment and testified to by Schatzberg involved a drug
transaction between Booky and Schatzberg; the government learned of this transaction from Booky. Grand Jury 89–3,
Testimony of Heng. It thus appears that the government relied almost exclusively on Booky in formulating its second
indictment against Marshank. Matheson, Schatzberg and Cooper are seemingly “extras” who may have been included
in the grand jury proceedings by the government to mask the prosecution's reliance on Booky.

Indeed, if there was evidence of Minkin's involvement in criminal activity with Marshank, it is curious that the government
never undertook to investigate or prosecute Minkin.
The supervisory power has been used by courts in many contexts, including to reverse a conviction supported by false
evidence, Mesarosh v. United States, 352 U.S. 1, 14, 77 S.Ct. 1, 8, 1 L.Ed.2d 1 (1956); to punish improper practices by
federal attorneys, United States v. Hale, 422 U.S. 171, 180 & n. 7, 95 S.Ct. 2133, 2138 & n. 7, 45 L.Ed.2d 99 (1975);
United States v. Banks, 383 F.Supp. 389, 397 (D.S.D.1974), appeal dismissed sub nom. United States v. Means, 513
F.2d 1329 (8th Cir.1975); and to suppress evidence gained by government agents through misconduct. Mallory v. United
States, 354 U.S. 449, 455–56, 77 S.Ct. 1356, 1359–60, 1 L.Ed.2d 1479 (1957); Rea v. United States, 350 U.S. 214,
217–18, 76 S.Ct. 292, 294, 100 L.Ed. 233 (1956).
U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, Local Rule 110–3.
In  determining  if  government  actions  are  sufficiently  egregious  to  warrant  dismissal  as  a  means  of  deterring  future
misconduct, courts often have been guided by two considerations. First, courts have looked to whether there is a pattern
of similar government misconduct, on the theory that such widespread misconduct increases the threat to judicial integrity.
See, e.g., United States v. Griffith, 756 F.2d 1244, 1249 (6th Cir.1985), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 837, 106 S.Ct. 114, 88
L.Ed.2d 93 (1985); United States v. Rosenfield, 780 F.2d 10, 11 (3d Cir.1985), cert. denied, 478 U.S. 1004, 106 S.Ct.
3294, 92 L.Ed.2d 709 (1986). Second, courts have looked to whether there is any alternative remedy which the court
may effectively use as a means of deterrence. Bank of Nova Scotia, 487 U.S. at 255, 108 S.Ct. at 2374; Simpson II, 927
F.2d at 1091–92 (Nelson, J., concurring).

Because the court invokes its supervisory power in part to remedy the violation of the defendant's constitutional rights,
and in part because it has already been determined that nothing short of dismissal will remedy this violation, the court
need not consider the extent to which the government's misconduct here is part of a larger pattern.

REVERSE.

I.

A.

Terry  and  Lorraine  Brown  (collectively  “the  Browns”)
became  Drug  Enforcement  Administration 
(“DEA”)
informants in July 1988, subsequent to Terry Brown's arrest
for  the  purchase  of  one  kilogram  of  cocaine  from  Pepe
(defendant's  former  boyfriend)  and  defendant  on  March  8,
1988.

On February 13, 1989, while in custody, the Browns began
making a series of DEA controlled, tape recorded, telephone
calls  to  defendant.  The  first  call  concerned  the  delivery  of
three  to  five  kilograms  of  cocaine  to  northern  Kentucky
and the price of the cocaine. During a subsequent telephone

conversation, defendant informed the Browns that the price
would  be  $19,500  per  kilogram  of  cocaine.  The  series  of
recorded telephone conversations, which took place over the
following  weeks,  detailed  defendant's  involvement  in  the
narcotics  *1148   industry,  the  problems  she  encountered
locating  cocaine,  and  how  she  planned  to  fill  the  Browns'
order for four kilograms of cocaine.

On March 19, 1989, defendant flew to Cincinnati from Miami
to  complete  the  transaction.  The  Browns  met  her  at  the
airport and transported her to the Holiday Inn in Covington,
Kentucky,  where  they  rented  a  room.  Shortly  thereafter,
Francisco Gomez (“Gomez”) arrived at the hotel. Gomez had
driven the cocaine from the New York City area to Covington.
Terry Brown, Gomez and defendant went outside to Gomez'
vehicle,  retrieved  the  four  kilograms  of  cocaine,  brought  it
back to the hotel room, and examined it. DEA agents then
entered the hotel room and arrested Gomez and defendant.

B.

On April 12, 1989, defendant and Gomez were indicted on
seven counts, including conspiracy to distribute cocaine, in
violation of 21 U.S.C. § 846; attempt to distribute cocaine,
in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 846; interstate travel to facilitate
narcotics activity, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1952; and use
of a telephone to facilitate narcotics activity, in violation of
21  U.S.C.  §  843(b).  Gomez  pled  guilty  to  all  charges  on
September  11,  1989.  Defendant  pled  not  guilty.  Her  trial
commenced September 12, 1989, and concluded September
19, 1989.

At trial, during closing argument, the Assistant United States
Attorney  (“Assistant  U.S.  Attorney”  or  the  “prosecutor”)
made the following remarks:

[Assistant  U.S.  Attorney]:  What  you're  listening  to  is  a

Transcript  at  767–68  (emphasis  added).  The  court  did  not
immediately admonish the jury, but instead declared a recess.
Out  of  the  presence  of  the  jury,  the  court  allowed  defense
counsel to state his objection to the prosecutor's comment on
closing. Defense counsel at that time also moved for a mistrial
based on the prosecutor's highly prejudicial comments. The
court  sustained  the  objection  but  denied  the  motion  for  a
mistrial. 1  The court stated  *1149  that it would admonish
the jury when court resumed, which it did, stating:

At  the  conclusion  ...  certain  remarks  were  made  in  the
closing  argument  of  the  prosecutor  to  which  the  Court
has  sustained  an  objection  and  will  admonish  you  not
to  consider  them.  Do  not  consider  any  urgings  by  the
prosecutor to send messages to anybody. We're not here
to  send  messages  to  anybody.  We're  here  to  try  this
defendant's case.

It's our duty to try—try this defendant's case based on
the evidence in this case and the law in this case and not
with concern about anybody else. The Court reiterates
its instructions that if the evidence establishes beyond
a  reasonable  doubt  that  the  defendant  is  guilty  of  the
offense  as  charged  or  any  of  them  its  your  duty  to
convict. If the United States fails to meet that burden, it's
your duty to acquit. Don't worry about anybody else or
send anybody any messages. We're concerned with this
one case to try [defendant] on the evidence in it.

Transcript at 768.

The  jury  returned  a  verdict  of  guilty  on  all  counts.  On
March  28,  1990,  defendant  was  sentenced  to  151–months
imprisonment. Defendant filed a timely notice of appeal on
March 28, 1990.

II.

A.

On appeal, defendant argues that, during closing argument,
the  prosecutor  made  improper  and  prejudicial  statements
which  deprived  her  of  a  fair  trial.  Defendant  contends  that
the prosecutor's argument constitutes reversible error because
the resulting prejudice was not cured by the district court's
subsequent admonition to the jury. The prosecutor's remarks,
defendant argues, were prejudicial because they improperly
appealed  to  the  community  conscience  and  interest  of  the
jurors  in  ridding  society  of  drug  dealers.  The  prosecutor
counters that its comments, if improper, were cured by the
district court's admonition.

B.

We  review  the  district  court's  denial  of  defendant's  motion
for a mistrial for abuse of discretion. See   *1150  Illinois v.
Somerville, 410 U.S. 458, 462–64, 93 S.Ct. 1066, 1069–70,
35 L.Ed.2d 425 (1973); United States v. Cordell, 924 F.2d
614, 617 (6th Cir.1991) (citing United States v. Levy, 904 F.2d
1026, 1030 (6th Cir.1990), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 1091, 111
S.Ct. 974, 112 L.Ed.2d 1060 (1991)).

In the case before us, the question of whether the district court
abused its discretion in turn depends on whether the conduct
of  the  prosecutor  constitutes  reversible  error.  Cf.  United
States v. Alloway, 397 F.2d 105, 113 (6th Cir.1968) (no abuse
of discretion shown in denying motion for a mistrial where
prosecutor's argument was not found to warrant reversal). In
making  this  determination,  we  consider  whether  there  was
misconduct.  If  there  was  misconduct,  we  must  determine
whether the misconduct was harmless. See United States v.
Bess, 593 F.2d 749, 756–57 (6th Cir.1979) (determining first
that  the  conduct  complained  of,  the  prosecutor's  statement
of personal belief of the defendant's guilt, constituted error
and then determining that such conduct constituted reversible
error).

[1]
  Thus,  this  Court  must  determine  whether  defendant's
right to a fair trial was prejudiced by improper prosecutorial
conduct. There are instances where a “single misstep” on the

part of the prosecutor may be so destructive of the right to a
fair trial that reversal is mandated. See Pierce v. United States,
86 F.2d 949 (6th Cir.1936). We realize that such instances
may  be  rare,  but  we  believe  this  case  exemplifies  a  single
misstep so destructive to defendant's right to a fair trial that it
constitutes reversible error.

C.

1.

This Circuit has many times expressed itself fully on the issue
of misconduct of government counsel in the prosecution of
criminal  cases.  Our  decisions  in  this  area  have  recognized
the  standard  of  conduct  imposed  upon  the  prosecution  of
federal  crimes  as  enunciated  in  Berger  v.  United  States,
295  U.S.  78,  55  S.Ct.  629,  79  L.Ed.  1314  (1935).  See,
e.g.,  Bess,  593  F.2d  at  756–57.  In  Berger,  the  Supreme
Court considered an instance of prosecutorial misconduct
involving both improper cross examination of witnesses and
improper argument to the jury in a prosecution for conspiracy
to utter counterfeit notes.  Berger, 295 U.S. at 79–80, 55 S.Ct.
at  629–30.  The  Supreme  Court  found  that  the  prosecutor's
conduct rose to the level of prejudicial misconduct because
his argument to the jury was undignified and intemperate. The
argument was found to have contained improper insinuations
and  assertions  calculated  to  mislead  the  jury.  Id.  at  85,  55
S.Ct.  at  632.  Because  the  jury  will  normally  place  great
confidence  in  the  faithful  execution  of  the  obligations  of  a
prosecuting  attorney,  improper  insinuations  or  suggestions
are  apt  to  carry  more  weight  against  a  defendant  than
such  statements  by  witnesses.  The  Supreme  Court  stated
the  following  in  asserting  that  the  conduct  of  government
prosecutors must meet a high standard:

The  United  States  Attorney  is  the
representative not of an ordinary party
to a controversy, but of a sovereignty
whose obligation to govern impartially
is  as  compelling  as  its  obligation  to
govern  at  all;  and  whose  interest,
therefore, in a criminal prosecution is
not  that  it  shall  win  a  case,  but  that
justice  shall  be  done.  As  such,  he  is
in  a  peculiar  and  very  definite  sense

the servant of the law, the twofold aim
of which is that guilt shall not escape
or innocence suffer. He may prosecute
with vigor—indeed, he should do so.
But, while he may strike hard blows,
he  is  not  at  liberty  to  strike  foul
ones. It is as much his duty to refrain
from  improper  methods  calculated  to
produce a wrongful conviction as it is
to use every legitimate means to bring
about a just one.

Id. at 88–89, 55 S.Ct. at 633.

Thus,  it  is  the  duty  of  the  prosecutor  to  advance  the
government's cause with force and persuasiveness. However,
this duty encompasses concerns beyond mere advocacy. The
prosecutor has a concomitant duty not to derogate from a fair
and impartial criminal proceeding. Stated in slightly different
terms, the government's conduct  *1151  in prosecuting the
defendant  may  determine  whether  or  not  a  defendant  is
accorded  his  or  her  constitutional  right  to  a  fair  trial.  Cf.
Viereck  v.  United  States,  318  U.S.  236,  247–48,  63  S.Ct.
561, 566, 87 L.Ed. 734 (1943) (finding that the prosecutor's
conduct  prejudiced  the  defendant's  right  to  a  fair  trial  and
was  “offensive  to  the  dignity  and  good  order  with  which
all  proceedings  in  court  should  be  conducted”  and  quoting
language in Berger, 295 U.S. at 88, 55 S.Ct. at 633, which
stressed that the role of the prosecutor in a criminal case is to
see that justice is done); Bess, 593 F.2d at 755 (stating that
prosecutors carry a special aura of legitimacy).

In  sum,  the  principles  set  forth  in  Berger  forbid  the
government's  injection  of  improper  or  prejudicial  material
that deprives an accused of his or her right to a fair trial. For
instance, the government prosecutor may not express to the
jury his or her personal knowledge of the guilt of the accused,
Bess, 593 F.2d at 754, or bring to the jury's attention purported
facts that are not in evidence and are prejudicial, United States
v. Leon, 534 F.2d 667, 679 (6th Cir.1976) (citing Berger, 295
U.S. at 88, 55 S.Ct. at 633).

conscience  are  not  per  se  impermissible.  See  Henderson  v.
United  States,  218  F.2d  14,  19–20  (6th  Cir.),  cert.  denied,
349  U.S.  920,  75  S.Ct.  660,  99  L.Ed.  1253  (1955). 2   Our
determination of whether comments are calculated to incite
prejudice and passion in the jury is informed by the Supreme
Court opinion in Viereck.

Eight  years  after  the  Berger  decision,  in  Viereck,  the
Supreme  Court  considered  the  propriety  of  a  prosecutor's
closing argument which appealed to the national or patriotic
community interest of the jurors during World War II. The
petitioner had been convicted for willfully omitting a material
fact  in  a  registration  form  filed  by  him  with  the  Secretary
of State. The Secretary of State required the registration of
certain  agents  of  foreign  principals.  The  Secretary  of  State
also  required  disclosure  of  the  terms  and  conditions  of  the
agents' contracts with foreign principals. Viereck, 318 U.S. at
237–38, 63 S.Ct. at 561–62.

At a time when the United States was participating in World
War  II,  the  Supreme  Court  found  that  statements  by  the
prosecutor regarding jurors' patriotism constituted an appeal
wholly irrelevant to any facts or issues in the case, the purpose
and effect of which could have only been to arouse passion
and  prejudice.  While  the  Supreme  Court  reversed  on  the
grounds of a different error, the Court explicitly stated that
it thought the prosecutor's conduct prejudiced the petitioner's
right to a fair trial and that, independent of the error for which
the  conviction  was  reversed,  the  conduct  might  well  have
placed the judgment  *1152  of conviction in jeopardy. The
remarks found prejudicial were as follows:

In closing, let me remind you, ladies and gentlemen, that
this is war. This is war, harsh, cruel, murderous war. There
are those who, right at this very moment, are plotting your
death and my death; plotting our death and the death of our
families because we have committed no other crime than
that  we  do  not  agree  with  their  ideas  of  persecution  and
concentration camps.

This  is  war.  It  is  a  fight  to  the  death.  The  American
people are relying upon you ladies and gentlemen for their
protection against this sort of crime, just as much as they
are relying upon the protection of the men who man the
guns in Bataan Peninsula, and everywhere else. They are
relying upon you ladies and gentlemen for their protection.
We are at war. You have a duty to perform here.

As a representative of your Government I am calling upon
every one of you to do your duty.

Id. at 247 n. 3, 63 S.Ct. at 566 n. 3.

[3]
  The  remarks  in  the  instant  case  are  analogous  to
the  comments  adjudged  inflammatory  and  prejudicial  in
Viereck.  The  fairness  or  unfairness  of  comments  appealing
to  the  national  or  local  community  interests  of  jurors  in
a  given  instance  will  depend  in  great  part  on  the  nature
of  the  community  interest  appealed  to,  and  its  relationship
to,  and  the  nature  of,  the  wider  social-political  context  to
which  it  refers.  The  correlation  between  the  community
interest  comments  and  the  wider  social-political  context  to
a  large  extent  controls  the  determination  of  whether  an
appeal  is  deemed  impermissible  because  it  is  calculated
to  inflame  passion  and  prejudice.  The  Supreme  Court  in
Viereck framed the inquiry to incorporate both the purpose
and  effect  of  the  comments.  In  that  case,  in  the  light  of
contemporaneous  events,  which  had  great  impact  on  the
emotions and perceptions of jurors, the remarks “could only
have ... arouse[d] passion and prejudice.” See id. at 247, 63
S.Ct. at 566.

In  United  States  v.  Barker,  553  F.2d  1013,  1024–25  (6th
Cir.1977),  in  reviewing  a  conviction  for  bank  robbery,
we  considered  remarks  which  were  found  to  have  been
deliberately made. These remarks were: “[I]f you can't take
this evidence and find these defendants guilty on this evidence
that  [sic]  we  might  as  well  open  all  the  banks  and  say,
‘Come on and get the money, boys, because we'll never be
able  to  convict  them.’  ”  Id.  at  1025.  We  determined  that
it  was  beyond  the  bounds  of  propriety  for  a  prosecutor  to
suggest  that  unless  the  defendant  was  convicted  it  would
be  impossible  to  maintain  “law  and  order”  in  the  jurors'
community. Id. 3

The D.C. Circuit has applied this principle prohibiting appeals
which are inflammatory in the contemporary climate to pleas
against  the  drug  problem  in  the  ongoing  drug  war.  United
States v. Hawkins, 595 F.2d 751 (D.C.Cir.1978), cert. denied,
441 U.S. 910, 99 S.Ct. 2005, 60 L.Ed.2d 380 (1979). The D.C.
Circuit stated that prosecutors are not “at liberty to substitute
emotion for evidence by equating, directly or by innuendo, a
verdict of guilty to a blow against the drug problem.” Id. at
754.

cert. denied, 470 U.S. 1085, 105 S.Ct. 1847, 85 L.Ed.2d 146
(1985), condemning appeals to the community interest to end
a societal evil:

lurking 

A  prosecutor  may  not  urge  jurors
to  convict  a  criminal  defendant  in
order  to  protect  community  values,
preserve  civil  order,  or  deter  future
lawbreaking.  The  evil 
in
such  prosecutorial  appeals  is  that
the  defendant  will  be  convicted  for
reasons  wholly  irrelevant  to  his  own
guilt  or  innocence.  Jurors  may  be
persuaded by such appeals to believe
that,  by  convicting  a  defendant,
they  will  assist  in  the  solution  of
some  pressing  social  problem.  The
amelioration  of  society's  woes  is  far
too heavy a burden for the individual
criminal defendant to bear.

Id. at 1441.

[5]
  In  the  instant  case,  we  examine  closely  the  substance
of  the  prosecutor's  statements  to  determine  whether  they
were calculated to inflame. Our determination will depend on
whether the statements appeal to community interests in light
of current events and the nature of the specific case. In the
case before us, the effect of the prosecutor's comments was to
suggest to the jury that, because of defendant's participation
in  the  drug  trade  in  northern  Kentucky,  the  drug  problem
facing the jurors' community would continue if they did not
convict  her.  It  is  error  for  a  prosecutor  to  direct  the  jurors'

desires to end a social problem toward convicting a particular
defendant.

Even though this nation is in the midst of an ongoing crisis,
popularly  termed  the  “War  on  Drugs,”  this  crisis  does  not
create an excuse to impinge on the constitutional right to a
fair trial. We repeat what we stated in United States v. Radka,
904 F.2d 357 (6th Cir.1990):

Presently,  our  nation 
is  plagued
with  the  destructive  effects  of  the
illegal  importation  and  distribution
of  drugs.  At  this  critical  time,  our
Constitution remains a lodestar for the
protections that shall endure the most
pernicious  affronts  to  our  society....
The  drug  crisis  does  not  license
the  aggrandizement  of  governmental
power 
liberties.
Despite 
the  devastation  wrought
by  drug  trafficking  in  communities
nationwide,  we  cannot  suspend  the
precious  rights  guaranteed  by  the
Constitution  in  an  effort  to  fight  the
“War on Drugs.”

in 

Id.  at  361  (reversing  a  denial  of  a  defendant's  motion
to  suppress  evidence  obtained  in  a  warrantless  search
of  defendant's  home  because 
there  were  no  exigent
circumstances).  Here,  defendant's  constitutional  right  to  a
fair trial was violated because the appeal to the community
conscience in the context of the War on Drugs prejudicially
impacted  on  her.  The  fear  surrounding  the  War  on  Drugs
undoubtedly  influenced  the  jury  by  diverting  its  attention
away  from  its  task  to  weigh  the  evidence  and  submit  a
reasoned decision finding defendant guilty or innocent of the
crimes  with  which  she  was  charged.  The  substance  of  the
statements made by the prosecutor in this case were designed,
both in purpose and effect, to arouse passion and prejudice
and  to  inflame  the  jurors'  emotions  regarding  the  War  on
Drugs by urging them to send a message and strike a blow to
the drug problem.

This  nation  faces  a  variety  of  social  problems  with  which
all  citizens  are  daily  confronted.  The  drug  problem  is  one
of  the  most  compelling  and  devastating  problems  faced
by  this  nation  today.  This  Court  is  acutely  aware  of  the

nature and extent of the drug problem. However, government
prosecutors  are  not  at  liberty  to  urge  jurors  to  convict
defendants as blows to the drug problem faced by society or
specifically, within their communities, or to send messages
to  all  drug  dealers.  Such  appeals  are  extremely  prejudicial
and harmful  *1154  to the constitutional right to a fair trial.
It should be clear from the foregoing discussion that, while
not causing error per se unless the statements are deemed to
be calculated to incite prejudice, prosecutors should exercise
extreme caution when making any statement referring to the
community interests of jurors.

The  government  relies  on  United  States  v.  Alloway,  397
F.2d 105 (6th Cir.1968), to provide an example of a similar
instance of comments directed to the community conscience
of  jurors.  In  Alloway  we  reviewed  a  conviction  for  armed
robbery  of  a  Federal  Savings  &  Loan  Association.  The
defendant asserted that improper argument by the prosecutor
should have resulted in a mistrial. We held that the following
statements by the prosecutor did not exceed the permissible
bounds of advocacy and that therefore the district court did
not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's motion for a
mistrial:

You,  the  jurors,  are  called  upon  in
this  case  to  be  the  world  conscience
of  the  community.  And  I'm  calling
on  this  jury  to  speak  out  for  the
community and let the John Alloways
know that this type of conduct will not
be  tolerated,  that  we're  not  going  to
tolerate [armed robbery]....

397 F.2d at 113. The district court in Alloway subsequently
instructed the jury to base its verdict solely on the evidence
and  to  consider  the  prosecutor's  argument  only  as  it
corresponded with the evidence. Id.

The  comments  by  the  prosecutor  in  Alloway  and  the
comments complained of in the instant case are only vaguely
similar. The remarks in this case appear to us to have been
deliberately  injected  into  the  proceedings  to  incite  the  jury
against  defendant.  Given  the  nature  of  this  case,  involving
a  cocaine  transaction,  and  the  wider  social  context  which
the  prosecutor  sought  to  bring  to  bear  on  the  proceedings,
the  national  drug  problem,  the  purpose  and  effect  of  the
comments  could  have  only  been  to  arouse  passion  and

prejudice.  See  Viereck,  318  U.S.  at  247,  63  S.Ct.  at  566.
We  determined  that  the  statements  made  in  Alloway  were
not deliberately injected into the proceedings to inflame the
jury. See 397 F.2d at 113. Indeed, examined in the light of
the nature of the case and the wider social context in which
the  case  was  prosecuted,  it  is  clear  that  the  government's
statements in Alloway were devoid of the sort of inflammatory
content  inherent  in  the  prosecutor's  statements  in  this  case
precisely  because  there  was  no  comparable  specific  wider
context of national attention and concern present in Alloway
pertaining to armed robbery. The comments in Alloway did
not attempt to compare or to associate the defendant with a
feared and highly publicized group, such as drug dealers, as
did  the  prosecutor  in  this  case.  The  prosecutor  in  Alloway
did  not  go  beyond  a  mere  allusion  to  the  general  need  to
convict guilty people, as did the prosecutor in this case, and
bring to bear upon the jury's deliberations the attendant social
consequences of defendant's criminal conduct or urge the jury
to convict an individual defendant in an effort to ameliorate
society's woes.

Here,  the  prosecutor  honed  in  on  the  illegal  drug  trade,
which  is  the  specific  focus  of  much  national  attention,
concern and fear. Thus, in Alloway, we were not presented
with  a  context  similar  to  the  context  of  the  case  before  us
now. This case involves a woman charged with possession
of  cocaine  with  intent  to  distribute  cocaine,  among  other
charges.  The  wider  social,  political  reality  into  which  the
prosecutor  impermissibly  sought  to  insert  the  case  is  the
highly publicized, national and international drug trade. The
prosecutor brought to bear upon the jury's decision whether
to  convict  defendant  the  pervasive  fear  of  drugs  and  the
attendant  dangers  of  drugs  and  drug  addiction.  The  almost
daily attention given by the media and politicians to the drug
trade  and  gang  violence,  for  example,  have  heightened  the
nation's awareness of, and hardened its attitudes towards, the
drug  problem.  Thus,  the  prosecutor's  appeal  to  the  jury  to
convict  a  defendant  as  a  blow  to  the  drug  problem  or  to
send  messages  to  drug  dealers  cannot  be  other  than  highly
prejudicial given the specific context of the case in the current
social-political environment.

*1155  In Alloway, we were presented with remarks by the
prosecutor which alluded only to the general criminality of
the  defendant's  conduct  in  robbing  a  bank  and  the  general
community  need  to  convict  guilty  people.  The  comments
at  issue  in  Alloway  constituted  a  general  plea  which  did

not  even  specifically  refer  to  the  crime  of  armed  robbery.
Moreover, armed robbery was not and is not the specific focus
of  national  attention  as  is  the  drug  problem.  In  the  instant
case, we find that Alloway is inapposite because, in this case,
the  prosecutor  went  beyond  the  scope  of  the  prosecutor's
statements in Alloway, which constituted a mere innocuous
reference to the community or societal need to convict guilty
people. The prosecutor in the instant case went beyond stating
the  obvious,  and  went  so  far  as  to  urge  the  jury  to  send  a
message to the community, to defendant and “all of the drug
dealers  like  her”  by  convicting  defendant.  The  prosecutor
suggested to the jury that convicting defendant would help
keep  its  community  in  northern  Kentucky  free  of  the  drug
trade by sending the message that “we don't want that stuff
in  Northern  Kentucky  and  that  anybody  who  brings  that
stuff ...” presumably would be convicted just like defendant
in  this  case.  We  determine  that  the  prosecutor  improperly
injected the spectre of an influx of cocaine dealers into the
jurors'  community  in  an  attempt  to  appeal  to  the  jurors'
emotions, passions and prejudices against the drug problem.
See  generally  United  States  v.  Love,  534  F.2d  87,  89  (6th
Cir.1976)  (finding  reversible  misconduct  where  prosecutor
intentionally and for no legitimate purpose injected into the
trial the spectre of organized crime and the Mafia).

Thus,  we  conclude  that  the  complained  of  remarks  by
the  prosecutor  in  this  case  constitute  error.  The  remarks
were  isolated  to  one  portion  of  the  trial,  closing  argument.
However,  this  fact  does  not  ameliorate  their  prejudicial
impact;  the  remarks  were  misleading,  inflammatory  and
prejudiced defendant's right to a fair trial.

1.

[6]
 Having determined that the prosecutor's remarks were
prejudicial  to  defendant's  right  to  a  fair  trial  and  thus
constituted error, we now turn to examine whether such error
was harmless.

[7]
 Our review of a claim of prosecutorial misconduct on
appeal  is  guided  by  the  standards  set  forth  in  Chapman  v.
California, 386 U.S. 18, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967),
to determine whether constitutional error is harmless error or

whether reversible error has resulted from improper evidence
or improper argument to the jury. In Chapman, the Supreme
Court  held  that  errors  at  trial,  even  federal  constitutional
errors,  do  not  require  automatic  reversal  of  a  conviction  if
the error can be classified as harmless. It is incumbent upon
the government to demonstrate that such constitutional error,
resulting from the admission of highly prejudicial evidence
or comment, is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Id. at 24,
87 S.Ct. at 828. If there is a reasonable possibility that the
evidence or comment complained of might have contributed
to the conviction, then such error cannot be harmless beyond a
reasonable doubt. See id. at 23–24, 87 S.Ct. at 827–28 (relying
on Fahy v. Connecticut, 375 U.S. 85, 84 S.Ct. 229, 11 L.Ed.2d
171  (1963));  Coury  v.  Livesay,  868  F.2d  842,  845–46  (6th
Cir.1989) (applying the Chapman harmless error analysis to
determine whether the error affected the result).

[8]
 The result of a harmless error analysis depends on the
circumstances  of  the  particular  case.  Phelps  v.  Duckworth,
772  F.2d  1410,  1413  (7th  Cir.)  (en  banc),  cert.  denied,
474  U.S.  1011,  106  S.Ct.  541,  88  L.Ed.2d  471  (1985);
United States v. Shue, 766 F.2d 1122, 1132 (7th Cir.1985).
Determining  whether  an  error  is  reversible  necessitates
examination of the entire record. See United States v. Hasting,
461  U.S.  499,  509,  103  S.Ct.  1974,  1980,  76  L.Ed.2d  96
(1983).  Hasting  reiterated  the  Supreme  Court's  recognition
that  “given  the  myriad  safeguards  provided  to  assure  a
fair  trial,  and  taking  into  account  the  reality  of  the  human
fallibility of the participants, there can be no such thing as an
*1156  error free, perfect trial, and that the Constitution does
not guarantee such a trial.” Id. at 508–09, 103 S.Ct. at 1980.

2.

[9]
 The government urges us to find that the prosecutor's
comments were fair comment based upon the evidence and
were cured by an admonition from the trial judge.

Prosecutorial  missteps  have  been  held  harmless  in  light  of
the relative strength of the evidence or because instructions
given by the trial court sufficiently diluted or eradicated any
resulting prejudice. See United States v. Hawkins, 595 F.2d
751, 754–55 (D.C.Cir.1978), cert. denied, 441 U.S. 910, 99
S.Ct. 2005, 60 L.Ed.2d 380 (1979). Regardless of the strength
of the case against defendant, the instructions given by the

district court were insufficient and came too late to mitigate
the negative and highly prejudicial impact of the remarks on
the jurors' minds, especially since the remarks were among
the  final  arguments  presented  to  the  jurors  prior  to  their
deliberations.

[10]
  When  isolated  remarks  are  made  in  the  course  of  a
long  trial  and  the  jury  is  given  an  appropriate  cautionary
instruction designed to overcome any prejudice that may have
been  caused,  the  error  may  be  harmless.  We  examine  the
curative effect, if any, of the cautionary instruction to the jury
in the light of the degree and effect of the prejudice. However,
an error may be so prejudicial that no cautionary instruction,
however swiftly and forcibly given, can safely eradicate its
effect. See Pierce v. United States, 86 F.2d 949, 952–53 (6th
Cir.1936).

In  Pierce,  we  articulated  the  method  for  testing  prejudice
where  a  cautionary  instruction  has  been  given  to  a  jury
because of improper argument by a prosecutor:

The  inquiry  ...  must  always  be  as  to
whether  in  view  of  the  whole  record
the impression conveyed to the minds
of jurors by irrelevant and prejudicial
matter is such that the court may fairly
say  that  it  has  not  been  successfully
eradicated  by  the  rulings  of  the  trial
judge, his admonition to counsel, and
his instruction to the jurors to disregard
it.

Id. at 952. Similarly, in Ippolito v. United States, 108 F.2d
668,  670–71  (6th  Cir.1940),  we  stated  that  “appeals  to  the
passion and prejudice of a jury,” while constituting error, do
not require reversal unless such error affects the substantial
rights of parties. Id. at 670. We recognized, as we do here,
that  a  single  instance  of  error  may  be  so  destructive  of  a
defendant's right to a fair trial that reversal must follow. Id.
at 671.

In  United  States  v.  Ashworth,  836  F.2d  260,  267  (6th
Cir.1988), we adopted the Ninth Circuit's analysis in United
States  v.  Flake,  746  F.2d  535  (9th  Cir.1984),  cert.  denied,
469 U.S. 1225, 105 S.Ct. 1220, 84 L.Ed.2d 360 (1985). The
Flake  court  framed  the  question  of  whether  a  new  trial  is
warranted as whether improprieties in counsel's argument to

the jury were so gross as to probably prejudice the defendant
and whether any resulting prejudice was not neutralized by
the  trial  judge's  instruction  or  admonition  to  the  jury.  Id.
at  542.  The  court  in  Flake  found  that  improprieties  in  the
prosecutor's  argument  to  the  jury  were  improper  but  not
gross, and in any case were followed swiftly by the court's
admonition and the prosecutor's apology and personal request
that the jury heed the court's instructions. Ashworth involved
an  appeal  from  the  defendants'  convictions  for  conspiracy
and arson. The  Ashworth court applied the  Flake approach
to  determine  whether  prejudice  resulted  from  improper
prosecutorial comment on a fact not in evidence and whether
such comment was cured by an admonition from the court.
In  argument  to  the  jury,  the  prosecutor  referred  to  prior
statements by two co-defendants to the effect that they denied
talking  to  each  other  on  the  night  of  the  fire.  On  appeal,
we  concluded  that  the  prosecutor's  comment  was  not  so
gross  as  to  probably  prejudice  the  defendants  and  that  any
slight  prejudice  resulting  from  the  improper  argument  was
neutralized  by  the  court's  cautionary  instruction  to  the  jury
that the attorneys' arguments were not evidence. Ashworth,
836 F.2d at 267.

*1157   In  this  case,  we  find  the  comments  made  by  the
prosecutor  during  closing  argument  to  have  been  so  gross
as  to  probably  prejudice  defendant.  We  also  find  that  the
trial  court's  admonition  to  the  jury  did  not  neutralize  the
prejudice  resulting  from  such  comments.  Therefore,  we
cannot conclude that there is no reasonable possibility that the
comments did not contribute to defendant's conviction.

[11]
  Both  the  timing  and  the  firmness  of  the  trial  court's
admonition are relevant in evaluating whether an admonition
has been sufficient to mitigate prejudicial error. In Bess we
found  the  timing  of  the  trial  judge's  admonition  relevant.
In finding improper remarks by the prosecutor to constitute
reversible  error,  we  noted  that  the  objectionable  remarks
were promptly objected to, but that the trial judge failed to
give an immediate curative admonition. 593 F.2d at 757. In
Bess  we  stressed  that  corrective  measures  should  be  taken
immediately  in  instances  of  prosecutorial  misconduct  so
as  to  ameliorate  any  resulting  prejudice.  Id.  at  757  n.  10.
While the trial judge in this case did admonish the jury, the
admonition given to the jury took place after a twenty-minute
recess which occurred immediately following the prosecutor's
improper  statements.  As  the  defense  counsel  stated,  these
comments were allowed to become “etched in granite” in the

jurors' minds. The admonition given by the district court in
this case was given too late to eradicate the prejudice from
the jurors' minds. Moreover, the misconduct which took place
in  the  instant  case  “called  for  stern  rebuke  and  repressive
measures.” Berger v. United States, 295 U.S. 78, 85, 55 S.Ct.
629, 632, 79 L.Ed. 1314 (1935). In cases where an admonition
has been found to mitigate or remove the taint of prejudicial
prosecutorial misconduct, the admonition has been swiftly
given  and  firm.  See  Phelps  v.  Duckworth,  772  F.2d  1410,
1413–14  (7th  Cir.)  (en  banc),  cert.  denied,  474  U.S.  1011,
106 S.Ct. 541, 88 L.Ed.2d 471 (1985). In Phelps, the jury was
admonished  twice  to  correct  the  prejudicial  statements.  Id.
Moreover, in Phelps, the jury was admonished immediately.
The  admonition  in  this  case  was  neither  swiftly  given  nor
did  it  sufficiently  convey  to  the  jury  a  sense  of  judicial
disapproval  of  the  remarks  to  dispel  the  harmful  content
and  impact  of  the  prosecutor's  egregious  statements.  Even
were the district court to have immediately and appropriately
admonished  the  jury  to  disregard  the  remarks,  we  doubt
seriously  that  any  cautionary  instruction  could  have  safely
eradicated  the  highly  prejudicial  effect  of  the  prosecutor's
statements  in  this  case.  The  statements  were  deliberately
injected into the proceedings to inflame the jurors' emotions
and  fears  associated  with  the  current  drug  epidemic  that  is
reported  daily  in  our  newspapers  and  which  threatens  the
very  fabric  of  our  society.  Cf.  United  States  v.  Love,  534

F.2d  87,  89  (6th  Cir.1976)  (finding  the  trial  judge's  effort
to  neutralize  prejudicial  government  comments  ineffective
and  reversing  the  defendant's  conviction  where  prosecutor
intentionally injected into the trial the spectre of organized
crime and the Mafia). The statements were so inflammatory
in the context of the ongoing drug war that no charge could
have sufficiently cured the prejudice.

In the instant case, we cannot say that the government has
demonstrated, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the prejudicial
comments  did  not  contribute  to  the  defendant's  conviction.
As we have stated previously, “[d]ue process does not require
perfect trials but it mandates fair ones.” Love, 534 F.2d at 89.

Because  we 
misconduct  which  occurred  in  this  case  did  not  constitute

Footnotes

The trial transcript reveals that the following dialogue took place out of the presence of the jury immediately after the
Assistant U.S. Attorney concluded his closing argument:

The Court: All right. You have a—state your motion and your objection.
[Defense Counsel]: Your Honor, comes now the defendant Rosalba Solivan and based on counsel's comment in
closing argument with respect to her other activities and the drug business of which there's no significant—
The Court: Can't hear you.
[Defense Counsel]: —of which there's no significance or substantial evidence, as well as his last comment, and that
to send a message to the other drug dealers in Northern Kentucky that's clearly an appeal to the community interest
of this jury. It is extremely predudicial to make that type of comment that you have to lock her up and send a message.
It's kind of like giving a punitive damage argument in a straight negligence case, this send-a-message type argument.
It's extremely prejudicial given the nature of the publicity about Columbia, the nature of the political situation, the—the
repeated references in the newspapers, in the media to the drug problem, the President's speech on drugs. A gallup
poll has shown that [for] the majority of Americans, this [sic] [is] their number one concern right now, all these things
in this climate in this time, that type of comment is overkill. It's prejudicial, and we respectfully move for a mistrial.
The Court: All right. Sustain the motion for a mistrial. I think it's probably going a little too far. I think it's overwhelming
—the  motion  has  two  parts.  I  think  there's  a  lot  of  evidence  of—that—in  there  which  counsel  can  put  on  the
characterization she was in the drug business, as he has spelled out. But I don't think you can—should be asking
the jury to send anybody messages. It's the duty of the jury to convict if there's proof beyond a reasonable doubt and
to acquit if there isn't proof beyond a reasonable doubt, and the jury will be so admonished.

However, in the light of all the evidence I think it can be cured by an admonition. I don't think a little rhetoric if cured
by an admonition of the Court is going to taint the whole trial, during which counsel has been afforded—counsel for
the defense has been afforded great liberality. As you know, we were inclined not to give the entrapment instruction
at all. You got that.
[Defense Counsel]: I would have—
The Court: I think you've had a very fair trial and we will cure this with an admonition. He didn't get very far with it
before you interrupted him.

* * * * * *

The Court: It's the part about sending the message that I find objectionable.
[Defense Counsel]: The part about sending the message is amplified—
The Court: It's not their duty to send messages. It's their duty to acquit—or convict if there's evidence beyond a
reasonable doubt and acquit if there isn't evidence beyond a reasonable doubt. I'm going to tell them that when
they get back.
[Defense Counsel]: Well, without waiving our motion, we would ask for the instruction. I don't think it's going to cure it.
The Court: I think it will cure it.
[Defense Counsel]: It's going to be etched in granite on these jurors' minds.
The Court: Going to be what?
[Defense Counsel]: Etched in granite. It's going to be like trying to unring a bell. It's been told to them. He's gotten
his message across. He's gone to the community interests, the other drug problems and other drug dealers. I think
it's just a grievous error, Judge. The only way it can be rectified is to declare a mistrial.
The Court: Well, you made your motion. I'll overrule the motion. I'll correct it. I think it can be corrected with an
admonition. And to my observation of the jury you had a very fair trial, I think. We've been more liberal with you
than with most people as far as the time we've allowed you to take and everything. I think it can be cured with an
admonition. I'll do it when we get back. About ten more minutes.

Our holding in Henderson and the result reached in Alloway reflect a general rule followed by other circuits as well. In
United States v. Shirley, 435 F.2d 1076 (7th Cir.1970), the Seventh Circuit stated that the prosecutor's closing remarks
concerning the increasing number of cars being stolen did not overstep the bounds of fairness and propriety and could
not have worked a substantial injury to the defendant in denying him a fair trial because, even though the statements
were not particularly relevant and had no bearing on the guilt or innocence of the defendant, the remarks did not contain
an emotional appeal to the jurors' self-interest designed to arouse their prejudice against the defendant. Id. at 1079.

The Eighth Circuit has also stated, in a case where the prosecutor told the jurors that they were the public's last shield
and the district court instructed the jury to disregard the remark, that unless calculated to inflame, an appeal to the
jury to act as the conscience of the community is not impermissible. United States v. Lewis, 547 F.2d 1030, 1036
(8th Cir.), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 1111, 97 S.Ct. 1149, 51 L.Ed.2d 566 (1976). Similarly, the Eleventh Circuit, in United
States v. Kopituk, 690 F.2d 1289, 1342–43 (11th Cir.1982), cert. denied, 463 U.S. 1209, 103 S.Ct. 3542, 77 L.Ed.2d
1391 (1983), stated that appeals to the jury to act as the conscience of the community, unless designed to inflame the
jury, are not per se impermissible. However, the remarks complained of in Kopituk were found by the court to have
approached the line demarcating impermissible comment calculated to incite the jury against the accused, but not to
have crossed the line into the realm of impropriety and prejudice by directly suggesting that the jurors had personal
stakes in the outcome of the case.

Similar  reasoning  was  applied  in  Brown  v.  United  States,  370  F.2d  242  (D.C.Cir.1966),  a  case  involving  a  criminal
prosecution of an African–American youth for assault based on a confrontation between the defendant and two police
officers. The court found the prosecutor's community appeal improper. During closing argument, the prosecutor warned
the jury that to acquit the defendant would leave the police powerless to protect themselves and citizens against assault
short of resort to martial law. In condemning these remarks, and in reversing the defendant's conviction, the D.C. Circuit
found that such an argument was an appeal wholly irrelevant to any facts or issues in the case. Id. at 246 (relying on
Viereck, 318 U.S. at 247, 63 S.Ct. at 566, and Berger, 295 U.S. at 88, 55 S.Ct. at 633). Further, the court stated that the
prosecutor's argument raised the spectre of martial law and therefore constituted an especially flagrant and reprehensible
appeal to passion and prejudice in the context of current events (i.e., the social unrest of the late 1960s).

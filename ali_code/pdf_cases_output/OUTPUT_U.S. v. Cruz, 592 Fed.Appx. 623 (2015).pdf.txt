MEMORANDUM *

Jonathan  Cruz  (“Cruz”)  was  found  guilty  of  importing
9.84  kilograms  of  marijuana  and  4.50  kilograms  of
methamphetamine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 952 and 960,
and  sentenced  to  the  mandatory  minimum  sentence  of  ten
years. Cruz appeals his  *624  conviction and sentence. We
have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291. Because we reverse
Cruz's conviction for prosecutorial misconduct, we do not
reach his other issues.

We review prosecutorial misconduct claims for plain error
where  defense  counsel  failed  to  object  before  the  district
court.  United  States  v.  Reyes,  660  F.3d  454,  461  (9th
Cir.2011). Under plain error review, we will reverse Cruz's
conviction only if the prosecutor's statements were improper
and the statements resulted in substantial prejudice. United
States v. Sanchez, 659 F.3d 1252, 1256 (9th Cir.2011).

In rebuttal, the prosecutor argued “[Cruz] is guilty of what
he  is  charged  with.  Find  him  guilty  and  do  the  right  thing
and  make  him  finally  take  responsibility  for  what  he  did.”
By  stating  “do  the  right  thing”  the  prosecutor  improperly
expressed his personal opinion to the jury. See United States
v. McKoy, 771 F.2d 1207, 1210–11 (9th Cir.1985). Without
reference to the evidence or the burden of proof, the “do the
right thing” statement improperly urged the jury to convict
on the basis of the prosecutor's subjective belief of what was
“right,” as opposed to the persuasive force of the evidence.
See Sanchez, 659 F.3d at 1257 (holding prosecutor's statement
to  the  jury  to  “send  a  memo  to  all  drug  traffickers”  was
improper  because  it  urged  the  jury  to  convict  for  reasons
wholly  irrelevant  to  the  defendant's  guilt  or  innocence);
United  States  v.  Sanchez,  176  F.3d  1214,  1224–25  (9th
Cir.1999) (holding prosecutor's statement to the jury that it
was its duty to find defendant guilty was improper because
“the prosecutor did not tell the jury that it had a duty to find
the defendant guilty only if every element of the crime had
been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.”).

The  prosecutor's  “do  the  right  thing”  statement  was
prejudicial  to  Cruz  for  several  reasons.  First,  because  the
prosecutor is the sovereign's representative, the jury may have
been misled into thinking his “do the right thing” statement
was validated by the government. See United States v. Kerr,
981 F.2d 1050, 1053 (9th Cir.1992) (“A prosecutor has no
business  telling  the  jury  his  individual  impressions  of  the
evidence.  Because  he  is  the  sovereign's  representative,  the
jury may be misled into thinking his conclusions have been
validated  by  the  government's  investigatory  apparatus.”).
Second,  the  court  did  not  give  a  curative  instruction.
See  Sanchez,  659  F.3d  at  1258.  Third,  the  prosecutor's
rebuttal  argument  was  the  last  thing  the  jury  heard  before
beginning deliberation; this timing increased the risk that the
prosecutor's improper statement influenced the jurors. Id. at
1261. We reverse Cruz's convictions and remand for a new
trial.

U.S. v. Cruz, 592 Fed.Appx. 623 (2015)

REVERSED and REMANDED.

NGUYEN, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting
in part:
I  agree  that  the  prosecutor's  “do  the  right  thing”  statement
clearly  constitutes  prosecutorial  misconduct.  However,
under  plain  error  review,  we  may  only  reverse  when
“prosecutorial  misconduct  has  deprived  a  defendant  of  a
fair trial,” which we determine by “look[ing] to the substance
of  any  curative  instructions  and  the  strength  of  the  case
against the defendant absent the misconduct.” United States
v. Sanchez, 659 F.3d 1252, 1257 (9th Cir.2011).

Here, the evidence against Cruz was overwhelming—he was
caught  red-handed  with  the  drugs  in  his  car  and  confessed
that he agreed to smuggle the drugs for money. The single
instance of argument error during the government's rebuttal

did  not  affect  Cruz's  substantial  rights.  Nevertheless,  I  am
troubled by the government's failure to recognize the error,
*625  particularly because the same office that prosecuted
Cruz  recently  assured  us  that  its  training  would  “reinforce
the principle that all Assistant U.S. Attorneys must be aware
of the rules pertaining to closing argument and must make
every  effort  to  stay  well  within  those  rules.”  United  States
v. Maloney, 755 F.3d 1044, 1046 (9th Cir.2014) (en banc).
Although  the  trial  in  this  case  occurred  before  Maloney
was decided, the government, post-Maloney, insisted at oral
argument  that  its  statement  was  proper.  It  was  not.  As  the
majority stated, a prosecutor steps outside of his or her proper
role by encouraging the jury to “do the right thing.”

However, there's no basis for reversal, not on this or the three
other claims that Cruz also raised on appeal. I therefore would
affirm.

Prosecutor  committed  plain  error  in  misstating
the  testimony  of  identification  witness  by
insisting that she did not testify that federal agent
told her before she took the witness stand that she
had made a mistake in identifying robber, when
she  had  conceded  on  three  separate  occasions
during trial that agent had told her she made a
mistake, just before she gave her trial testimony,
and by repeatedly insisting that defense counsel

Conduct of Counsel in General

In determining when prosecutorial misconduct
warrants a new trial, a court must first consider
whether  the  prosecutor's  conduct  and  remarks
were  improper  and,  if  so,  the  court  must  then
consider  and  weigh  the  following  four  factors
in  determining  whether  the  impropriety  was
flagrant and thus warrants reversal: (1) whether
the conduct and remarks of the prosecutor tended
to  mislead  the  jury  or  prejudice  the  defendant;
(2)  whether  the  conduct  or  remarks  were
isolated  or  extensive;  (3)  whether  the  remarks
were deliberately or accidentally made; and (4)
whether the evidence against the defendant was
strong.

the prosecutor's comments within the context of
the  trial  to  determine  whether  such  comments
amounted to prejudicial error, and in so doing,
Court considers whether, and to what extent, the
prosecutor's  improper  remarks  were  invited  by
defense counsel's argument.

Although Carter now appeals his conviction on four grounds,
we focus primarily on his claim that the prosecution deprived
him of his right to due process and a fair trial under the Fifth
Amendment when the prosecutor committed prosecutorial
misconduct during closing arguments by misstating material
evidence and accusing defense counsel of lying. Because we
believe that the prosecutor committed misconduct that was
sufficient  to  constitute  plain  error  warranting  reversal,  we
REVERSE the judgment of the district court and REMAND

U.S. v. Carter, 236 F.3d 777 (2001)
2001 Fed.App. 0020P

I. BACKGROUND

On  October  15,  1996,  the  Community  First  Bank  of
Hartsville, Tennessee (hereinafter “Hartsville Bank” or “the
bank”), opened at 8:30 a.m., with four bank tellers, including
Terri  Lynn  Halliburton,  working  at  its  customer  windows.
Sheila Cornwell was the bank's first customer. While pulling
away from a carwash bay across the street before entering the
bank, Cornwell saw a black male standing next to “a big green
older model car.” Joint Appendix (“J.A.”) at 153. Cornwell
testified  that  this  man  was  wearing  coveralls  and  appeared
to be about “five seven, slender build .... [with] his hair ....
braided with sprigs, spriggly braided hair sticking up about
an inch maybe, half inch to an inch.” J.A. at 153-54.

While teller Halliburton was assisting the second customer
Kenneth Keller with his bank deposit, she noticed a black man
in  coveralls  enter  the  bank  and  approach  the  desk.  Shortly
after Keller had arrived, Dwight Holder entered the bank and
noticed the man in coveralls, who by then was approaching
Halliburton's window. Holder described the man as a black
man  who  was  wearing  “brown  coveralls  ...  or  tan-looking
color coveralls .... a baseball cap” and “pretty new looking
boots” and who was “between 5-10 and six foot tall.” J.A. at
322-23, 326, 343.

When  the  man  in  coveralls  finally  reached  Halliburton's
window, he handed her a note that “said a 100 and a 50 and
a 20”; the other side of the note said “ ‘You will be dead!’ ”
J.A. at 416. Halliburton realized that she was the victim of a
robbery and looked to Holder as if to say “ ‘Help me, Dwight.”
J.A.  at  417.  Holder  testified  that  he  saw  the  hesitancy  in
Halliburton's face and looked at the man, at which point the
man showed him what appeared to be the butt of a gun.

In response to the note from the man in coveralls, Halliburton
gave  the  man  a  hundred-dollar  bill,  a  fifty-dollar  bill,  and
a twenty-dollar bill, to which the man responded “ ‘Give it
all  to  me.  I  have  a  gun.’  ”  J.A.  at  417.  While  reaching  for
more money, Halliburton pulled the bait money, setting off
the silent alarm, but accidentally making “a gong noise to the
middle drawer.” J.A. at 418. The robber then took the $170
on the counter and walked out the front door.

After  the  robber  exited,  Holder  stated  aloud,  “You  have
been robbed.... Call the police.” J.A. at 330-31. Holder then
proceeded  out  the  front  door  and  saw  “an  older  type  car,
[with]  kind  of  a  darkish  green  color”  and  “an  Indiana  tag”
pull  away.  J.A.  at  331-32.  As  Holder  watched  the  car  pull
away, he screamed for someone to write the car's license plate
numbers as he called them out; the numbers he called were
“either 988831 or 988861.” J.A. at 331, 342-43.

Meanwhile, Keller was driving on Highway 25 to return to
his  restaurant.  While  on  the  road,  Keller  observed  a  black
male  *780  recklessly driving a big green car with an Indiana
tag. When Keller arrived at his restaurant, he called 911 and
reported the car to the police.

By  then,  the  police  had  arrived  at  the  bank,  spoken  to
witnesses, and put out a broadcast of the vehicle description
over  the  radio,  a  “Be  on  the  Lookout”  (“BOLO”).  After
hearing  the  BOLO,  Officer  Jerry  Hickman  of  the  Gallatin
Police  Department  contacted  Chief  Hank  Scruggs  of  the
Hartsville  Police  Department  and  told  the  Chief  that  he
thought he had run a check on the tag number of a car that fit
the BOLO description just the night before. Officer Hickman
had a practice of running checks on cars with out-of-state tags
in  the  Lackey  Circle  area,  which  is  a  government  housing
project, to see if they were stolen. Officer Hickman testified
that, in the early morning hours of October 15, 1996, he ran
a check on an out-of state car that he saw with Indiana tag
99S6881 in the Lackey Circle area. This check revealed that
the car was not stolen but showed no other information, as
Officer Hickman was unable to process out-of-state tags fully.

After  speaking  with  the  Chief,  Officer  Hickman  asked
Detective  Stanley  Hilgadick  of 
the  Gallatin  Police
Department to try to locate the car in the Lackey Circle area.
Detective  Hilgadick  did  not  locate  the  car  in  the  area  but
heard from several people in the neighborhood that “Roquel
Halcomb”  drove  the  car.  Because  Detective  Hilgadick  had
known Barbara Halcomb, Carter's aunt, for several years, he
went to her home to ask her if she knew “Roquel Halcomb.”
Ms.  Halcomb  informed  the  Detective  that  Carter  was  the
person  who  owned  the  car  in  question.  The  prosecution
also  contends  that,  during  her  interview  on  October  17,
1996,  Ms.  Halcomb  viewed  a  videotape  taken  at  a  Citgo
station  in  Hartsville,  Tennessee,  on  October  15,  1996,  and
identified  Carter  as  an  individual  walking  past  the  cashier
in  the  videotape.  J.A.  at  186-87,  193-94.  Ms.  Halcomb,

U.S. v. Carter, 236 F.3d 777 (2001)

however,  testified  that  she  did  not  identify  Carter  in  the
videotape.  J.A.  at  183-84.  On  cross-examination,  defense
counsel elicited further information from Officer Russ Pulley
about Ms. Halcomb's alleged identification of Carter in the
videotape. Officer Pulley's testimony revealed that, contrary
to a frequently used police procedure, Ms. Halcomb did not
sign or affirm any written statement to indicate that such an
identification had been made.

With the information Detective Hilgadick received from Ms.
Halcomb,  the  Gallatin  Police  Department  issued  a  BOLO,
which listed information about Carter, including his height,
weight,  and  address  in  Gallatin,  as  well  as  the  names  of
his  family  members  in  Indianapolis,  Indiana.  The  BOLO
also stated that Carter was a suspect in two robberies and a
shooting and had failed to appear for a warrant against him
in Indianapolis.

Further  into  their  investigation,  the  police  received  more
information from Kathleen Ford, an employee at the Citgo gas
station in Hartsville, who claimed to have seen a suspicious
looking  black  man  at  the  Citgo  station  on  the  morning  of
the  robbery.  Specifically,  Ford  told  the  Chief  that,  early  in
the  morning  on  October  15,  1996,  she  had  seen  a  black
man  between  five  feet,  three  inches  and  six  feet  tall  and
with curly hair, come into the market; go to the men's room
where he stayed for fifteen to twenty minutes; leave the store
without  purchasing  anything;  get  into  an  old  model,  green
car; and begin to dress in gold coveralls. Recordings from a
surveillance camera in the Citgo market corroborated Ford's
testimony, showing a black man, who was wearing a dark-
colored  jacket  with  letters  on  its  front,  enter  and  leave  the
Citgo market as described.

A check with the Indiana authorities revealed that the green
car  with  license  number  99S6881  was  registered  to  Rose
Colwell from Indianapolis, who testified at trial to selling her
car to “Rock Carter” on August 29, 1996. J.A. at 97. She also
testified that she let “Rock Carter” borrow her tags while he
repaired the car, and  *781  that he promised to bring the tags
back but never did.

On October 17, 1996, Sergeant James Lanier was patrolling
near White House, Tennessee, and saw a black male driving a
green car that matched the description of a BOLO he received
in connection with a robbery. Sergeant Lanier testified that he
ran the tag number of a car, which was Indiana tag 99S6881;

followed  the  car;  and  later  approached  the  driver  at  a  gas
station. The man, however, fled from Lanier and successfully
escaped in his green car. At trial, Sergeant Lanier identified
Carter  as  the  man  he  had  chased  in  White  House.  On  the
night of the chase, however, Sergeant Lanier identified Terry
Johnson,  not  Carter,  as  the  man  who  had  fled  from  him.
Sergeant  Lanier  had  identified  Johnson  from  a  photograph
that  was  provided  to  him  by  the  authorities  in  Simpson
County, Kentucky after he had called in to report his chase
in  White  House.  J.A.  at  634,  643.  Additionally,  Sergeant
Lanier's written report of the chase failed to mention that he
had observed an Indiana license plate or a license number and
did  not  identify  99S68881  as  an  observed  license  number.
J.A. at 637-38.

On October 18, 1996, after receiving a “suspicious person”
call  from  the  Best  Western  Hotel  in  Riverside,  Alabama,
Officer Rick Oliver went to the hotel where he found a young
black  man  asleep  in  a  green  car.  After  some  conversation
with  the  young  man,  Officer  Oliver  began  a  pat-down  for
weapons. In the middle of the pat-down, however, the man
fled  with  his  gun-initially  on  foot  and  then  eventually  in  a
stolen pick-up truck. At trial, Officer Oliver identified Carter
as the man he had stopped in Riverside. He also testified that
the jacket Carter was wearing at the time of his arrest was the
same jacket that Officer Oliver saw on the man he pursued
in Riverside. Carter was later arrested in Lincoln, Alabama,
where he was forced outside a barn by police with tear gas.

After Carter's arrest, Officer Oliver inventoried the green car
that  was  abandoned  in  the  hotel  parking  lot  in  Riverside.
In  so  doing,  he  found  a  number  of  items,  including  (1)  an
Indiana license plate reading 99S6881; (2) receipts in Carter's
name  from  a  Firestone  tire  service  center  in  Indianapolis,
Indiana; (3) receipts dated October 8, 1996, from Wal-mart
and R.H. Music Store in Gallatin, Tennessee, which appear
to  corroborate  the  testimony  from  Anita  Duncan,  Carter's
first cousin, who testified that Carter was driving the green
Chrysler at that time in 1996; and (4) a receipt dated October
18, 1996, from Mapco Express in Cornersville, Tennessee,
which  is  south  of  Gallatin  and  north  of  Lincoln,  Alabama,
where Carter was eventually arrested.

Carter's  trial  commenced  in  federal  district  court  on
December 8, 1998. One of the Government's key witnesses at
trial was Halliburton, the teller who had been robbed at her
bank window on October 15, 1996. In her direct examination,

U.S. v. Carter, 236 F.3d 777 (2001)
2001 Fed.App. 0020P
Halliburton identified Carter as the man who robbed the bank.
During cross-examination, however, Halliburton stated that
just  two  days  after  the  robbery,  she  saw  a  Channel  4  TV
news  clip  on  a  robbery  suspect  that  showed  a  picture  of
Terry Johnson 1  but identified the pictured suspect as Roquel
Carter. She then called Chief Scruggs to tell him that she just
saw a picture of the man who robbed the bank. Prior to seeing
the TV news clip, Halliburton had not looked at and was not
asked to view a photograph spread of potential suspects. In
fact, Halliburton was not asked to look at a photograph spread
of suspects until September of 1998, nearly two years  *782
after the robbery and just a few months before trial. When she
was finally asked to view a photograph spread, Halliburton
declined to look at any pictures because she “knew the trial
was  coming  up  and  [she]  just  didn't  feel  comfortable  ...
looking at a whole bunch of pictures” and because she “didn't
want to look at anything else that might confuse [her].” J.A.
at  75,  427.  Additionally,  at  trial  Halliburton  explained  that
when she arrived to testify at Carter's trial, she still believed
she was going to identify the person she saw in the TV news
clip as the robber. She further testified that she changed her
testimony only after Agent Whitten, who was sitting at the
prosecution's table during trial, told her “it was the right name,
Roquel Carter, but the wrong face” on the TV news clip. 2
J.A. at 88.

After  defense  counsel  finished  his  closing  argument,  in
which  he  pointed  out  the  changes  Halliburton  made  in
her  identification  testimony,  the  prosecutor  began  his
rebuttal argument. The beginning of the prosecutor's rebuttal
argument was as follows:

MR.  KENNEDY:  Ladies  and  gentlemen,  I  am  going  to
submit  to  you  to-will  try  to  yell  and  scream  I  submit  to
you,  you  have  heard  one  tremendous  colossal  lie.  Terri
Lynn Halliburton Presley testified she did-remember what
she said [?] She did not say, “You have got the right guy
but the wrong face.” And she never said anybody for the
Government told her that. Remember what her answer was,
she said, “I was told to give an honest answer.” The only
person who has ever said she said that is Doug Thoresen
[defense counsel]. She never said that. That is a lie, a bold
fabrication. She said, “I was told that the man in the picture
is not Roquel Carter.” She didn't say, “I was told you have
got the wrong guy”. On that question, she answered, “I was
told to be honest.”

* * * * * *

And it is an absolutely whole lie that she was told that she
had the wrong guy on the bank robbery. She was told to
give her honest answer, period. Don't let them sneak that
one over on you. Evaluate the case, evaluate what it is, do
your job. But don't let that curve sneak across the plate. It's
a lie.

J.A.  at  560-61  (emphasis  added).  Defense  counsel  never
objected during the prosecutor's rebuttal argument.

Once closing arguments concluded, the district court gave its
general charge to the jury, and the jury began deliberations.
On  the  morning  of  December  16,  1998,  the  second  day  of
deliberations, the jury sent the district court a message, asking
whether it could base its verdict upon circumstantial evidence
without basing it upon eyewitness identification. J.A. at 593.
The district court then responded by providing the following
instruction:  “you  can  base  a  verdict  upon  circumstantial
evidence but only if that circumstantial evidence convinces
you beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant is guilty of
the crime charged in the Indictment.” J.A. at 594-95. About an
hour later, the jury came back with a guilty verdict. Defense
counsel immediately asked the district court to poll the jury to
ask if its members discounted eyewitness testimony and based
their  verdict  on  circumstantial  evidence.  The  district  court
did not poll the jury, instead asking the foreperson if some
jurors based their verdict only on circumstantial evidence and
if some were satisfied with the eyewitness identifications. The
foreperson  responded  in  the  affirmative,  and  all  the  jurors
agreed.

II. ANALYSIS

[1]
  Although  Carter  raises  four  grounds  for  appeal  in  his
brief, we focus on  *783  only his prosecutorial misconduct
claim  regarding  the  prosecutor's  comments  during  closing
arguments, as we find such conduct to be reversible error. 3
Carter  argues  that  his  conviction  should  be  reversed  and
that  this  case  should  be  remanded  for  a  new  trial  because
the prosecutor committed flagrant misconduct during closing
arguments. Specifically, Carter contends that the prosecutor
misstated the testimony of Halliburton when the prosecutor
insisted  that  Halliburton  did  not  testify  that  Agent  Whitten

told her “it was the right name ... but the wrong face” before
she took the witness stand. J.A. at 88. Carter further argues
that  the  prosecutor  misled  the  jury  by  repeatedly  insisting
that defense counsel was lying about Halliburton's testimony.
For  the  reasons  stated  below,  we  agree  that  such  conduct
constituted  plain  error  sufficient  to  warrant  a  reversal  of
Carter's conviction and to remand for a new trial.

[2]
 The Sixth Circuit has adopted a two-step approach for
determining when prosecutorial misconduct warrants a new
trial. See United States v. Carroll, 26 F.3d 1380, 1385-87 (6th
Cir.1994). Under this approach, a court must first consider
whether the prosecutor's conduct and remarks were improper.
Id.  at  1387;  see  also  Boyle  v.  Million,  201  F.3d  711,  717
(6th  Cir.2000).  If  the  remarks  were  improper,  the  court
must  then  consider  and  weigh  four  factors  in  determining
whether  the  impropriety  was  flagrant  and  thus  warrants
reversal. These four factors are as follows: (1) whether the
conduct and remarks of the prosecutor tended to mislead the
jury or prejudice the defendant; (2) whether the conduct or
remarks were isolated or extensive; (3) whether the remarks
were deliberately or accidentally made; and (4) whether the
evidence against the defendant was strong. Carroll, 26 F.3d
at  1385;  see  also  Boyle,  201  F.3d  at  717;  United  States  v.
Collins, 78 F.3d 1021, 1039 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 519 U.S.
872, 117 S.Ct. 189, 136 L.Ed.2d 127 (1996).

[3]
  When  reviewing  challenges  to  a  prosecutor's  remarks
at  trial,  we  examine  the  prosecutor's  comments  within  the
context  of  the  trial  to  determine  whether  such  comments
amounted  to  prejudicial  error.  United  States  v.  Young,  470
U.S. 1, 11-12, 105 S.Ct. 1038, 84 L.Ed.2d 1 (1985); Collins,
78  F.3d  at  1040.  In  so  doing,  we  consider  whether,  and  to
what extent, the prosecutor's improper remarks were invited
by defense counsel's argument. Young, 470 U.S. at 12, 105
S.Ct. 1038; Collins, 78 F.3d at 1040.

  [5]

  In  this  case,  because  defense  counsel  made  no

[4]
objection to the prosecutor's statements at trial, this court will
review for plain error only. Collins, 78 F.3d at 1039. As this
court has previously recognized, “prosecutorial misconduct
may be so exceptionally flagrant that it constitutes plain error,
and  is  grounds  for  reversal  even  if  the  defendant  did  not
object to it.” Carroll, 26 F.3d at 1385 n. 6. In United States
v.  Olano,  507  U.S.  725,  113  S.Ct.  1770,  123  L.Ed.2d  508
(1993), the Supreme Court set forth three factors a defendant
must prove to obtain relief under a plain error analysis. First,

the defendant must show that there was an error. Id. at 732-33,
113 S.Ct. 1770. Error is defined as “[d]eviation from a legal
rule ... unless the rule has been waived,” and waiver is defined
as  the  “  ‘intentional  relinquishment  or  abandonment  of  a
known right.’ ” Id. at 733, 113 S.Ct. 1770 (quoting Johnson
v. Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458, 464, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 82 L.Ed. 1461
(1938)). Second, the defendant must show that the error was
plain  or  obvious  under  current  *784   law.  Id.  at  734,  113
S.Ct. 1770. Finally, the defendant must establish that the plain
error affected his substantial rights. This means that “the error
must have been prejudicial: It must have affected the outcome
of the district court proceedings.” Id. If these requirements
are  satisfied,  then  the  court  of  appeals  should  exercise
its  discretion  to  remedy  the  error  “if  the  error  ‘seriously
affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial
proceedings.’ ” Id. at 736, 113 S.Ct. 1770 (quotation omitted).
The Supreme Court and this court have subsequently clarified
that the Olano test involves four steps. See Johnson v. United
States, 520 U.S. 461, 466-67, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d
718 (1997) (“[B]efore an appellate court can correct an error
not raised at trial, there must be (1) error, (2) that is plain,
and (3) that affect[s] substantial rights. If all three conditions
are met, an appellate court may then exercise its discretion
to notice a forfeited error, but only if (4) the error seriously
affect[s] the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial
proceedings.”) (quotations omitted); United States v. Monus,
128 F.3d 376, 386 (6th Cir.1998). Carroll provides, as noted
above, four specific factors to consider in evaluating whether
a prosecutor's improper conduct or remarks warrant reversal.

A. Error/Plain Error
[6]
 We conclude that the prosecutor's conduct during closing
arguments  not  only  constituted  error  but  also  was  plain
error. The law is clear that, while counsel has the freedom
at  trial  to  argue  reasonable  inferences  from  the  evidence,
counsel cannot misstate evidence or make personal attacks on
opposing counsel. See Young, 470 U.S. at 9 & n. 7, 105 S.Ct.
1038; Collins, 78 F.3d at 1040. In this case, the prosecutor
committed both of these prohibited acts.

First, although the prosecutor correctly stated that Halliburton
testified she was told to be honest, he incorrectly stated that
Halliburton  did  not  admit  to  being  told  she  had  made  a
mistake  in  identifying  the  robber  at  the  bank.  In  actuality,
Halliburton had conceded on three separate occasions during
trial  that  Agent  Whitten  had  told  her,  just  before  she  gave

her  trial  testimony,  that  she  had  made  a  “mistake”  in  her
identification of the robber. For example, the trial transcript
reads:

Q:  You  were  the  witness  to  the  bank  robbery,  is  that

correct?

A: That's correct.

Q: And he [Agent Whitten] told you that you had made a

mistake, is that right?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: And you accepted that?

A: Yes, sir.

* * * * * *

Q: You changed your mind about identifying the person
[who] robbed the Hartsville bank that you had previously
identified  after  Agent  Whitten  on  the  morning  ...  this
trial was supposed to start told you that you had made a
mistake in identifying the person?

A: That's correct.

Q: And when you knew or came into this room after not
having  seen  the  photo  spread,  you  knew  that  Roquel
Carter would be in this room?

A: Yes, sir.

J.A. at 79-80 (emphasis added).

The transcript further reads:

Q:  When  you  came  here  from  Hartsville  on  Tuesday,
December 8th to testify, you still thought you were going
to identify the person who is in these videos [including
the TV news clip showing Terry Johnson's picture], isn't
that true, as the man [who] robbed you?

A: Yes, sir.

Q: What made you change your mind?

* * * * * *

A. It was Tuesday morning. They told me there had been a
change and they had told me that the person [whom] I
had identified on Channel 4 News was not-his name was
not Roquel Carter.

*785  Q: Who told you that?

A: [Agent] Whitten.

J.A. at 77, 79 (emphasis added).

The transcript also reads:

Q: .... You testified a moment ago about a mistake. What

type of mistake were you told had occurred?

A: I was told that it was the right name, Roquel Carter, but
the wrong face. That was the mistake that I was told they
had made on the news.

J.A. at 88 (emphasis added).

In  sum,  the  prosecutor  clearly  misrepresented  material
evidence when he asserted that Halliburton had not been told
“it  was  the  right  name  ...  but  the  wrong  face”  before  she
took the witness stand and that “[t]he only person who has
ever said that is Doug Thoresen [defense counsel].” J.A. at
560. Given that this court has recognized that it is improper
for attorneys, especially prosecutors who generally have the
confidence of juries, to misstate evidence, we conclude that
the  prosecutor's  misstatement  of  the  evidence  in  this  case,
specifically of Halliburton's testimony, was not only error but
also was plain error. See Washington v. Hofbauer, 228 F.3d
689, 700 (6th Cir.2000) (citing  Donnelly  v.  DeChristoforo,
416 U.S. 637, 646, 94 S.Ct. 1868, 40 L.Ed.2d 431 (1974)); see
also Davis v. Zant, 36 F.3d 1538, 1548 n. 15 (11th Cir.1994)
(“It  is  a  fundamental  tenet  of  the  law  that  attorneys  may
not  make  material  misstatements  of  fact  in  summation.”).
Cf. A.B.A., ABA Standards for Criminal Justice Prosecution
Function and Defense Function 3-5.8(a) (3d ed. 1993) (“The
prosecutor should not intentionally misstate the evidence or
mislead the jury as to the inferences it may draw.”).

Additionally,  because  this  court,  along  with  the  Supreme
Court,  has  repeatedly  noted  that  it  is  improper  for  counsel
to make personal attacks on an opposing advocate, we also
conclude  that  the  prosecutor's  claims  that  defense  counsel
was  lying  were  not  only  error  but  also  were  plain  error.

U.S. v. Carter, 236 F.3d 777 (2001)
2001 Fed.App. 0020P
Young,  470  U.S.  at  9,  105  S.Ct.  1038;  Collins,  78  F.3d  at
1040. As the trial transcript reveals, the prosecutor personally
attacked  defense  counsel's  truthfulness  four  times  during
his rebuttal argument by asserting that defense counsel was
lying about Halliburton's testimony and trying to “sneak ...
one  over  on  [the  jury].”  J.A.  at  561.  Specifically,  the
prosecutor asserted that defense counsel's characterization of
Halliburton's testimony was “one tremendous colossal lie,”
“a  lie,  a  bold  fabrication,”  “an  absolutely  whole  lie,”  and
just plain “a lie.” J.A. at 560-61. In sum, because Carter has
successfully shown that the prosecutor committed clear error
under current law by misrepresenting material evidence and
accusing defense counsel of lying, we conclude that Carter
has satisfied both the first and second requirements for relief
under a plain error analysis.

B. Whether The Misconduct Substantially Affected
Carter's Rights and Warrants Reversal
[7]
  We  also  conclude,  based  upon  our  analysis  of  the
prosecutor's misconduct under the four factors of the Carroll
test, that the prosecutor's actions affected Carter's substantial
rights and warrant reversal.

1. Whether The Prosecutor's Comments Were Likely To
Prejudice Carter
The  first  required  factor  of  the  Carroll  test  is  that  the
prosecutor's comments were likely to mislead and prejudice
the  jury.  We  believe  that  Carter  has  shown  that  the
prosecutor's  misstatement  of  Halliburton's  testimony  and
personal attacks on defense counsel's truthfulness were likely
to mislead the jury and cause prejudice to Carter.

regarding  Halliburton's 

At  the  outset,  we  note  our  belief  that  the  prosecutor's
misstatement 
testimony  was
inherently prejudicial to Carter. This court has consistently
recognized that a prosecutor's misrepresentation of material
evidence can have a significant impact on jury deliberations
“because a jury generally has confidence that a prosecuting
attorney  is  faithfully  *786   observing  his  obligation  as  a
representative  of  a  sovereignty.”  Washington,  228  F.3d  at
700; see also United States v. Solivan, 937 F.2d 1146, 1150
(6th  Cir.1991)  (Because  jurors  are  likely  to  “place  great
confidence  in  the  faithful  execution  of  the  obligations  of  a
prosecuting  attorney,  improper  insinuations  or  suggestions
[by the prosecutor] are apt to carry [great] weight against a

defendant” and therefore are more likely to mislead a jury.);
United States v. Smith, 500 F.2d 293, 295 (6th Cir.1974). 4
More importantly, the prosecutor's misrepresentation in this
case  held  an  even  greater  potential  for  misleading  the  jury
because the misstated evidence, Halliburton's testimony, was
central  to  the  Government's  case.  Because  Halliburton  was
the only person who was at the bank during the robbery to
identify Carter as the robber, her identification testimony was
of critical importance to the prosecution.

Defense counsel recognized the significance of Halliburton's
testimony and raised several significant and relevant issues
for  the  jury  to  consider  during  his  cross-examination  of
Halliburton.  Specifically,  he  raised  important  questions
regarding the propriety of Agent Whitten's telling Halliburton
that  “it  was  the  right  name,  Roquel  Carter,  but  the  wrong
face” just prior to Halliburton's taking the witness stand. As
defense counsel's cross-examination of Halliburton revealed,
Halliburton did not even know the name of the man shown on
the Channel 4 TV news clip until a few days before trial and
did not recall telling the police the name of the man on the clip
when she identified him as the robber nearly two years before.
Therefore,  defense  counsel  highlighted  serious  questions
regarding  whether  the  name  of  the  man  in  the  clip  even
mattered  to  Halliburton  before  she  testified.  Additionally,
defense counsel's cross-examination of Halliburton revealed
that  Halliburton  had  no  intention  to  change  her  previous
identification of Johnson until after Agent Whitten told her
she had made a mistake, that Halliburton knew Carter was
sitting at the defense table before she took the witness stand,
and that Carter was the only black person in the courtroom at
the time Halliburton testified. In other words, defense counsel
pointed  out  critical  problems  concerning  the  reliability  of
Halliburton's  in-court  identification  and  important  issues
concerning possible attempts by the prosecution to influence
Halliburton's testimony before she took the witness stand. 5

The  prosecutor,  however,  tainted  the  jury's  ability  to
weigh  Halliburton's  averments  of  honesty  during  her  in-
court  identification  of  Carter  against  these  suspicious
circumstances  when  he  repeatedly  asserted  that  defense
counsel was lying and mistakenly claimed that Halliburton
did  not  admit  to  being  told  she  had  made  a  mistake  in
her initial identification. With these actions, the prosecutor
may  very  well  have  caused  the  jurors,  some  of  whom
relied  on  Halliburton's  in-court  identification  of  Carter  in

making their decision to  *787  convict, to question whether
they remembered Halliburton's testimony correctly. He also
may  have  further  caused  these  jurors  to  question  other
arguments presented by defense counsel who was portrayed
by the prosecutor as lying. In sum, the prosecutor adversely
influenced the jury's ability to assess Halliburton's credibility
and  to  evaluate  her  in-court  identification  of  Carter  as  the
robber,  in  contrast  to  her  previous  identification  of  Terry
Johnson as the robber.

 Such prejudice, however, could have been cured,

  [9]

[8]
or  at  least  minimized,  by  curative  instructions  to  the
jury.  Consequently,  we  must  now  determine  whether  any
prejudice caused by the prosecutor's misconduct was cured by
instructions given to the jury. Carroll, 26 F.3d at 1385 (“The
first factor [whether the remarks tended to mislead the jury or
to prejudice the defendant] includes consideration of whether
the trial judge gave an appropriate cautionary instruction to
the jury.”). Ordinarily, a court should not overturn a criminal
conviction  on  the  basis  of  a  prosecutor's  comments  alone,
especially  where  the  district  court  has  given  the  jury  an
instruction that may cure the error. See Young, 470 U.S. at
11-13,  105  S.Ct.  1038;  United  States  v.  Cobleigh,  75  F.3d
242,  247  (6th  Cir.1996).  As  a  general  matter,  juries  are
presumed to understand and follow directions from the court.
United States v. Forrest, 17 F.3d 916, 920-21 (6th Cir.), cert.
denied,  511  U.S.  1113,  114  S.Ct.  2115,  128  L.Ed.2d  673
(1994).

[10]
 In this case, although we believe that the district court
could  have  given  an  instruction  that  neutralized  the  error,
we  do  not  believe  that  any  of  the  jury  instructions  given
at  this  trial  sufficiently  cured  the  prejudice  caused  by  the
prosecutor's  actions.  We  note  that  defense  counsel  did  not
request any curative instruction. The only possibly relevant
instruction  given  by  the  district  court  was  an  instruction
that  “objections  or  arguments  made  by  the  lawyers  are
not  evidence  in  the  case.”  J.A.  at  574.  This  instruction,
however, was made along with all other routine instructions
for evaluating the evidence presented at trial. Furthermore,
the  instruction  was  not  given  at  the  time  of  the  improper
comments. Instead, it was given only after closing arguments
had  been  completed  and,  even  then,  after  a  fifteen-minute
recess. Therefore, there was nothing directly linking this jury
instruction to the prosecutor's misconduct. See Lent v. Wells,
861  F.2d  972,  977  (6th  Cir.1988),  cert.  denied,  489  U.S.
1100, 109 S.Ct. 1577, 103 L.Ed.2d 943 (1989) (trial judge's

instructions did not cure the error caused by the misconduct
because  “[n]o  curative  instructions  were  given  at  the  time
of defense's objections” and the “judge did not mention the
prosecutor's improper comments” during his general charge
to  the  jury);  see  also  Smith,  500  F.2d  at  298  (cautionary
instruction did not neutralize the prejudice of comments that
called attention to the defendants' failure to testify because
it  “failed  expressly  to  instruct  the  jury  that  no  adverse
inference  could  be  drawn  from  [the  defendants']  silence”).
Cf. United States v. Cruz-Padilla, 227 F.3d 1064, 1069 (8th
Cir.2000)  (prejudice  caused  by  prosecutorial  misconduct
during closing argument was not cured because the district
court issued no curative instructions where the defense failed
to object to the misconduct). We believe that measures more
substantial  than  a  general  instruction  that  “objections  or
arguments made by the lawyers are not evidence in the case”
were needed to cure the prejudicial effect of the prosecutor's
comments during closing arguments. 6  As the Ninth Circuit
stated  in  United  States  v.  Kerr,  “it  is  very  doubtful  that
the generalized observations of the court really conveyed a
sufficient sense of judicial approval of both  *788  content
and  circumstances  needed  to  dispell  [sic]  the  harm  in  the
core  of  the  prosecutor's  statements.”  981  F.2d  1050,  1053
(9th  Cir.1992)  (quotation  omitted).  In  conclusion,  in  light
of  the  suspect  circumstances  surrounding  Halliburton's  in-
court identification and the fact that no curative instructions
were given shortly after the prosecutor's improper comments
during closing arguments, we conclude that the prosecutor's
misconduct significantly impacted the jury's ability to assess
Halliburton's testimony.

2. Whether The Prosecutor's Comments Were Isolated
Or Extensive
The  second  required  factor  under  the  Carroll  test  is
that  the  improper  comments  must  be  more  than  mere
isolated remarks, incapable of infecting the entire trial. If a
prosecutor's  comments  were  simply  isolated  remarks  made
during the course of a long trial, then the error caused by such
misconduct may be harmless. United States v. Leon, 534 F.2d
667, 679 (6th Cir.1976).

After considering the prosecutor's improper comments within
the context of the entire trial, we conclude that such comments
were  not  merely  harmless,  isolated  comments  but  instead
were prejudicial statements that infected the entire trial. The
prosecutor's improper comments occurred during his rebuttal

U.S. v. Carter, 236 F.3d 777 (2001)

argument and therefore were the last words from an attorney
that were heard by the jury before deliberations. Given the
critical nature of Halliburton's testimony, the weaknesses in
some  of  the  circumstantial  evidence  presented  at  trial,  see
infra, and the lasting impression that certainly remained with
the jury after the prosecutor's rebuttal argument, we cannot
state that the prosecutor's conduct did not shake our faith in
the jury's verdict. Moreover, we do not believe that the fact
the prosecutor made these improper comments only during
closing  arguments  alters  the  extent  of  the  prejudice  caused
by  them. 7   As  we  have  previously  acknowledged,  “even  a
‘single misstep on the part  *789  of the prosecutor may be
so  destructive  of  the  right  of  the  defendant  to  a  fair  trial
that reversal must follow.’ ” Smith, 500 F.2d at 297 (quoting
Pierce v. United States, 86 F.2d 949, 952 (6th Cir.1936)).

[11]
  We  also  do  not  believe  that  the  prosecutor's
comments  were  an  invited  response  to  defense  counsel's
statements  during  closing  argument. 8   Instead,  we  see
defense  counsel's  arguments  as  a  restatement  *790   of
Halliburton's explanation of how she came to identify Carter,
instead  of  Johnson,  as  the  robber,  and  the  reasons  why
defense  counsel  believed  such  changes  and  explanations
lacked  credibility,  i.e.  Halliburton's  changes  reflected  her
desire  to  please  the  prosecution.  In  other  words,  we  view
defense  counsel's  closing  argument  as  simply  a  legitimate
attempt to cast doubt on the credibility of a witness who, for
two years, had held the belief that Terry Johnson, the man
she  had  confidently  identified  as  the  robber  only  two  days
after the robbery, 9  was the man who robbed Hartsville Bank
on  October  15,  1996,  and  who  changed  her  identification
testimony only after a federal agent informed her that “it was
the right name ... but the wrong face” on the TV news clip.
J.A. at 88.

Finally,  we  do  not  believe  that  the  prejudicial  effects  of
the prosecutor's improper comments were any less extensive
because the prosecutor later told the jury that it could question
the credibility of Halliburton. The prosecutor stated:

“I don't know what more I can say to
that. You may question [Halliburton]
for  sure....  [Seeing]  her  live  and  in
person look at ... Carter, look at these
pictures, and tell you what her honest
answer  is  to  the  best  of  her  ability,

as  you  watched  her  go  through  the
thought process for the very first time,
and  answer  the  questions.  That  is  to
your benefit as judges of the facts of
this case.”

J.A. at 561.

[12]
 As we previously noted in this opinion, juries are apt to
place great confidence in the statements of prosecutors, and
we do not believe that this brief statement by the prosecutor
was  sufficient  to  overcome  the  prejudice  caused  by  his
repeated insistence that defense counsel was lying and that
Halliburton had not admitted to being told she had made a
mistake.

3. Whether The Comments Were Deliberately Or
Accidentally Placed Before The Jury
The  third  required  factor  under  the  Carroll  test  is  that
the  improper  comments  be  deliberately  placed  before  the
jury. After careful review, we conclude that the prosecutor
knowingly  and  deliberately  made  his  improper  comments
before the jury. In Young, the Supreme Court explained that
the proper course of action for an attorney who takes issue
with comments made by opposing counsel is for that attorney
to  object  to  the  offensive  comments,  not  to  respond  with
equally offensive comments. Young, 470 U.S. at 13, 105 S.Ct.
1038  (noting  that  “the  prosecutor  at  the  close  of  defense
summation  should  have  objected  to  the  defense  counsel's
improper statements with a request that the court give a  *791
timely warning and curative instruction to the jury”).

In  this  case,  the  prosecutor  did  not  object  to  what  he
believed was a mischaracterization of Halliburton's testimony
by  defense  counsel,  nor  did  he  attempt  to  refute  defense
counsel's  closing  argument  by  pointing  to  contradictory
evidence presented at trial. Instead, the prosecutor repeatedly
claimed that defense counsel, a man whom, as the prosecutor
noted  during  appellate  oral  argument,  he  had  known  for
many  years  and  whom  he  held  in  high  regard,  was  telling
a “colossal lie.” In other words, rather than properly object
to  what  he  believed  were  improper  statements  made  by
defense  counsel,  the  prosecutor  simply  committed  another
clear wrong and thereby eliminated any possibility that the
district court could correct defense counsel's wrongs with a
curative instruction. When such action is viewed in light of

the prosecutor's familiarity with defense counsel, it must be
considered deliberate and calculated.

Indeed, the very repetition with which the prosecutor stated
that  defense  counsel  had  lied,  in  and  of  itself,  reveals  that
such  comments  were  not  accidentally  placed  before  the
jury.  See  United  States  v.  Smith,  962  F.2d  923,  935  (9th
Cir.1992)  (“The  repeated  comments  also  demonstrate  that
the errors were not inadvertent; clearly, we are not dealing
with a spontaneous comment that could be regretted but not
retracted.”). Consequently, we conclude that Carter has also
satisfied the third factor of the Carroll test.

4. Strength Of The Evidence
The fourth and final required factor under the Carroll test is
that  the  strength  of  the  evidence  against  the  defendant  not
be  overwhelming.  We  conclude  that,  while  there  arguably
was  sufficient  circumstantial  evidence  presented  at  trial  to
support  the  jury's  guilty  verdict, 10   this  evidence  was  not
so  strong  as  to  overcome  the  improper  and  inflammatory
comments  made  by  the  prosecutor.  Although  numerous
pieces of circumstantial evidence presented at trial seem to
suggest  that  Carter  may  have  robbed  the  Hartsville  Bank,
we do not consider the cumulative weight of this evidence
to be overwhelming, especially in the light of the evidence
suggesting  that  Terry  Johnson  may  have  been  the  robber,
not Carter. For example, evidence at trial revealed that both
Halliburton,  the  teller  who  was  robbed  at  the  bank,  and
Sergeant Lanier, who chased a suspect matching a BOLO for
Carter two days after the robbery, initially identified Terry
Johnson  as  the  robbery  suspect.  Additionally,  evidence  at
trial revealed that Terry Johnson had escaped from a prison,
*792  where he was serving time for a conviction of robbery
and carjacking, on October 1, 1996, and that Terry Johnson
was arrested in Lebanon, a town near Gallatin and Hartsville,
Tennessee, just two days after the Hartsville Bank robbery.
Evidence also showed that Terry Johnson and Carter both had
their hair in braids during the relevant period.

[13]
  In  addition  to  the  evidence  indicating  that  Johnson
may have been the robber, there also are some weaknesses
in the other evidence presented against Carter. For instance,
even  assuming  that  it  was  Carter,  and  not  Johnson,  who
fled  from  Officer  Oliver  and  Sergeant  Lanier,  the  negative
inference which can be drawn from this evidence is weakened
by the fact that Carter may have had another reason to flee

from officers: his failure to appear for a warrant against him
in  Indianapolis. 11   Therefore,  it  is  possible  that  Carter  was
fleeing because of his warrant in Indiana when he fled from
both  Sergeant  Lanier  and  Officer  Oliver,  and  not  because
he committed the bank robbery in Hartsville. Additionally,
Sergeant Lanier's testimony regarding the chase is weakened
by  the  fact  that  his  written  report  failed  to  mention  that
he  observed  an  Indiana  license  plate  and  did  not  identify
99S68881  as  an  observed  license  number.  Furthermore,  at
trial many of the witnesses providing circumstantial evidence
against Carter, including Holder, Ford, and Cornwell, could
not  identify  Carter  as  the  man  they  saw  on  the  day  of  the
robbery. Finally, although the police claim that Ms. Halcomb,
Carter's aunt, identified him as the person Ms. Ford described
in  the  Citgo  station  on  October  15,  1996,  the  evidence
shows that, contrary to a frequently used police procedure,
Ms.  Halcomb  did  not  sign  or  affirm  any  written  statement
verifying this identification.

In  sum,  in  light  of  the  evidence  suggesting  that  Johnson
perhaps may have been the Hartsville Bank robber and the
problems with some of the other evidence presented against
Carter, we conclude that Carter has also satisfied the fourth
and final factor of the  Carroll test and thus has shown the
prejudice  required  for  relief  under  a  plain  error  analysis.
See,  e.g.,  Kerr,  981  F.2d  at  1054  (reversing  on  ground  of
prosecutorial misconduct where “the testimony of the four
‘vouched’  witnesses  was  crucial  to  the  government's  case
and the prosecutor's argument” and “[o]nly indirect evidence
connected  [the  defendant]  to  the  [crime]”).  Cf.  Boyle,  201
F.3d at 717-18 (reversing for prosecutorial misconduct even
though the evidence against the defendant was strong); United
States v. Francis, 170 F.3d 546, 552 (6th Cir.1999) (same).

*793   [14]
  As  our  final  step,  we  conclude  that  the  error
here  was  of  a  magnitude  seriously  to  affect  the  fairness
and  integrity  of  judicial  proceedings.  As  noted  above,  the
prosecutor  in  this  case  failed  to  honor  his  obligation  as
a  representative  of  the  sovereign  when  he  misrepresented
critical evidence at the close of trial with no opportunity for an
argumentative response and when he made personal attacks
on opposing counsel that may have affected the jury's view
of counsel's entire defense. To hold that such action does not
seriously affect the integrity of judicial proceedings would be
tantamount to excusing the prosecutor's deliberate disregard
of his duty to uphold the Government's interest in ensuring

that “justice shall be done,” not that “it shall win a case,” and
would render a profound blow to our judicial system's ideal
of providing each defendant with a fair trial. Berger, 295 U.S.
at 88, 55 S.Ct. 629.

III. CONCLUSION

In  conclusion,  Carter  has  successfully  established  that
the  prosecutor  committed  misconduct  sufficient  to  warrant
reversal under a plain error analysis. Carter has demonstrated
that  the  prosecutor  committed  clear  and  obvious  error  by
misstating material evidence at trial and improperly accusing
defense  counsel  of  lying.  Carter  has  also  shown  that  such
misconduct  affected  the  outcome  of  the  trial.  Specifically,
Carter  has  shown  that  the  prosecutor's  improper  comments

were highly likely to mislead the jury, that the effect of the
comments was considerable, that the prosecutor deliberately
made the improper comments to the jury, and that the strength
of  the  evidence  against  him  was  not  so  overwhelming  that
it negated the improper comments made by the prosecutor.
In  sum,  because  we  believe  that  allowing  a  conviction  to
stand here where the prosecutor affected Carter's substantial
rights  by  clearly  misstating  a  key  witness's  testimony  and
repeatedly asserting that defense counsel lied during closing
arguments would pose a clear threat to the integrity of judicial
proceedings, we REVERSE the district court's judgment in
this case and REMAND for a new trial.

The Honorable Denise Page Hood, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Michigan, sitting by designation.
Terry Johnson was arrested on October 18, 1996, in Lebanon, Tennessee, which is near both Gallatin and Hartsville,
Tennessee. He had escaped from Simpson County Jail on October 1, 1996, where he was serving time for carjacking and
robbery. At the time of his arrest, Johnson had braids in his hair. As noted above, Sergeant Lanier also initially identified
Terry Johnson as the man who eluded his capture. The TV news clip on Channel 4 was based upon an interview with
Sergeant Lanier that occurred after Lanier had unsuccessfully chased the suspect in White House, Tennessee.
Halliburton's interview with Agent Whitten on December 8, 1998 took place in the presence of the prosecutor in this
case. J.A. at 51.
We note, however, that our analysis of Carter's prosecutorial misconduct claim indirectly involves an analysis of Carter's
remaining arguments, which are (1) that there was insufficient evidence from which a jury could constitutionally find Carter
guilty; (2) that the district court abused its discretion in giving a flight instruction in its charge to the jury; and (3) that the
district court abused its discretion by denying both his motion for a mistrial and his motion to strike the entire jury panel
on the ground of prosecutorial misconduct during voir dire.
As the Supreme Court stated in Berger v. United States:

The United States Attorney is the representative not of an ordinary party to a controversy, but of a sovereignty whose
obligation to govern impartially is as compelling as its obligation to govern at all; and whose interest, therefore, in a
criminal prosecution is not that it shall win a case, but that justice shall be done. As such, he is in a peculiar and very
definite sense the servant of the law, the twofold aim of which is that guilt shall not escape or innocence suffer. He
may prosecute with earnestness and vigor-indeed, he should do so. But, while he may strike hard blows, he is not
at liberty to strike foul ones. It is as much his duty to refrain from improper methods calculated to produce a wrongful
conviction as it is to use every legitimate means to bring about a just one.

Berger, 295 U.S. 78, 88, 55 S.Ct. 629, 79 L.Ed. 1314 (1935).

Other evidence that tends to weaken Halliburton's testimony includes the fact that Halliburton was first asked to view a
photograph spread of potential suspects in September of 1998, nearly two years after her initial identification and just a
few months before the trial. Furthermore, the only other black person who had even been in the courtroom during Carter's
trial was a woman, and “she [was] part of the court personnel.” J.A. at 76.
While we do not rule that it was error for the district court not to instruct the jury sua sponte of the impropriety of the
prosecutor's comments, we note our belief that the district court should have done so or at the very least, should have
called a sidebar conference with the lawyers. See Young, 470 U.S. at 10, 105 S.Ct. 1038 (“The judge ‘must meet situations
as they arise and [be able] to cope with ... the contingencies inherent in the adversary process.’ ”) (quotation omitted,

alteration in original). “A trial judge should be alert to deviations from proper argument and take prompt corrective action
as appropriate.” Kerr, 981 F.2d at 1054.
In fact, the prosecutor made improper comments at another time during the judicial proceedings. As Carter argues in
his brief, the prosecutor also made improper comments during voir dire. The events occurred as follows. The prosecutor
first questioned the jury panel:

Q: Anybody here ever been down to-not down to, but spent a lot of time in, grew up in, worked in, got relatives, close
friends in Talladega, Alabama? Pell City? All right. Ms. Qualls. Wow, I didn't think I would ring a bell on that one.

A: I have a good friend who lives in Talladega, Alabama. But I haven't seen him in a long time.
Q: Well, let me put it this way, have you had any occasions to hear about-this is 1996 now-anybody, any friends

down there who work in law enforcement?

A: No.
Q: Had any occasion to hear about a shoot-out with police back in October of 1996, down there? Does that ring a bell?
A: No.

J.A. at 294.
Following this line of questioning, defense counsel asked to approach the bench with government counsel, moved for
a mistrial, and moved to strike the entire panel on the ground that the prosecutor's questioning was prejudicial because
Carter was “not charged with a shoot-out in this case.” J.A. at 295. The district court denied the motion but instructed the
prosecutor not “to make a reference to a shoot-out or anything else that may have happened.” J.A. at 295. Not satisfied
with the court's decision, defense counsel reiterated his objection to the prosecutor's line of questioning, stating that
he felt the jury panel was affected by the questioning and that its members now knew that “this Defendant has been
charged in a shoot-out.” J.A. at 296. In response, the district court noted defense counsel's concerns but pointed out
that the jury panel did not know Carter had been charged with a shoot-out but had simply “heard something about a
shoot-out.” J.A. at 296. The court then overruled defense counsel's motion.
At conclusion of the side-bar, the prosecutor proceeded to question the jury panel about connections to Talladega
County, Alabama. What is interesting about the prosecutor's questions, however, is that, just immediately after the
court pointed out that the panel was not aware of Carter's charge in a shoot-out, the prosecutor, although not directly
mentioning or asking anything about Carter's involvement in the shoot-out, asked a question which clearly implied
Carter's involvement in a shoot-out in Talladega County. Government counsel asked, “And my question would be,
is there anything that you might have heard that might conceivably be connected with this case? ” J.A. at 296-97
(emphasis added). When viewed in the context of the prosecutor's prior questions during voir dire, this question seems
to hint indirectly to the jury that Carter was indeed involved in a shoot-out in Talladega County. Thus, the question
potentially may have prejudiced the jury panel against Carter.
In sum, as the district court recognized, the prosecutor made improper comments during voir dire by making a reference
to a “shoot-out.” In addition to this comment, the prosecutor also arguably made another improper comment when he
asked a question that implied Carter was indeed involved in a shoot-out.

In his closing argument, defense counsel stated:

MR. THORESEN: The next false trail is this picture. This picture which was broadcast on the night of October 17
by two media stations. And Terri Halliburton saw this some two days after the robbery when her memory was fresh,
when the details of this were fresh-not two years later. And she identified this man [Johnson] as being the person
who robbed her. That is a false trail. Since when is it a false trail for a witness to a crime to make an identification of
a [perpetrator]? This [Johnson] is who[m] she identified. The name Roquel Carter was used and so the Government
assumed-the  Government  assumed  that  the  picture  shown  on  Channel  4  and  the  picture  shown  on  Channel  2
was really Roquel Carter. And that assumption stayed there with the Government for two years. And when Terri
Halliburton  got  her  subpoena  to  testify  in  this  case,  she  still  had  identified  the  person  who  robbed  this  bank  as
[Johnson].

And  when  she  came  to  Nashville,  what  happened?  Was  the  respect,  given  these  circumstances,  by  letting  her
determine whether or not she had made a mistake, whether or not this was, in fact, the person who robbed the bank?
Was there a line-up conducted? Did anyone say, “Gosh, we need to get this rectified, we need to see really what is
going on here.” Instead of that happening, what happened was the statement was made, “You got the right name, but
the wrong face. You got the right name, and the wrong face.” And that comes from-that comes not from [Halliburton's]

mouth, not from the crime victim, not from the person who saw what had happened; it came from the Government's
mouth. And from that moment on, I tell you, that her testimony was poisoned.
She knew that the Government did not think this was the person who robbed her.... [This affects] the validity of the
identification made by the witness. It affects the identification, the reliability, whether it's correct or not, whether you
can rely upon it, whether you can go home with the same degree of certainty that you would apply to your ordinary
affairs to make important decisions, to rest easily as to a reasonable doubt, that this was the person who robbed the
bank. Instead of some Government agent saying, “You got the right name but the wrong face.” And isn't that a false
trail? Isn't [that] a huge false trail?
And after that, knowing that that was their opinion, letting this witness come in here and see the only black man in
this room, knowing that that is the person who the Government thought was going to be the person, and make an
identification. That seems really strange to me. And it seems really strange that Officer Lanier would do the same thing.
I don't know about lightning striking once, but I know lightning struck twice here; it struck twice in the form of Terri
Halliburton and struck twice in the same place-in the same place with respect to the testimony of Officer Lanier.... It
struck with both of these witnesses saying, within two days of this robbery occurring, that [Johnson] is the man.

* * * * * *

And before [Halliburton] was told this, there was one person [whom] she had identified as being the bank robber, and
it wasn't Roquel Carter; it was this man [Johnson]. And interestingly, that is what Officer Lanier had done.

* * * * * *

And I have a great deal of difficulty in believing [that an accused person will be treated fairly in court] when a witness
is told that you have got the right name but the wrong face before the witness hits the courtroom, before the witness
has an opportunity of seeing the person, that that is fair.

* * * * * *

There are a lot of false trails here. And these false trails are a result of the Government's behavior of what they have
specifically done in telling witnesses things and not telling them things, and not proving this case. It's the result of
a closed mind, that was closed at ten o'clock on the morning of October 15 of 1996, before this investigation ever
got started.

J.A. at 548-51, 558-59 (emphasis added).

Halliburton testified that she told the police she was certain of her identification when she initially identified Terry Johnson
as the robber. The relevant portions of the trial transcript read:
Q: .... Ms. King of our office interviewed you, is that right?
A: That's correct.

* * * * * *

Q: And you told Ms. King you were certain [that Terry Johnson, the man you saw on the TV news clip, was the

robber] when she interviewed you?

A: Yes.
Q: And you told Agent Whitten you were certain [of the same thing] when he interviewed you in November of 1996

a short time after the bank robbery, is that right?

A: Yes, sir.
J.A. at 72-73.

10 When considering the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, a reasonable juror could conclude that (1)
Ms. Colwell sold Carter the green Chrysler that was recovered by Officer Oliver; (2) Carter was the man Ms. Ford saw
enter the Hartsville Citgo station and change into coveralls shortly before the bank robbery; (3) Carter was the man whom
Ms. Cornwell saw at the carwash before the bank robbery; (4) Carter's green car was the same car that Mr. Holder saw
the robber drive away in after the robbery; (5) it was Carter who fled from both Officer Oliver and Sergeant Lanier; and
(6) Carter fled because he knew he committed the robbery at the Hartsville Bank. In sum, a rational fact finder could
decide that Carter was the man who robbed Hartsville Bank on October 15, 1996. See, e.g., United States v. Bond, 22
F.3d 662, 667 (6th Cir.1994) (holding that there was sufficient evidence for a robbery conviction where the getaway car,
a red Firebird, was identified by an individual who followed the vehicle and wrote down the license plate; the Firebird had
been stolen from a gas station in a nearby city several weeks earlier; the Firebird had a defendant's fingerprints both on
its inside and outside on the driver's side; a friend of one defendant testified that he had seen him driving a red Firebird

two or three weeks before the robbery; a music tape reported missing by the owner of the Firebird was found in one
defendant's house; ammunition for handguns, a spent shotgun shell, and stacks of cash sorted by denomination were
found in one defendant's house; a friend testified that the defendants confided in him about the robbery; and an FBI agent
testified that he overheard the defendants talking about killing a person who planned to testify against them).
The district court included the following instruction on flight in its charge to the jury:

11

INSTRUCTION:
Flight. You have received evidence that after the crime was supposed to have been committed, the Defendant,
Roquel Allen Carter, fled. If you believe from the evidence that the Defendant did indeed flee, then you may consider
this conduct, along with all the other evidence, in deciding whether the Government has proved beyond a reasonable
doubt that he committed the crime charged. This conduct may indicate that he thought he was guilty and was trying
to avoid punishment. On the other hand, sometimes an innocent person may flee to avoid being arrested, or for
some other innocent reason.

J.A. at 577.
In light of Sergeant Lanier's and Officer Hickman's testimony at trial, we do not believe it was an abuse of discretion for
the district court to give this flight instruction. Additionally, we do not believe that the flight instruction violated Carter's
right not to testify or incriminate himself. This instruction, which comes from the Sixth Circuit Pattern Jury Instructions,
does not appear to suggest guilt on the part of Carter because of his decision not to testify or explain incidents of
flight. See Committee on Pattern Criminal Jury Instructions, Pattern Criminal Jury Instructions 7.14 (1991 ed.). Rather,
the instruction states that evidence of flight may or may not indicate a defendant's guilty conscience or intent to avoid
punishment. See Illinois v. Wardlow, 528 U.S. 119, 123-27, 120 S.Ct. 673, 676-77, 145 L.Ed.2d 570 (2000) (noting
that although flight may be indicative of ongoing criminal activity, there are also innocent reasons for flight from police).

ORDER

HAWKINS, District Judge.

This  matter  is  before  the  court  on  motions  to  dismiss
the  superseding  indictment  against  defendants  LUTHER
LANGFORD  TAYLOR,  LARRY  BLANDING  and
BENJAMIN J. GORDON, JR., and the indictments against
defendants  PAUL  WAYNE  DERRICK  and  JEFFERSON
MARION  LONG,  JR.,  on  the  grounds  of  prosecutorial,
agency  and/or  investigative  misconduct.  Each  defendant  in
these cases has joined in the motions of the other defendants.
All of these defendants are back before this court for retrials
on remand from the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals.

the  motions, 

The  court  has  reviewed  each  of 
the
memorandums  in  support  of  and  in  opposition  thereto,  the
transcripts of the various hearings, and the numerous exhibits
attached  to  the  memorandums  and  filed  with  the  court  in
support of oral arguments. 1  The court is convinced that the
totality of the government's actions in these matters rises to
the  level  of  egregious  prosecutorial  misconduct,  and  that
this is a sufficient finding on which the court can exercise its
supervisory power.

A  tedious  analysis  of  the  case  law  has  not  provided  any
clear standards or guidelines for the dismissal of indictments
when the government has been found guilty of misconduct.
It does appear to be clearly established that the dismissal of
an indictment is a drastic step; however, the court believes it
has the discretion under the doctrine of the court's supervisory
power to dismiss should it find the government's actions so
outrageous as to offend the sensibilities of the court.

The  government  would  argue  that  in  using  its  supervisory
power  the  court  must  find  pattern  and  prejudice,  and  that
the  defendants  have  proven  neither.  The  court  agrees  that
the circuits are in disarray on this subject, but believes there
is  sufficient  precedent  to  dismiss  the  subject  indictments
without  addressing  these  issues.  A  fuller  discussion  *624
of its authority under the supervisory power doctrine will be
found at the conclusion of this order.

I have wrestled with some sanction short of dismissal, but find
that the only remedy available to these defendants that would
be commensurate with the misconduct of the government is
in  the  dismissal  of  these  indictments.  I  am  of  the  opinion
that  the  nature  and  breadth  of  its  misconduct  is  indicative
of the drastic steps the prosecution took to win these cases,
and that the resultant injustice to these defendants cannot be
fully remedied by new trials. Therefore, the court must take
the equally drastic step of invoking its supervisory power to
dismiss these indictments with prejudice.

I. PROCEDURAL HISTORY

These  cases  arise  from  an  FBI  investigation  of  drugs  and
corruption  in  the  South  Carolina  State  House,  code-named
“OPERATION  LOST  TRUST,”  that  eventually  involved
some twenty-eight State legislators, lobbyists and others. In
early 1988, Special Agent Michael S. Clemens of the Federal
Bureau of Investigation's Columbia, South Carolina, office,
commenced an investigation of drug violations by members
of the South Carolina State Legislature. On April 28, 1989,
a  registered  South  Carolina  lobbyist,  Ronald  L.  Cobb,  was
apprehended by the FBI after attempting to invest in a drug
deal with an undercover agent. When approached by Clemens
and other FBI agents, Cobb, realizing he had been caught in
the  commission  of  a  felony,  told  the  agents  he  could  help
them with a far more serious problem—political corruption
in  the  State  House.  The  FBI  was  in  possession  of  some
historical evidence of political corruption in the State House
at  that  time,  but  had  never  developed  sufficient  evidence
to  indict  any  legislators  or  lobbyists.  Cobb  was  given  the
opportunity to avoid prosecution for the drug deal in exchange
for becoming a paid confidential informant.

U.S. v. Taylor, 956 F.Supp. 622 (1997)

Over the next several months, the details of a sting operation
were  developed  with  Cobb's  assistance.  It  was  ultimately
determined  to  utilize  a  pari-mutuel  betting  bill  then  before
the  legislature;  to  set  Cobb  up  as  the  lobbyist  for  a  bogus
corporation known as The Alpha Group, and to have Cobb let
it be known that he had funds available for those legislators
who  would  assist  him  in  the  passage  of  this  legislation.
The  resulting  corruption  charges  of  Conspiracy  to  Commit
Extortion under Color of Official Right and Extortion under
Color of Official Right against these and some of the other
defendants  were  brought  pursuant  to  the  Hobbs  Act,  Title
18, United States Code Section 1951. Other defendants were
indicted on drug charges pursuant to various sections of Title
21, United States Code.

On  August  24,  1990,  the  first  of  the  criminal  indictments,
No.  3:90–339,  was  returned  against  defendant  LUTHER
LANGFORD  TAYLOR,  a  member  of  the  S.C.  House  of
Representatives, charging him with one count of conspiracy
to commit extortion and five substantive counts of extortion,
and ROBERT ALFRED KOHN, also a member of the S.C.
House,  charging  him  in  the  conspiracy  count.  Kohn  pled
guilty on September 26, 1990.

On September 19, 1990, Taylor 2  filed a motion to dismiss
the indictment on the grounds of prosecutorial, agency and/
or  investigative  misconduct,  which  was  heard  and  taken
under  advisement  on  September  24,  1990.  A  supporting
memorandum was filed on October 1, 1990; the government
filed its opposition on October 4th, and the motion was denied
by this court on October 9, 1990. On October 15, 1990, the
trial of Taylor commenced, and on October 25th he was found
guilty on all six counts of the indictment. Taylor's post-trial
motions were denied, and he was sentenced to seventy-eight
months on each of the six counts, the said sentences to run
concurrently. Taylor appealed his conviction. Bond pending
appeal, vigorously opposed by the government, was denied.

*625   During  this  time,  on  September  21,  1990,  a  six-
count indictment, No. 3:90–434, was returned against Ennis
Maurice  Fant,  Larry  Blanding  and  Benjamin  J.  Gordon,
also members of the State House of Representatives. These
defendants,  likewise,  filed  a  joint  motion  to  dismiss  for
prosecutorial misconduct on November 7, 1990, to which
the  government  responded  on  November  15,  1990.  The
motion  was  denied  at  a  hearing  on  November  19,  1990.

Fant  pled  guilty  to  the  conspiracy  count  of  the  indictment
on  February  22,  1991,  and  trial  proceeded  as  to  Blanding
and Gordon on February 25, 1991. On the first day of trial
Gordon  filed  another  motion  to  dismiss  for  prosecutorial
misconduct,  which  was  denied.  Guilty  verdicts  as  to  both
defendants  were  returned  on  March  7,  1991.  After  two
hearings, their motions for acquittal and new trial were denied
on  August  7,  1991.  Blanding  was  sentenced  the  following
month to thirty-seven months each on the conspiracy count
and  two  substantive  counts  of  extortion,  said  sentences  to
run concurrently, and remained on bond until he commenced
serving  his  sentence  upon  designation  by  the  Bureau  of
Prisons.  Defendant  Gordon's  sentencing  on  one  count  of
conspiracy  and  one  substantive  count  of  extortion  was
postponed as the result of contested legal issues relating to
sentencing  and,  subsequently,  the  defendant's  health.  Both
defendants appealed their convictions.

Defendant  Paul  Wayne  Derrick  was  indicted  on  February
20,  1991,  by  a  two-count  criminal  indictment  charging
conspiracy to commit extortion and extortion under color of
official right, # 3:91–0091, and went to trial on May 1, 1991.
On May 11th he was found guilty on both counts and was
sentenced to thirty-four months on each count, said sentences
to run concurrently. Derrick appealed this conviction and has
remained free on bond.

Defendant Jefferson Marion Long, Jr. was a member of the
South  Carolina  Senate  who  was  indicted  in  a  two-count
Indictment,  #  3:91–0394,  charging  conspiracy  to  commit
extortion and extortion under color of official right, on August
20, 1991. Trial commenced on November 12th; his motion
for a directed verdict was granted as to Count 1 on November
22nd, and the jury returned a guilty verdict as to Count 2 on
November 23, 1991. On March 26, 1992, this court granted
this  defendant's  motion  for  a  new  trial,  which  order  was
appealed by the government. Long has since remained free
on bond.

The  Fourth  Circuit  Court  of  Appeals  found  that  the  jury
charge given in the Taylor, Blanding and Gordon, and Derrick
cases,  to  be  in  conflict  with  the  subsequent  holdings  in
McCormick v. United States, 500 U.S. 257, 111 S.Ct. 1807,
114  L.Ed.2d  307  (1991)  (on  the  issue  of  quid  pro  quo),
and Evans v. United States, 504 U.S. 255, 112 S.Ct. 1881,
119  L.Ed.2d  57  (1992)  (on  the  issue  of  inducement),  and

unpublished  opinion,  the  Fourth  Circuit  Court  of  Appeals
affirmed  this  court's  decision  granting  a  new  trial  in  USA
v.  Long,  No.  92–6799;  1994  WL  56993  (4th  Cir.  Feb.  25,
1994).  Following  remand,  both  Taylor  and  Blanding  were
released on bond. This court then granted Gordon a new trial
on August 6, 1993. 3

On July 1, 1993, this court issued an order for a statewide
jury  to  be  selected  on  August  16,  1993,  in  the  retrial  of
Taylor. By order of August 2, 1993, trial was continued to
November 8, 1993. On August 18, 1993, the government filed
a Superseding Indictment which consolidated the Taylor case
with the Gordon and Blanding case.

Taylor  filed  on  September  29,  1993,  the  motion  now
still  pending  before  this  court  to  dismiss  the  superseding
indictment  on  grounds  of  double 
jeopardy,  claiming
prosecutorial  and/or  agency  misconduct,  which  motion
*626   the  government  opposed  on  October  6,  1993.  On
October  19,  1993,  the  trial  of  the  three  defendants  was
continued to December 6, 1993, principally due to Gordon's
health. Again on October 26, 1993, the trial was continued
to  the  first  available  term  following  January  1,  1994.
On  November  29,  1993,  however,  the  defendants  received
volumes  of  discovery  material  not  previously  furnished
them by the government. 4  As a result, Taylor filed several
supplemental Brady motions, and on February 20, 1994, he
filed a supplemental memorandum in further support of his
dismissal  motion.  Gordon  filed  his  motion  to  dismiss  on
February 22, 1994. 5

At  this  point,  the  United  States  Attorney  for  the  District
of  South  Carolina 6   sought  an  order  of  continuance  and
requested  an  investigation  by  the  Department  of  Justice's
Office  of  Professional  Responsibility  (DOJ/OPR). 7   On
October  19,  1994,  the  U.S.  Attorney  for  South  Carolina
recused  his  office  from  any  further  involvement  in  the
cases, and attorneys from the Public Integrity Section of the
Department of Justice were assigned as substitute counsel for
the government.

[1]
 On October 20, 1994, a status conference was held on
the  within  cases.  Each  defendant  joined  in  the  motions  of
the  others,  and  discovery  was  consolidated  with  regard  to
the motions only. The court established an “Evidence Room”
wherein the government 8  was ordered to place all discovery
materials and make them available to these defendants. 9

The  defendants  continued  to  file  motions  for  additional
discovery, and a hearing on Taylor's and Gordon's discovery
motions filed March 15 and 17, 1995, was held in Columbia
on April 19, 1995. This hearing resulted in the court issuing
an order filed April 20, 1995, which stated in part:

To avoid any further confusion as to what material should
and  should  not  be  turned  over  by  the  government  to  the
above defendants, it is

ORDERED,  that  all  documents  and/or  materials  in
possession of the government dealing with these cases and
not presently available to the defendants in the “evidence
room” be produced by the government directly to the court
at Charleston, South Carolina, not later than Monday, May
8, 1995, for in camera inspection by the court....

[Order, 4/20/95, pp. 2–3].

inspection  of 

Following  an  extensive 
the  documents
submitted  to  the  court,  the  court  *627   issued  its  order
on  July  25,  1995;  and,  following  later  submissions  by  the
government,  discovery  orders  were  filed  September  7  and
October 6, 1995.

On  October  18  through  20,  1995,  the  court  held  another
hearing in Columbia. At this hearing, additional government
files came to light and the defendants argued with specificity
for  reconsideration  of  portions  of  the  court's  order  of  July
25,  1995.  They  further  requested  FBI  computer-generated
printouts of the inventories of the FBI's entire “Lost Trust”
and  “Capital  Gains” 10   investigatory  files,  which  resulted
in  Taylor  filing  an  additional  motion  on  January  19,  1996.
Following  a  second  lengthy  in  camera  inspection  by  the
court,  and  in  response  to  Taylor's  January  1996  motion,
the  court  issued  an  order  on  February  6,  1996.  At  that
time, the court ordered that the hearing held in recess since
the  previous  October  be  reconvened  on  March  11,  1996,
at  which  time  all  parties  were  to  “be  prepared  to  present

U.S. v. Taylor, 956 F.Supp. 622 (1997)

and  complete  testimony  and  arguments  with  regard  to  the
motions  to  dismiss  now  pending  before  this  court.”  The
government subsequently moved on February 14, 1996, for
reconsideration  of  the  February  6th  order,  to  which  the
defendant Taylor filed an objection, and the court ruled on
this motion by order of February 23, 1996.

The  health  of  defendant  Gordon  continued  to  be  an  issue,
and his counsel sought a continuance of the March 11, 1996,
hearing date. The continuance was granted; however, on May
24, 1996, the court, following a telephone conference with
all  parties,  conditionally  severed  the  defendant  Gordon 11
and reset oral arguments on the dismissal motions for May
29, 1996. On the day prior to that scheduled hearing, May
28th, the undersigned judicial officer suffered a heart attack
and underwent angioplastic surgery on that date, and again
on  June  28th  and  August  19th.  Thus,  the  hearing  was  not
reconvened  until  October  3,  1996.  Following  a  full  day's
hearing on October 3rd, the parties were given the opportunity
to submit in writing any additional argument on matters in
evidence  on  or  before  October  18th.  The  court  received  a
letter  under  date  of  October  8,  1996,  from  the  attorney  for
Taylor, and the government filed a memorandum on October
18, 1996, to which were attached Affidavits from former U.S.
Attorney E. Bart Daniel, former Assistant U.S. Attorney Dale
L. DuTremble, and Assistant U.S. Attorney John M. Barton,
the chief prosecutors in these cases. 12  By letter under date
of October 24, 1996, to the court, Derrick's attorney lodged
a  protest  to  the  filing  of  the  three  Affidavits  as  an  attempt
by the government to add to the record after the close of the
hearing, and the court ruled that the Affidavits would not be
considered.

The  joint  motions  of  the  above  defendants  to  dismiss
the  superseding  indictment  as  to  Taylor,  Blanding  and
Gordon and the indictments as to Derrick and Long on the
grounds of double jeopardy and prosecutorial, agency and/or
investigative misconduct are now ready for a ruling by this
court.

II. DEFENDANTS' MOTIONS TO DISMISS

Some three to four weeks prior to the commencement of his
trial, Taylor filed his first motion to dismiss on the grounds
of  investigative  agency  and  prosecutorial  misconduct  in

which he charged (1) that the government's presentation to the
Grand Jury was legally insufficient and exculpatory evidence
was withheld, (2) that the conduct of the U.S. Attorney with
regard to pretrial publicity had been improper, and (3) that the
government  engaged  in  fundamentally  unfair  investigative
practices. Following a hearing and additional memorandums,
this court denied his motion. [Order, 10/9/90].

Likewise, a joint motion was filed prior to trial by defendants
Fant,  Blanding  and  Gordon  to  dismiss  for  prosecutorial
misconduct  *628  or, in the alternative, for sanctions, on the
grounds (1) that the government violated an order of the court
concerning  pre-trial  publicity,  and  (2)  that  the  government
violated  the  Code  of  Federal  Regulations  governing  the
release  of  information  in  criminal  actions  by  personnel  of
the  Department  of  Justice.  The  motion  was  denied  at  a
hearing on November 19, 1990. 13  On the day jury selection
commenced  in  the  Blanding/Gordon  case, 14   February  25,
1991,  the  defendant  Gordon  filed  a  motion  to  dismiss  for
prosecutorial misconduct on the ground that Brady material
furnished by the government only three days earlier 15  would
show that the government's key witness had perjured himself
both at the Taylor trial and before the Grand Jury and that
the government had taken no steps to correct the matter. The
motion  was  denied  by  this  court  at  a  hearing  on  March  1,
1991.

The  cases  proceeded  to  trial,  conviction,  and  remand  on
appeal.  Prior  to  retrial,  however,  on  September  29,  1993,
Taylor  filed  a  motion  to  dismiss  on  the  grounds  (1)  that
the government had withheld evidence both exculpatory in
nature and favorable to Taylor in violation of the letter and
spirit  of  the  Brady  case,  and  (2)  that  during  the  original
trial  proceedings  the  government  generated  extensive,
prejudicial pre-trial publicity, thus denying defendant a fair
trial  in  violation  of  the  double  jeopardy  clause  of  the
Fifth  Amendment  to  the  United  States  Constitution.  At  a
hearing  on  October  12,  1993,  the  court  took  the  motion
under  advisement.  On  February  12,  1994,  Taylor  filed  a
supplemental memorandum which informed the court that he
had received from the government under date of November
29, 1993, a substantial number of documents and tapes never
seen before. In the memorandum, Taylor identifies recently
received materials which he claims overwhelmingly establish
the  extent  and  scope  of  the  government's  violations  of  its
responsibilities under Brady at the time of his first trial. He

U.S. v. Taylor, 956 F.Supp. 622 (1997)

cites  to  specific  pre-trial  discovery  sought  via  five  Brady
motions.  Additionally,  he  claims  that  the  theories  of  his
defense were disclosed prior to trial so that the government
cannot claim that it failed to see the exculpatory nature of the
evidence  sought  but  not  disclosed;  that  defendant  made  an
ample, if not overwhelming, record of his Brady requests; that
rather than disclose the evidence it had which could be used to
impeach its witnesses, the government sought to preclude the
issue, and that during the trial defendant made further requests
for Brady material to which the government attorneys made
deceitful responses, thereby breaching their duty as officers
of the court.

On February 22, 1994, defendant Gordon filed his motion to
dismiss  the  superseding  indictment  on  the  grounds  (1)  that
the government intentionally withheld certain Brady material
during his first trial, (2) that the government lied to the court
about  the  existence  of  the  Brady  material,  and  (3)  that  the
government allowed perjured testimony to be presented to the
court.

Derrick filed his motion claiming prosecutorial misconduct
in the withholding of Brady materials on April 19, 1995, and
supplemented this motion on September 5, 1995.

Taylor  filed  a  Second  Supplemental  Memorandum  to  his
motion  to  dismiss  on  August  25,  1995,  in  which  he
expands  his  argument  that  the  government  was  guilty
of  outrageous  misconduct  in  that,  among  other  things,  it
failed to supervise adequately a paid government informer,
disregarded FBI regulations by questioning a target without
Miranda  warnings,  delayed  in  transcribing  interviews  of
witnesses,  allowed  false  declarations  before  the  Grand
Jury  and  false  testimony  at  trial  which  it  did  not  correct,
communicated  with  the  defendant  after  trial  without  prior
notice  to  his  counsel,  participated  in  prejudicial  pretrial
publicity,  engaged  in  a  pattern  of  conduct  calculated  to
infringe on the Grand Jury's ability to exercise independent
judgment;  *629   misrepresented  facts  proven  false  by
documents  later  found  in  the  government's  file,  failed  to
present  exculpatory  evidence  to  the  Grand  Jury,  withheld
prior exculpatory testimony and misrepresented to the court
and  the  defense  that  the  prior  testimony  existed;  tainted
the  proceedings  by  misrepresentations  and  indiscretions  of
government  agents,  failed  to  provide  proper  warning  to  a
Grand Jury target prior to his testifying before the Grand Jury,
and perjury by a government agent.

A  Third  Supplemental  Memorandum  was  filed  by  Taylor
on March 28, 1996, following access to discovery materials
furnished  by  direction  of  this  court's  order  of  February
6,  1996,  as  amended  by  order  filed  February  23,  1996.
Taylor  argues  here  that  the  new  materials  prove  (1)  that
throughout  this  sting  operation  the  government  violated
its  own  representations,  the  instructions  it  was  required  to
follow,  and  the  rules  designed  to  insure  fairness;  (2)  the
perjury of Ron Cobb and Agent Clemens, as well as the false
statements and arguments of the government attorneys, and
(3)  willful  Brady  violations.  He  further  contends  that  this
material  contains  new  Brady  material  of  which  defendants
had no prior knowledge.

The defendants previously have taken issue with the handling
of  the  investigation  by  the  Department  of  Justice  Office
of  Professional  Responsibility  (DOJ/OPR)  and  the  Federal
Bureau of Investigation Office of Professional Responsibility
(FBI/OPR)  after  the  OPR  reports  were  furnished  to  the
defendants in January of 1995. Taylor's letter submission of
October 8, 1996, includes a summary of his allegations that
the pattern of misconduct extends beyond the local FBI and
U.S.  Attorney's  offices  to  a  pattern  of  dissembling  by  FBI
Headquarters and the Department of Justice as well.

III. GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSES

TO MOTIONS TO DISMISS

The government responded on October 6, 1993, to Taylor's
motion to dismiss of September 29, 1993. These documents
were filed following remand but prior to recusal by the U.S.
Attorney for the District of South Carolina and prior to the
government furnishing additional discovery materials to the
defendant on November 29, 1993. The government's response
was prepared by AUSA Barton, who states therein:

The United States not only vehemently
denies 
these  allegations  but  also
maintains  that  even  if  true,  neither
the  Fifth
these  allegations  nor 
Amendment 
any 
basis
the  Superseding
for  dismissal  of 
Indictment in this case.

U.S. v. Taylor, 956 F.Supp. 622 (1997)

[Gov's.  Response  to  Def.  Taylor's  Motion  to  Dismiss
Indictment, 10/6/93, p. 1].

In its argument against the allegation of the suppression of
exculpatory  evidence  being  material  to  the  outcome  of  the
trial, the government states that the defendant Taylor failed
to  show  that  there  was  a  reasonable  probability  that  the
result of the trial would have been different had the evidence
been disclosed; and, further, that defendant did not make full
use of the information available to him, and thus no Brady
violation occurred. The government also argues that Taylor
has  “abjectly  failed  to  support  his  ‘extensive,  prejudicial
publicity’  assertion.”  As  to  defendant's  Fifth  Amendment
double jeopardy claim, the government relies on the finding
in United States v. Borokinni, 748 F.2d 236 (4th Cir.1984),
and concludes that, even if Taylor's alleged Brady violations
were accurately stated and that the information was willfully
withheld by the government, the Fifth Amendment's double
jeopardy would not provide a basis for the dismissal of the
indictment.

Following  the  receipt  by  defendant  of  additional  discovery
on  November  29,  1993,  as  mentioned  above,  Taylor  filed
a  supplemental  memorandum  on  February  10,  1994,  and
Gordon  filed  his  motion  to  dismiss  on  February  22,  1994;
the  matter  was  referred  to  the  DOJ/OPR  for  investigation
and  attorneys  from  the  Public  Integrity  Section,  Criminal
Division, of the DOJ were substituted for the U.S. Attorney's
Office  in  South  Carolina.  In  opposition  to  both  Taylor's
and  Gordon's  motions  and  memorandums,  an  extensive
memorandum  was  filed  on  the  government's  behalf  on
October 31, 1994, by Daniel J. Butler, Senior Trial Attorney,
and other DOJ attorneys.

*630  The Butler memorandum reiterates the government's
previous  argument  that  there  has  been  no  showing  of
intentional  government  misconduct  or  longstanding  pattern
of misconduct. The government argues that the defendants'
contentions  primarily  relate  to  the  non-production  of  two
FBI  FD–302s, 16   and  cites  to  the  Fourth  Circuit's  ruling
in  USA  v.  Taylor,  966  F.2d  at  837,  where  the  court,  in
response to the defendant's claim that the government did not
produce all evidence bearing on witness Cobb's credibility,
held  that  “...  [Taylor]  is  now  aware  of  this  evidence  and
may  use  it  as  the  Rules  of  Evidence  may  provide  at  his
retrial.”  The  government  claims  that  other  Brady  violation

claims  by  the  defendants,  such  as  Cobb's  use  of  cocaine,
witness  Robert  Kohn's 17   use  and  sale  of  cocaine,  other
video-and  audio-tapes  of  Kohn  and  other  taped  interviews
of  co-conspirators,  can  also  be  remedied  by  a  new  trial.
In  response  to  other  defense  allegations,  the  government
denies that there was any intentional misleading of the court
or  the  defendant  and  no  knowing  presentation  of  perjured
testimony.  The  government  also  makes  its  argument  as  to
the  requirement  that  the  defendants  must  show  prejudice,
which it claims they have not done, and presents an argument
against defendants' exclusive reliance on the case of United
States v. Shafer, 987 F.2d 1054 (4th Cir.1993), for dismissal
of  the  superseding  indictment  on  double  jeopardy  grounds
and against defendants' argument for dismissal based on the
court's supervisory powers.

Subsequent to the above filings and as a result of a hearing
on October 20, 1994, the “evidence room” was established as
of December 1, 1994, in which the government was directed
to make all discovery available to the defendants. Numerous
discovery  disputes  arose;  the  court  conducted  in  camera
inspections  of  documents  which  the  government  sought  to
have  excluded,  and  another  discovery  hearing  was  held  on
April 19, 1995.

Defendant Derrick then filed on that date his separate motion
to  dismiss.  On  August  25,  1995,  Taylor  filed  his  Second
Supplemental  Memorandum  in  which  he  detailed  various
other allegations of government misconduct he claims came
to  light  only  as  a  result  of  the  additional  discovery  at  his
disposal.  Derrick  also  filed  a  supplement  to  his  motion  on
September 5, 1995.

On  September  25,  1995,  the  government  responded  to
Taylor's  August  (Second  Supplemental)  memorandum.
It  summarizes  Taylor's  arguments  for  dismissal  as  (1)
nondisclosure  of  Brady  material,  (2)  misstatements  to
the  court  regarding  the  existence  of  discovery  material,
and  (3)  the  knowing  presentation  of  false  testimony.  It
incorporates  its  earlier  response  that  “under  either  an
‘outrageous'  conduct  theory  or  the  Court's  supervisory
power, a motion to dismiss requires the defendant to prove
both intentional governmental misconduct and demonstrable
prejudice.”  [Footnote  omitted].  Again,  the  government
summarizes  the  defendants'  contentions  into  three  subject
areas: (1) Taylor's response to the government's memorandum

Williams, Brooke 6/26/2015
For Educational Use Only

U.S. v. Taylor, 956 F.Supp. 622 (1997)

in  opposition  to  the  motions  to  dismiss;  (2)  the  discovery
produced since December 1, 1994, and (3) the capital gains
tax matter. The government argues specifically with regard
to  defendant  Taylor  that,  although  he  now  has  many  more
items  of  discovery  which  he  did  not  have  at  his  first  trial,
this  is  due  in  large  part  to  the  fact  that  he  now  has  all
of  the  Lost  Trust  discovery,  whether  it  relates  specifically
to  him  or  not.  The  government  again  argues  that  “the
remedy for a significant Brady violation is a new trial, not
dismissal  *631  of an indictment.” As to Taylor's allegations
of  misstatements  by  the  government  to  the  court  or  the
knowing  use  of  false  testimony,  the  government  contends
that defendant has completely failed to show bad faith on the
part of the government and has not even “begun to refute the
conclusions of the Offices of Professional Responsibility ...
for  the  Department  of  Justice  ...  and  the  FBI  which  failed
to  find  merit  in  [his]  allegations.”  The  government  also
puts  forth  the  argument  here  that  defendant  Taylor  lacks
standing  to  challenge  the  alleged  misconduct  in  trials  of
other  Lost  Trust  defendants  and  there  is  no  longstanding
pattern of government misconduct. In this memorandum the
government  also  refutes  Taylor's  allegations  as  to  various
items of evidence he claims were withheld. These items will
be dealt with with specificity later in this order.

In its response to defendant Derrick's motion, the government
also  contends  that  this  defendant  has  failed  to  show
any  intentional  misconduct  or  a  longstanding  pattern  of
misconduct or any prejudice which would warrant dismissal
of the indictment against him, and that any remedy to which
he is entitled has been granted in his impending retrial.

After  Taylor  filed  his  Second  Supplemental  Memorandum
in  August  1995,  this  court,  in  October  1995,  held  a  three-
day hearing, which resulted in a second extensive in camera
inspection and orders filed February 6 and February 23, 1996.
The  oral  arguments  by  defendants  in  October  1995  were
sufficient to convince the court that the volumes of material
that  continued  to  surface  and  their  possible  significance  to
the defendants warranted the issuance of an order directing
the  government  to  grant  access  to  the  defendants  to  many
documents previously denied to the defendants by the court.
Upon  review  of  these  documents,  Taylor  filed  his  Third
Supplemental Memorandum on March 28, 1996, to which the
government responded on April 16, 1996.

In  its  opposition,  the  government  refers  to  its  previous
opposition briefs to show that Taylor

has  failed  to  carry  his  burden  of
proving  any  intentional  government
misconduct,  let  alone  a  longstanding
pattern  of  misconduct....  Nor  has
the  defendant  demonstrated  any
prejudice  to  his  rights  that  would
affect  the  outcome  of  his  retrial
before 
this  Court.  Defendant's
Memorandum merely cobbles together
a voluminous stew of quotations from
the  government's  administrative  files
together with unwarranted speculation
and  erroneous  legal  conclusions,  all
to  support  his  theory  that  this  Court
should take the drastic and disfavored
step of dismissing an indictment.

[United  States'  Opposition  to  Def.  Taylor's  Third  Supp.
Memo, 4/16/96, p. 1].

The  government  further  responded  to  Taylor's  argument
—that  the  new  materials  prove  that  throughout  this  sting
operation  the  government  violated  its  own  representations,
the  instructions  it  was  required  to  follow,  and  the  rules
designed to insure fairness—by affirmatively stating that the
government did not violate its internal policies and by citing
to a disclaimer in the privately-published “DOJ Manual” to
which the defendant's memorandum referred. It defends its
use of the pari-mutuel betting bill for its “sting” operation and
its payments to its primary witness, Ronald L. Cobb.

As to defendant's charge of perjury by Cobb and SA Clemens,
as  well  as  false  statements  and  arguments  by  government
attorneys,  the  government  argues  that  no  document  in  the
government's files, no document quoted by the defendants,
and none of the recently disclosed materials prove that Cobb
testified  falsely,  but  only  that  the  government  agents  and
prosecutors did not agree with certain of his interpretations.

In addition, as to the third general charge by defendants of
willful  Brady  violations,  the  government  again  denies  that
any documents were willfully withheld or that the defendants
are  in  any  way  prejudiced  since  the  remedy  of  retrial  is
available. 18

Williams, Brooke 6/26/2015
For Educational Use Only

U.S. v. Taylor, 956 F.Supp. 622 (1997)

*632   In  its  Post–Hearing  Memorandum  in  Opposition  to
Defendants'  Motions  to  Dismiss,  filed  October  18,  1996,
the  government,  in  addition  to  its  legal  arguments  as  to
the defendants' burden of proof, sets out the general denial
that  there  was  no  intentional  effort  by  the  government  to
withhold discovery; that the discovery errors were, at most,
inadvertent and immaterial, and that the government did not
intentionally mislead the court about discoverable materials.
This memorandum also addresses the defendants' claims of
government-sanctioned perjury by Cobb and misconduct in
the investigation of the capital gains tax matter. It also touches
on  several  other  defense  allegations  as  will  be  more  fully
shown hereafter.

IV. THE OPEN FILE POLICY

From  the  outset,  these  cases  were  to  be  tried  under  what
is  referred  to  in  this  district  as  an  “open  file  policy.”
During  its  tenure  on  the  bench,  this  court  has  conducted
numerous  criminal  trials  under  this  policy  and  never
before  has  its  interpretation  been  so  challenged  as  in  the
government's  present  arguments.  As  a  lawyer  and  a  judge,
this  court's  experience  has  been  that  “open  file”  meant
that  the  government's  entire  discovery  file  would  be  made
available to the defendants for their examination. There are,
of course, certain documents excluded from this policy under
the  government's  internal  administrative  and  work  product
privilege.  It  has  long  been  established  that  when  an  “open
file” policy is declared, the dictates of Brady and Giglio as
well as Bills of Particular, become extraneous; all discovery
material,  except  as  limited  to  privileged  work  product,  is
made available to the defendants. This would have come as no
surprise to USA Daniel or his assistants, most of whom had
prosecuted cases before this court on numerous occasions.

As  shown  above,  motions  to  dismiss  for  prosecutorial
misconduct  had  been  filed  by  one  or  another  of  these
defendants  during  the  preparation  and  pendency  of  their
original  trials  in  1990  and  1991. 19   One  of  the  primary
grounds  on  which  those  motions  and  the  more  recent
motions  are  based  is  the  willful  withholding  of  Brady  and
other exculpatory material. The defendants have persisted in
their allegations that the government had to be withholding
evidence critical to their defense and specifically requested

some of this evidence in their discovery motions. Where it felt
appropriate, the court instructed the government to turn over
requested materials, if they existed, to the defendant. But the
government would respond by either declaring that disclosure
or unredacting of the requested documents would jeopardize
ongoing investigations or by affirmatively asserting, without
any  qualification,  that  it  had  complied  with  its  discovery
obligations.  The  existence  of  several  specific  documents
sought  by  the  defendants  was  denied  in  open  court  by  the
prosecutors and by SA Clemens under oath.

V. DISCUSSION OF THE ISSUES

The instant cases first came before the court over six years ago
with the indictment of Taylor in August 1990. The evidence
as it relates to the retrials of these defendants is in and of itself
voluminous. Together with the additional materials that relate
to the charges of prosecutorial misconduct, the record now
before the court is so vast as to make it virtually impossible to
cite to all of the allegations and counter-arguments in detail.

The  strongest  arguments  the  defendants  make  as  to  the
significance of the withholding of Brady materials and other
exculpatory evidence are found in the arguments relating to
several  of  the  issues  to  be  addressed  by  the  court  at  this
time. In addition, defendants' allegations of perjury by certain
witnesses and the government's knowledge thereof, as well as
alleged misrepresentations to the defendants, the Grand Jury
and the court, rising to the level of fraud upon the court, as
revealed by the post-remand disclosure of evidence, must also
be addressed.

1. The Withholding of Evidence as to Cobb's
Characterization of the Payments Made to Legislators.
Cobb  consistently  testified  that  he  considered  the  monies
he  gave  four  of  these  defendants  *633   to  be  bribes. 20
These  defendants  have  consistently  argued  that  the  monies
they  received  were  considered  by  them  to  be  campaign
contributions and contend that certain withheld 302s would
have served to impeach Cobb's “bribery” testimony. On June
14, 1989, an FD–302 of a Cobb debriefing was prepared by
SA  Clemens.  This  302,  which  was  not  turned  over  to  the
defendants until November 29, 1993, states on page 2:

U.S. v. Taylor, 956 F.Supp. 622 (1997)

COBB  related  that  in  regards  to  giving  money  to  State
Legislators, he routinely gives two or three hundred dollars
to some just to keep them friendly toward him.... COBB
stated that TEE FERGUSON, CHARLES A. HARVIN, III
and DONNA MOSS were among those who he would give
money. COBB indicated this money was not paid for any
specific return benefit other than having someone friendly
to him on whom he could call.
[Taylor's Supp.Memo, 2/10/94, Exh. 4, p. 2].

Again,  on  June  22,  1989,  Clemens  prepared  another  Cobb
FD–302, which did not surface until the Derrick trial. This
302 states in pertinent part:

RONALD  L.  COBB  provided  a  1989  South  Carolina
Legislative Manual in which he had checked off all those
legislators  to  whom  he  had  paid  money.  When  asked  if
these were bribe type payments or campaign contributions
COBB replied, “That's a hard question to answer.” COBB
was  then  asked  if  those  checked  off  were  persons  he
had  given  two,  three,  or  four  hundred  dollars  to  for  no
specific  reason  other  than  to  maintain  favorable  contact
with COBB. COBB indicated that this was the case, and
indicated  he  would  give  the  money  to  the  legislator  and
that  was  it.  If  the  individual  then  wanted  to  claim  it  as
a  campaign  contribution  and  report  it  or  just  stick  it  in
his pocket, that was of no concern to COBB. [Emphasis
added].

[Taylor's Supp.Memo 2/10/94, Exh. 1]

The  names  of  each  of  the  within  defendants  are  shown  as
“checked off” in the Legislative Manual; however, the listing
of names with check marks next to them includes the names
of  numerous  other  legislators  who  were  never  targeted  or
indicted by the government in the Lost Trust investigation. 21

On  July  26,  1989,  another  Cobb  FD–302  was  prepared  by
Clemens  and  was  only  turned  over  to  the  defendants  after
the  issuance  of  this  court's  November  8,  1994,  order.  The
following information is contained therein:

COBB was asked about the manner in which he would pay
legislators several hundred dollars. COBB stated that this
was sometimes accomplished with cash, and sometimes by
check, either from his business or personal account. COBB
advised  that  sometimes  payments  were  made  at  official

fund raisers and sometimes in a social setting as a token of
appreciation for support on something.

COBB stated that sometimes a legislator will drop a hint
that  money  is  tight  and  that  they  could  use  some  cash.
COBB  *634   added  that  if  it  was  someone  who  was
friendly toward his interests he would take care of them
with a few hundred dollars. COBB emphasized that he did
not know and did not care how they handled or reported
the money. COBB's sole interest was to gain friends and
supporters of his interests.

[Hearing, 10/18–20/95, Taylor Exh. 3].

This  language  from  these  three  FD–302s  is  used  by  the
FBI–Columbia  Office  almost  verbatim  in  its  Undercover
Operation Proposal (UCO) dated September 5, 1989 [Taylor's
Third  Supp.  Memo,  3/28/96,  Exh.  1,  p.  13],  seeking
authorization for this undercover operation. The government,
therefore,  was  totally  familiar  with  the  existence  of  these
302s, yet it did not turn them over to the defendants for use
at trial.

Reference in the above-quoted FD–302 of July 26, 1989, to
payments  being  made  to  legislators  “sometimes  by  check,
either  from  his  business  or  personal  account,”  prompted
requests  from  the  defendants  for  Cobb's  financial  records.
At  the  final  hearing  on  the  instant  motions  on  October  3,
1996, testimony was elicited on direct examination of Mrs.
Rhonda Collins 22  that the defendants were furnished with the
records of Cobb's business account—Government Business
Associates,  Inc.—in  or  about  May  1995.  She  stated  that
copies  of  nine  (9)  checks  payable  to  various  legislators  in
amounts between $100 and $650 23  have been found in these
records. Mrs. Collins further stated that the defendants had
never  been  furnished  copies  of  Cobb's  personal  financial
records.  The  defendants  argue  that  the  nine  checks  in
increments  of  $100  to  $650  corroborate  the  information
quoted above from the FD–302s of June 14, 1989, June 22,
1989,  and  July  26,  1989,  and  that  this  information  would
have served to refute Cobb's testimony at the trials that the
payments he made to these defendants were definitely known
by them to be bribes. [See Hearing Tr., 10/18–20/95, pp. 56–
66].

In  its  Post–Remand  Memorandum,  the  government  argues
that the financial records of Government Business Associates

Williams, Brooke 6/26/2015
For Educational Use Only

U.S. v. Taylor, 956 F.Supp. 622 (1997)

were submitted to the court for in camera inspection and that
the court's order of July 25, 1995, held that the government
need not provide these records to the defendants, but that upon
resubmission the court ordered that the records be provided to
the defendants on September 7, 1995. It is the government's
contention that this reflects the “less than clear nature of the
discoverability of certain documents in this matter, especially
these checks.” A reading of this court's September 7th order,
however, simply shows an admission by the court that it did
not properly identify the photostatic copies of bank statements
and  canceled  checks  on  this  account  in  the  first  in  camera
submission  of  eleven  file  boxes  of  material  under  review.
More  importantly,  however,  the  question  is  not  why  these
records  were  not  furnished  in  1994  or  1995,  but  why  they
were not furnished to the defendants prior to their initial trials
in 1990 and 1991.

In addition to the above, defendants cite to the withholding
of  302s  on  James  Faber,  Frank  Earl  McBride,  and  Ennis
Maurice  Fant,  all  dated  July  18,  1990,  in  which  each  of
them  stated  they  believed  the  monies  they  received  from
Cobb  to  be  campaign  contributions.  [Taylor's  Motion  to
Dismiss,  9/23/93,  Exhs.  13–15].  These  302s  were  derived
from interviews conducted by the FBI simultaneously with
the FBI's initial interview of defendant Taylor. 24  All four of
these defendants  *635  (Taylor, Faber, McBride and Fant),
as well as others, were approached in a “sweep” by the FBI
of targets of the Lost Trust investigation and must have been
considered all part of the same case. Even had the defendants
not  been  able  to  utilize  these  302s  at  trial  as  statements  of
unavailable  witnesses,  as  argued  by  the  government  in  its
Post–Hearing Memorandum, it is the opinion of the court that
these 302s should have been provided as relevant discovery
material.

Cobb  testified  that  after  he  had  been  set  up  by  the  FBI
as  a  lobbyist  for  the  bogus  Alpha  Group  in  order  to  catch
legislators  accepting  bribes  for  their  support  of  the  pari-
mutuel  bill,  he  sought  the  help  of  defendant  Taylor  in
recruiting black legislators and the help of Kohn in recruiting
white  legislators.  Taylor  argues  in  his  memorandum  of
February 10, 1994, that taped conversations between Cobb
and Kohn

go to the vital issue of whether or not
the government was running a sting to
catch  crooked  legislators  or  whether,

on the other hand, Cobb was trying to
make it appear that he could buy votes
from  legislators  other  than  Senator
Lindsay  in  an  effort  to  save  himself
from  the  consequences  of  numerous
illegal  acts  for  which  he  could  be
prosecuted.

[Taylor's Supp. Memo, 2/10/94, p. 9].

Taylor was a co-sponsor of the pending pari-mutuel bill and
sat on both the Labor, Commerce & Industry Committee of
the House of Representatives and the Banking and Consumer
Affairs Sub–Committee. Prior to the institution of the sting
operation, the pari-mutuel bill had successfully passed these
committees.  Taylor  contends  that  his  continued  support  of
the bill was not an explicit quid pro quo. He argues that this
is corroborated on a tape recorded conversation of January
16,  1990  (Tape  #  14),  on  which  Kohn  is  heard  to  remark:
“...  we  got  the  thing  out  of  committee  with  no  one  doing
anything..... No money, and you know, just, just doin' for the
issue.” [Taylor's Supp. Memo, 2/10/94, Exh. 9, p. 2]. Taylor
further argues that this same tape shows that, in spite of FBI
instructions  to  Cobb  to  be  explicit  about  the  quid  pro  quo
aspect of his payments to legislators, Cobb felt the need to be
far more subtle in his approach. In encouraging Kohn to bring
supporters to him, Cobb instructed Kohn:

You know how to, I mean you know
how to work it and cover us, I mean,
we don't want come over there and say
well, here, they're gonna buy the damn
thing.

[Id. at p. 4]

On an audio tape of April 5, 1990 (Tape # 75), Kohn tells
Cobb:

(UI)I'm not trying to hold back, I mean I realize (UI) I ain't
trying to play that game. (UI)I've been asked for gold coins.
If it doesn't look like money should be brought up, I don't
do it to hold back money, I just don't think it's good to bring
it up (UI). I use (UI) some of them I just casual comment
about  a  contribution  to  their  campaign  ‘cause  see  if  you
have to do that I can write a check and tell them I think their
[sic] a good spirited citizen (UI).

U.S. v. Taylor, 956 F.Supp. 622 (1997)

[Id.,  Exh.  12,  p.  13].  The  transcript  of  this  tape  is  made  a
part  of  an  FD–302,  which  states  that  this  audiotape  is  of
a  telephone  conversation  Cobb  has  with  a  Wade  “Ronnie”
Crow, 25  followed by a meeting with Faber, McBride, Kohn,
Taylor and one Rachel Harper. Taylor is shown to speak only
once, and it is impossible for the court to ascertain whether
he was present at the time the above statement was made by
Kohn. His name, however, does appear in the cover  *636
FD–302, yet he was not furnished this tape or the FD–302 and
transcription prior to his trial.

These tapes, as well as the numerous other audio and video
tapes  furnished  to  the  defendants  on  November  29,  1993,
certainly  must  be  viewed  as  exculpatory  evidence  which
could have been used to further the defense put forth by these
defendants  that  they  considered  the  monies  they  received
from Cobb to be campaign contributions.

In  this  order  the  court  cites  allegations  primarily  from  the
arguments, memorandums and exhibits of defendants Taylor,
Blanding  and  Gordon.  In  fact,  with  regard  to  the  timing
of  their  trials  and  evidence  not  furnished  to  them  for  their
defenses, their positions are closely related. Derrick was the
defendant  in  the  third  Lost  Trust  trial,  and  some,  although
by  no  means  all,  of  the  previously  withheld  evidence  was
available to him and defendant Long for their trials. 26

Defendant Derrick also presented additional testimony at his
trial  that  the  monies  he  received  from  Cobb  were  used  to
produce  a  semi-annual  newsletter  to  his  constituents.  The
government objected to the admission into evidence of a copy
of the newsletter he had published in the spring prior to his
indictment on the grounds that it had never received a copy of
that newsletter, that it was hearsay, and that it was irrelevant.
Paul  Derrick  affirmatively  stated  at  trial  that  he  had  given
a copy to the government. At a hearing on April 19, 1995,
Derrick disclosed that “we have just recently discovered in the
most recent documents an FBI 302. Guess what is attached to
it? That news letter. They had it.... We didn't get to get that in
during the trial.” [Hearing Tr., 4/19/95, p. 37].

Defendant  Long  is  presently  before  this  court  for  a  new
trial  granted  him  by  this  court,  which  decision  was  upheld
on  appeal.  At  the  conclusion  of  the  Long  trial,  this  court
dismissed  one  count  against  Long;  however,  tapes  ruled

pertinent only to the dismissed count inadvertently had been
allowed to go to the jury room. Long, however, has joined
in the motions for dismissal on the grounds of prosecutorial
misconduct as the motions may relate to him. 27

At  the  motions'  hearing  in  October  1995,  Long  cross-
examined Cobb concerning his testimony at Long's trial that
when  Cobb  gave  Long  the  money  in  question  in  this  case,
Long  had  no  idea  that  it  was  a  bribe.  The  transcript  from
October 19, 1995, reads:

Q.  That  he  would  have  thought  that  you  were  simply
helping him out of his financial difficulties, and it was not
related  to  any  legislation  pending  in  the  South  Carolina
Legislature; is that correct?

A. That's correct, yes, sir.

Q. Specifically the pari-mutuel bill?

A. Yes, sir.

Q.  And  the  pari-mutuel  bill,  as  a  matter  of  fact,  was
something  that  Bud  Long  had  always  supported;  is  that
correct?

A. Yes, sir.

Q.  As  I  understand  it,  it  is  your  position  that  Bud  Long
never had the intent to accept a bribe?

A. That's correct.

Q. And that you led him to believe, or did not lead him to
believe other than it was just some money from a friend to
help him out of his financial difficulties?

A. He was in a tight, [sic] and he had been very valuable in
assisting me in getting clients, and I had given Bud money
from time to time, and he could very easily have thought
that this was one of those situations. As a matter of fact, I
think he even told me to make sure—I think he may have
looked at it as a contribution, because he told me one time
to make sure that I thank my people for the contribution.

U.S. v. Taylor, 956 F.Supp. 622 (1997)

Q.  Now,  let  me  ask  you  this,  which  I  was  not  able  to
ask  at  the  trial,  because  I  did  not  know  about  that  until
the trial, prior to the meeting ever being arranged or your
discussion  with  Bud  Long  concerning  this  money,  did
you  communicate  to  the  F.B.I.  that  it  was  unfair  to  put
Bud  Long  in  that  position,  because  of,  number  one,  his
financial  difficulties;  and,  number  two,  because  of  your
unique relationship with him, he would not understand and
not realize it was a bribe?

A. Yes, sir, I did; also, to the U.S. Attorney's Office.

Q. This is prior to it ever coming about?

A. That's correct.

[Hearing Tr., 10/19/95, Vol. II, pp. 32–3].

Cobb  further  testified  that  in  the  time  frame  prior  to  the
exchange of money with Long, he voiced the same concern to
AUSA Alfred W. (Buddy) Bethea, SA Clemens, USA Daniel,
and AUSA Barton; but, in spite of his protestations on more
than one occasion, SA Clemens instructed him to go ahead
and meet with Long. [Id. at p. 34]. He further testified that
he  repeatedly  told  AUSA  Bethea,  who  was  to  be  the  lead
prosecutor for the Long trial, that Long would have had no
reason to believe that the money he was accepting from Cobb
was bribe money. When asked for AUSA Bethea's reaction,
he stated:

His reaction was one of he had made
up  his  mind  that  Bud  Long  was
guilty, he wanted to try him, he hadn't
participated  in  any  of  the  trials,  and
he  was  more  gung  ho,  I  think,  about
trying the case than anything else. We
had a very strong disagreement in this
regard.

[Id. at pp. 40–1].

When Cobb testified to the above on direct examination by
AUSA John W. McIntosh at Long's trial, McIntosh personally
refused  to  proceed  with  the  prosecution;  and  USA  Daniel,
who had not been part of the trial prosecution team, replaced
him for the balance of the trial.

2. The Capital Gains Tax Investigation and Ronald L.
Cobb.
Cobb  has  been  previously  identified  in  this  order  as  the
government's  key  confidential  informant  employed  in  the
sting  operation.  Cobb  was  a  former  member  of  the  South
Carolina  State  Legislature  and  a  licensed  lobbyist.  He
maintained  throughout  these  cases  that  he  was  a  close
personal  friend  of  Lindsay,  who  was  undisputedly  one  of
the  most  powerful  men  in  State  government.  Lindsay  was
a  member  of  the  Senate  Conference  Committee  appointed
to  negotiate  the  differences  between  the  Senate  and  House
versions of the 1988 Appropriations Bill, in which a capital
gains  tax  “rollback”  provision  had  been  included  as  a
“proviso.”

Prior to his trial, Taylor had received a substantially redacted
FD–302  of  an  interview  of  lobbyist  J.  Randal  Lee  by  SA
Clemens and SA Thomas J. Davis conducted August 14–21,
1990. [Hearing, 10/18–20/95, Gordon Exh. G]. Taylor argued
that  he  was  entitled  to  place  Cobb's  credibility  before  the
jury and that to do so he would need to review documents
he believed to be in the government's possession, and to be
furnished  the  identity,  which  had  been  redacted  from  the
documents  furnished,  of  various  elected  officials  to  whom
Cobb had made payoffs. A transcript of a pre-trial motions
hearing  on  October  11,  1990,  reveals  Taylor's  argument
that  “nothing  is  more  relevant  to  this  whole  case  than  the
credibility  of  Mr.  Ron  Cobb.”  [Hearing  Tr.,  10/11/90,  pp.
37–42].  Apparently,  the  Fourth  Circuit  Court  of  Appeals
agrees. 28

Some  six  days  prior  to  the  Blanding/Gordon  trial,  the
government turned over to those defendants the unredacted
FD–302  dated  August  14–21,  1990  [Taylor's  Supp.Memo,
2/10/94,  Exh.  7],  which  disclosed  that  Lindsay's  name  had
been  redacted  in  the  version  furnished  Taylor.  This  302
discusses  *638  at length the South Carolina Capital Gains
Tax  bill  initiated  in  1988  (the  “proviso”),  and  puts  the
government on notice of alleged bribe payment arrangements
involving Richard E. Greer, Chairman of the South Carolina
State Development Board, Lindsay, Cobb, and various other
persons.

Also during the Blanding/Gordon trial, on February 22, 1991,
as  the  result  of  a  court  order  of  February  14,  1991,  the
government furnished the Blanding/Gordon defendants with

U.S. v. Taylor, 956 F.Supp. 622 (1997)

an unredacted FD–302 of an interview of Cobb by FBI SA
Arthur Richards dated May 1, 1989, which revealed Lindsay's
involvement in payoffs regarding legislation known as the Oil
Jobbers bill. At a hearing on Blanding and Gordon's motions
to dismiss for prosecutorial misconduct filed on February
25, 1991, and heard February 28, 1991, Richards confirmed
under oath Cobb's understanding that the debriefing on May
1,  1989,  concerned  “payoffs  and  kickbacks  and  extortion.
We  were  talking  about  payoffs.”  [Gordon's  Motion  to
Dismiss,  2/22/93,  Exh.  C,  p.  120].  Richards  testified  that
he  debriefed  Cobb  prior  to  and  after  he  administered  a
polygraph  examination.  On  direct  examination  by  Gordon,
Richards related that Cobb initially failed the polygraph test
he was administering to him concerning the Oil Jobbers bill,
testifying as follows:

A.  ....  He  [Cobb]  said  that  through  an  intermediary,  that
he  initially  would  not  identify,  he  paid  Representative
Mangum [sic] 29  $10,000 in order to get his vote. That was
the first issue that I polygraphed.

Q. Okay. Now the issue that you polygraphed him on was
whether or not he in fact paid representative Mangum the
$10,000 through the intermediary.

A. That's correct.

Q. All right, sir. And he tested truthful on that?

A. He did not. He failed that polygraph examination.

Q. What happened after that?

A. Then after he failed it, he was confronted with the fact
that he had failed it. And he said that he had—that there
was another person involved, this intermediary, and that
that intermediary also got some money. But he would
not at that point, without certain assurances, would not
disclose the identity of the intermediary.

....

Q. And because he hadn't divulged to you that there was
another party involved, Senator Lindsay—

A. Exactly.

Q. —he showed deception?

A.  He  showed  deception.  At  that  point,  I  put  him  on
the  telephone  with  Agent  Clemens,  and  together  they
worked  out  an  arrangement  where  the  government,  if
he gave us the identity of the intermediary, where the
government  would  not  use  his  statement  against  that
intermediary,....

....

A. Okay. After it was worked out and it was agreeable to
Agent Clemens and agreeable to Mr. Cobb, at that point he
wrote down “Jack Lindsay” on a sheet of paper. I'm talking
about Mr. Cobb—showed it to me, and then crumpled the
piece of paper up and threw it in the trash can.

....

Q.  And  when  you  tested  him  about  the  payoff  to
Representative  Mangum,  after  he  divulged  to  you  that
Senator Lindsay was the intermediary, how did Mr. Cobb
do?

A. He passed the second test.

[Id.  at  pp.  111–19].  This  testimony  alone  refutes  the
government's  argument  that  “Cobb  has  consistently
adhered  to  his  subjective  view  of  the  facts  during  the
investigation ... [Gov's Post–Hearing Memo, 10/18/96, p.
23],  and  that  “the  defendants  do  not  and  cannot  show
perjury by Cobb as to his subjective beliefs, ... [Id. at p. 26].
At this same hearing on February 28, 1991, Gordon furthered
the argument that, if the government had any 302 regarding
Cobb's payoffs to Lindsay, the defendants were entitled “to
know  if  they  have  talked  to  *639   Mr.  Cobb  and  he's
indicated  these  illegal  payoffs.”  To  this,  the  government
replied:  “...  if  he's  looking  for  the  secret  302  of  Ron  Cobb
where this is discussed, it does not exist. There is no such 302
concerning that.... But there are no 302's or statements from
Cobb  concerning  this  particular  instance  involving  capital
gains tax.” [Id. at p. 11–2].

At this hearing, SA Clemens was also examined under oath
by Gordon as to the existence of any FD–302s Clemens might
have  prepared  concerning  Cobb's  involvement  with  capital
gains. The record reads as follows:

U.S. v. Taylor, 956 F.Supp. 622 (1997)

Q.  Mr.  Clemens,  I  know  you  said  you  only  briefly
discussed  it,  but  apparently  y'all  had  some  discussion
about Ron Cobb's involvement with the capital gains tax
legislation. Did you do a 302 or anything concerning that
debriefing of Mr. Cobb?

A. No.

Q. Do you have any rough notes of it?

A. No....

[Id., Exh. D, p. 36–7].

Mr.  Barton  concluded  on  this  subject  with  the  statement:
“There  are  three  302's  and  two  volumes  of  Grand  Jury
testimony,  that  is  the  only  thing  that  the  government  has
from  Mr.  Cobb.”  [Id.,  Exh.  C,  p.  18].  As  mentioned
elsewhere in this order, copies of checks from Cobb's business
account  payable  to  Lindsay  were  also  in  possession  of  the
government, but they were not furnished to the defendants at
that time. Although Cobb testified that he sometimes wrote
checks to legislators from his personal account, there is no
evidence the government ever sought to obtain these records.

On November 29, 1993, following remand of these cases for
retrial, the government furnished for the first time an FD–302
of an interview of Cobb by SA Clemens dated September 25,
1989, in which the payments to Lindsay by Cobb with regard
to the capital gains tax bill were characterized as “payoffs.”
This is the “secret” FD–302 that's existence was previously
denied by the government. This 302 was found by defendants
in the November 29, 1993, discovery in a file marked “KOHN
1” and is one of the two undisclosed 302s on which the Office
of Professional Responsibility (OPR) Report focused.

The defendants take the position that SA Clemens' testimony
that he had never prepared such a 302 was perjury and that
the prosecutors were fully aware of the existence of that 302
and allowed the testimony to stand. SA Clemens explained
to OPR investigators that he “forgot it ever existed”, calling
it  a  “garbage  302,”  [Hearing,  4/19/95,  Defs.  Exh.  45,  pp.
32–3] and the government argues that this testimony should
be excused inasmuch as this was Mr. Clemens' first time to
testify at a trial. This is refuted by the defendants' argument
that every witness is expected to tell the truth, regardless of
whether or not it is their first time to testify. 30

During  the  OPR  investigation,  it  was  disclosed  that  rough
notes  of  the  interview  which  led  to  the  302  of  September
25,  1989,  had  been  taken  by  SA  Clemens  to  his  home  in
the  Washington,  D.C.,  area  when  he  was  promoted  and
transferred  to  FBI  Headquarters  from  Columbia,  S.C. 31
These notes were eventually provided by Clemens to the OPR
in 1994 during its investigation.

For this and several other infractions of FBI regulations, SA
Clemens  received  a  letter  of  censure,  a  five-calendar-day
suspension, and six months' probation.

At the Taylor trial, Cobb was asked on cross-examination:

Mr. Cobb, I want you to tell me right now whether or not
you  have  ever  given  bribes  or  illegal  money  to  Senator
Lindsay?

Answer:  No,  sir,  I  have  not  given  Senator  Lindsay  any
bribes or illegal money.

[Taylor Trial Tr., Vol. 3, p. 56].

The defendants argue that the government knew at that point
in  time  that  Cobb  was  *640   committing  perjury  and  they
allowed  this  perjurious  testimony  to  stand  and  to  continue
throughout the subsequent trials.

The government responds that, although it may have believed
the payments of monies by Cobb to Lindsay were illegal, that
Cobb's  testimony  could  not  be  considered  perjury  because
Cobb, himself, did not believe the monies to be illegal. The
evidence now shows, however, that Cobb not only discussed
payoffs in connection with the capital gains tax bill with SA
Clemens, with Greer, and in the presence of Randy Lee, all of
whom knew that the Cobb payments to Lindsay were, in fact,
illegal, but he admitted to SA Richards on May 1, 1989, that
he paid $20,000 in illegal monies to Lindsay and Magnum for
their influence in passing the oil jobbers bill.

Also in the record is a sworn Affidavit from SA Ronald L.
Dick, who acted as the supervising agent at FBI–Columbia
for  much  of  this  investigation,  which  affirms  defendants
allegations  that  the  government  was  totally  aware  of  the
nature  of  the  Cobb  payments  to  Lindsay.  In  his  Affidavit,
Dick states:

U.S. v. Taylor, 956 F.Supp. 622 (1997)

I recall the subject of the capital gains
tax  bill.  My  recollection  is  that  there
were other cooperating witnesses who
were providing information regarding
this  issue.  However,  Cobb  would
never allow the payments Cobb made
to  state  senator  Jack  Lindsay  to  be
characterized  as  bribes.  My  position
on  this  matter  was  similar  to  the  old
saying  that  if  it  walks  like  a  duck,
talks  like  a  duck,  and  looks  like  a
duck,  then  it  must  be  a  duck.  After
listening  to  Cobb  try  to  characterize
the  payments  made  to  Lindsay  as
anything other than bribery, I remain
unconvinced. As an FBI agent, it was
clear  to  me  that  the  monies  paid  to
Lindsay by Cobb were in violation of
the Hobbs Act. Cobb, however, would
never  allow  these  transactions  to  be
characterized  as  bribes.  This  was  the
subject  of  much  discussion  between
SSA Clemens, myself and the USAO
Office.

[Dick Affidavit to DOJ/OPR, 7/12/94].

A  review  of  the  UCO  for  the  Lost  Trust  sting  operation,
then  code-named  Phaedrus,  prepared  by  FBI–Columbia  in
September 1989 [Taylor's Third Supp.Memo, 3/28/96, Exh.
1, p. 10], reflects that almost the identical wording was used
in the UCO as that in SA Richards' FD–302 of May 1, 1989.
[Hearing, 10/18–20/95, Taylor Exh. 2]. The names of both
then-Supervising Agent in Charge James F. Denton, III, and
SA Clemens appear on the Airtel which transmitted the UCO
to FBI Headquarters.

The government maintains that it was absolutely necessary
to  redact  Lindsay's  name  from  both  SA  Richard's  FD–
302  of  May  1,  1989,  and  from  Randy  Lee's  FD–302  of
August  14–21,  1990,  to  protect  an  on-going  investigation.
However,  it  is  difficult  to  reconcile  this  reasoning  with
SA  Clemens'  interpretation  that  Cobb's  reference  to  pay-
offs  to  Lindsay  were  part  of  a  “garbage  302”  or  with
the  testimony  of  SA  Dick.  Furthermore,  the  FBI  relied  in
part on this information for authority to instigate the entire

sting operation. The court simply cannot disregard Lindsay's
prominent  position  in  the  politics  of  South  Carolina  and
the  obvious  importance  to  both  the  FBI  and  the  AUSO  of
information that he was involved in corruption. The explosive
nature of that information, as well as information that Rogers,
the  Speaker  of  the  House,  and  Greer,  the  Chairman  of  the
State Development Board and, undisputedly, a close friend
of  Governor  Carroll  A.  Campbell,  Jr.,  were  also  involved,
is revealed in an August 28, 1990, teletype sent from FBI–
Columbia to FBI–Headquarters which requested authority for
lobbyist Randy Lee to utilize electronic recording devices to
monitor anticipated conversations with Greer. Greer, Lindsay
and Rogers are the captioned subjects. That teletype reads in
part:

This  request  will  require  DOJ  authority  as  sensitive
circumstances exist in that captioned subjects are members
of the South Carolina Legislature and high ranking State
government employees. Three CWs hereafter referred to
as CW–1 [Lobbyist Lee], CW–2 [Senator Lee] and CW–
3 [Cobb] have provided information that bribe payments
were made to South Carolina State Representatives John
Irby Rogers, III, and South Carolina State Senator  *641
John  Charles  Lindsay,  in  order  to  ensure  the  passage  of
certain  capital  gains  tax  legislation  in  the  State  of  S.C.
during the 1988–1989 legislative session.

....

AUSA  John  Barton  is  aware  of  the  facts  of  this  case
and fully concurs with the use of consensual monitoring.
Entrapment is not an issue based upon the facts obtained
thusfar [sic].
[Hearing, 10/18–20/95, Gordon Exh. T].

These were “big fish,” yet on February 28, 1990, Clemens
testified  concerning  debriefings  of  Cobb  about  the  capital
gains tax matter that he had only “talked to him for a short
period  of  time  to  get  a  general—general  idea  of  what  had
gone on.” [Gordon's Motion to Dismiss, 2/22/90, Exh. D, p.
37]. AUSA Barton was handling the discovery for the Taylor
trial, and any 302 mentioning any one of these three subjects
would certainly have been noticed by him, yet he denied the
existence of the “secret 302.”

U.S. v. Taylor, 956 F.Supp. 622 (1997)

Trust matter, the court relied on the repeated representations
by  the  government  as  officers  of  the  court,  that  all  the
discovery  to  which  the  defendants  were  entitled  had  been
turned  over  to  them.  The  court  is  shown  to  have  advised
Taylor  at  his  pretrial  hearing:  “Well,  based  on  what  Mr.
DuTremble tells the court, you know, I don't know that they
have anything else to give you, sir.” [Taylor Trial Tr., p. 54].
The court then stated:

them 

answers 

[the  United  States
...  when  he 
[Brady
Attorney] 
motion requests], and he's an attorney,
signs his name down there, you know,
just  because  he  is  a  United  States
attorney, doesn't stop him from being
an attorney, then I accept that just like I
do any other attorney's signature. And
they know what the ramifications are
if they don't—done in accordance—.

[Id. at p. 59]

Just  prior  to  Cobb's  testimony  at  the  Taylor  trial,  Taylor
received a copy of Cobb's agreement with the FBI, the USAO,
and  the  Office  of  the  Attorney  General  of  South  Carolina.
Taylor  renewed  his  Brady  motion  that  he  be  provided  the
actual details of all the crimes for which Mr. Cobb had been
immunized under this agreement. The court, assuming that
the  government  had  disclosed  all  it  had  a  duty  to  disclose,
addressed Taylor's counsel as follows:

...  you  know  as  much  about  the
government's case as the government
knows.  Supposedly  they  have  given
you  everything  they  have  short  of
which  they  have  not  told  you  which
witnesses  they  are  going  to  call  and
what  have  you.  Other  than  that,  you
have everything they have. I just don't
know  what  it  is  you  think  I  can  do
about it.

[Id. at p. 9]. Taylor, at this point in time, however, had none
of the government's evidence of Cobb's pay-offs to Lindsay.

At  the  February  28,  1991,  hearing,  after  AUSA  Barton's
denial  of  the  existence  of  the  “secret”  302,  the  court
admonished:

...  all  I  can  do  is  take  them  at
their word, because they have always
performed  like  most  officers  of  the
court  do....  And  Mr.  Barton  just  said
there  are  no  302's  dealing  with  these
matters which you talk about. And we
are all aware that there are all kinds of
ongoing investigations, and I'm sure if
they already had them, he would have
them and he would at least tell me that
he  had  them  and  give  them  to  me  to
look at and see if I thought he ought to
have to give them to you.

[Gordon's Motion to Dismiss, 2/22/93, p. 14].

Later in that same hearing, the court stated:

I have already told them to give you everything they have,
and I don't know how I can do better than that. Now, if you
find out they didn't give you what they had, then I will take
appropriate steps there.

....

Mr.  Barton  has  been  trying  to  tell  us  from  the  time  we
got started, kept standing up and I kept sitting him down,
and then I was confident he was going to say, “We have
given them everything we have,” and  *642  that is what he
eventually said. [Emphasis added].
[Id. at p. 17].

Although  the  record  will  reflect  that  other  questionable
government conduct surfaced with regard to the handling of
the Lindsay matter, the government's problems with Lindsay's
involvement  were  mooted  by  his  death.  Rogers  eventually
pled. The record as to Greer, however, must be addressed.

3. The Capital Gains Tax Investigation and Richard E.
Greer.
Greer was initially implicated in the Lost Trust investigation
by  the  August  1989  FD–302  of  lobbyist  Randy  Lee.  Lee's
FD–302,  which  resulted  from  interviews  conducted  by  the
FBI on August 14 through 21, 1990, reads in pertinent part
as follows:

U.S. v. Taylor, 956 F.Supp. 622 (1997)

LEE stated he recalled GREER saying “It is very big, it
is important to a lot of people—it would help a lot of the
Governor's  friends.”  Lee  stated  that  as  the  conversation
continued,  it  became  obvious  to  him  that  GREER  had
arranged for several wealthy individuals, who were staunch
supporters of Governor CARROLL CAMPBELL, to invest
a large amount of money to affect the rollback. LEE stated
the  money  to  be  invested  by  several  of  the  participants,
arranged by GREER, would be paid as a bribe to insure
that the rollback would take place.... LEE stated he learned
that ROE, BRASIER and possibly a third party, had been
quoted  a  fee  of  seventy-five  thousand  dollars  each,  by
GREER.  LEE  stated  he  either  heard  GREER  mention
this  amount  during  the  initial  conversation,  or  at  a  later
date;  however,  it  was  later  explained  to  him  by  COBB.
LEE  stated  he  has  never  been  certain  whether  or  not
the  third  unidentified  individual  was  to  pay  a  particular
sum of money; however, he was certain that GREER had
arranged for COBB and Senator JACK LINDSEY [sic] to
receive one hundred fifty thousand dollars from ROE and
BRASIER in the event they were able to affect the rollback
of  the  Legislation,  which  was  disguised  as  a  “proviso”
within the Appropriations Bill.

[Taylor's Supp.Memo, 2/10/94, Exh. 7].

It is undisputed that USA Daniel and possibly SA Clemens,
met with Greer and his attorney in Charleston, S.C., sometime
in December of 1990. The defendants made repeated inquiries
concerning  the  existence  of  a  302  or  rough  notes  of  this
meeting.  In  its  memorandum  of  October  18,  1996,  the
government reiterates that no such 302 exists and contends
that  the  circumstances  of  that  meeting  “suggest  that  no
302  would  have  been  done.”  [Gov's.  Post  Hearing  Memo,
10/18/96, p. 35]. What the memorandum does not address,
however,  is  Greer's  testimony  that  he  was  interviewed
“numerous”  or,  at  least,  “several”  times  [Hearing  Tr.,
10/20/95,  Vol.  III,  p.  342].  Although  his  testimony  of  the
precise  number  of  interviews,  the  time  frame  of  each,  and
the place of each interview was never made completely clear,
Greer stated that on at least two occasions subsequent to the
initial meeting he was interrogated extensively by the FBI for
several hours. Id. at pp. 362–6. A 302 of one interview with
Greer in April 1991 dealing exclusively with his drug usage
was furnished the defendants in discovery. If Greer testified
truthfully that at one or more of these interviews he discussed

the capital gains tax issue and his willingness to testify against
Lindsay, then it would appear to the court that at least one 302
should have been prepared in connection with capital gains.

Greer  pled  guilty  to  a  drug  charge  and  was  sentenced  by
this  court  in  July  of  1991.  At  his  sentencing  hearing,  the
government argued for a downward departure from Greer's
sentencing guidelines; and SA Davis, in the presence of USA
Daniel and AUSA Barton, stated to the court:

Your  Honor,  last  Christmas,  the  FBI  approached  Dick
Greer  for  the  first  time  in  connection  with  our  drug
investigation  of  Mr.  Greer.  This  was  prior  to  the  Jack
Rogers indictment. At that time Mr. Greer provided us with
information concerning the capital gains tax investigation.
Mr. Greer essentially told us that Lobbyist Ron Cobb had
approached him and told him that he needed more money to
pay off  *643  both Jack Rogers and Senator Jack Lindsay
in connection with the capital gains tax bill. He told us this
is the first time that he knew that Ron Cobb—that what he
was doing was illegal.

Mr. Greer was willing to testify against Mr. Rogers should
he  have  been  brought  to  trial  and  was  in  fact  scheduled
to testify against Mr. Rogers. Also Mr. Greer was willing
and  scheduled  to  testify  against  Senator  Jack  Lindsay  in
connection with this investigation. I think the investigation
certainly would have resulted in an indictment should Mr.
Lindsay have lived.

[Hearing, 10/18–20/95, Gordon Exh. M, p. 13].

AUSA Barton informed the court at that same hearing:

...  we  were  able  to  bring  the  people
in there and determine that other than
Ron  Cobb,  Jack  Lindsay  and  Jack
Rogers,  there  was  no  illegality  with
any piece of capital gains legislation.
That illegality was only applicable to
the  retroactive  affect  of  capital  gains
and  had  nothing  to  do  with  what
the  governor's  number  one  priority
of  the  Legislature  was,  changing  the
perspective  (sic)  capital  gains  rate.
We find other than, as I described to
you,  Cobb,  Lindsay  and  Rogers,  we
find no corruption, no undue improper

influence,  no  money  changing  hands
with regard to any of the capital gains
bills.

[Id. at p. 11].

During the arguments for a downward departure for Greer,
it  became  apparent  that  this  court  was  poised  to  deny  the
motion, and AUSA Barton requested an in camera hearing to
furnish the court with additional information. It was at this
in  camera  proceeding  that  USA  Daniel  and  AUSA  Barton
presented,  in  some  16  pages  of  transcript  [Id.,  Exh.  L,  pp.
34–49],  the  argument  to  the  court  that  Greer  had  been  of
invaluable  assistance  to  the  government  in  explaining  that
two  capital  gains  tax  bills  were  before  the  Legislature,  a
“retrospective”  or  “rollback”  capital  gains  tax  bill  and  a
“prospective” capital gains tax bill; that Greer had clarified
the difference between the two, and that it was the passage
of  the  “prospective”  bill  in  which  the  Governor  and  his
staff were actively engaged. USA Daniel and AUSA Barton
informed the court that the information given the government
by Randy Lee had been misleading and that it was Greer who
was able to put the government investigation on the proper
course that led the government to close its investigation on
capital gains. In this regard, it is interesting to note that SA
Davis, who, with SA Clemens, was present at the December
1990 meeting, told the OPR investigators that the first time he
and Clemens ever heard this explanation of the “prospective”
bill was at the Greer sentencing. Davis and Clemens were the
two FBI agents most involved in the Lost Trust investigation.

The defendants allege that Greer perjured himself before the
Grand Jury and in the presence of USA Daniel. In the interim
between  the  Christmas  1990  meeting  with  Greer  and  his
sentencing hearing in July 1991, Greer testified on May 23,
1991, before the Grand Jury; and, in response to inquiry from
AUSA Barton, he testified:

Q. Were you aware of any monies paid to any legislators
in [an] effort to influence their vote in connection with the
capital gains rollback bill?

A. No.

Q. How about in connection with the Governor's change,
the bill that was his priority?

A. Absolutely not.

[Id., Exh. K, pp. 14–5].

It is obvious from the government's argument for a downward
departure  for  Greer  that  Greer  had  knowledge  as  early  as
December of 1990 that payoffs had been made by Cobb to
Lindsay  and  Rogers.  USA  Daniel,  who  was  present  at  the
Christmas 1990 meeting, and who was, or should have been,
privy to information given at other debriefings of Greer, was
also present when AUSA Barton questioned Greer before the
Grand Jury. Daniel did nothing to correct Greer's testimony
that  he  was  not  aware  of  any  illegal  payoffs  to  legislators.
AUSA Barton, in his interview with the OPR, provides the
speculation as to why Greer responded as he did to the subject
question before the Grand Jury. He opines that Greer might
have felt justified in a negative response to the wording  *644
“Were you aware ...,” whereas a positive response would have
been forthcoming to the question had it been phrased “Are you
aware....” Greer's later statements in the record would tend to
confirm that suggestion. This play with semantics, however,
appears to the court to be totally without merit.

In  spite  of  the  government's  reliance  at  Greer's  sentencing
on  the  information  given  by  Greer,  no  notes  or  FD–302s
or written memorandums of any kind have surfaced of any
debriefings of Greer with regard to capital gains.

Also,  in  its  in  camera  argument  for  Greer's  downward
departure motion, the government asserts that it was Greer
who provided the names of those persons who could testify
before  the  Grand  Jury  in  support  of  Greer's  version  of  the
capital gains tax bills. The government states in its October
18, 1996, memorandum that “the evidence showed that the
government actively pursued the three identified subjects of
that  investigation  [capital  gains]:  Dick  Greer,  Lindsay  and
Jack Rogers.” [Gov.'s Post–Hearing Memo, 10/18/96, p. 27].
The court disagrees. Greer, himself, was never polygraphed
and no FD–302s or other written memorandums exist. The
government  further  affirmatively  states  that  Greer  did  not
receive  money  in  connection  with  capital  gains  legislation.
[Id.  at  p.  28].  There  is  nothing  is  the  record  to  show  that
the government's “active pursuit” of Greer included a review
of Greer's financial records. It appears that the government
simply accepted Greer's version of events and characterized
the  information  given  by  Randy  Lee  as  “speculative”  and
“misleading.”  Although  at  the  Greer  sentencing  hearing  it
was  indicated  that  the  government  was  “misled”  about  the

capital  gains  matter  by  this  information,  Randy  Lee  was
the  beneficiary  of  a  downward  departure  motion  by  the
government at his sentencing hearing on January 13, 1992,
based  on  his  substantial  assistance  to  the  government.  The
court has difficulty in reconciling the government's position
—that Mr. Greer's “substantial assistance” served to correct
its misconception about the capital gains tax bills and allowed
it  to  put  the  capital  gains  tax  investigation  to  rest—with
its position that Randy Lee provided them with “substantial
assistance,”  when  it  now  claims  Lee  misled  them  into  a
lengthy and expensive investigation. 32

Further,  at  the  sentencing  of  Lost  Trust  defendant  Senator
William Richard Lee on December 3, 1990, the government
requested an in camera hearing for its argument in support of
its downward departure motion. At that time, AUSA Barton
stated:

Your  Honor,  specifically  after  Mr.  Lee  gave  us  those
revelations  about  the  push  that  was  put  on  we  started
looking  at  some  of  the  individuals  who  we  had  some
suspicion  about  and  specifically  I  would  anticipate  the
government seeking an indictment against Representative
Rogers, probably this month, for the acceptance of money
in connection with his vote and work on the capital gains
bill. There is substantial information about Senator Lindsay
as  well  and  his  acceptance  of  money  for  his  vote  and
support in connection with the capital gains bill.

So based on what Mr. Lee gave us and the sort of a kick-off,
if you will, we caught the ball and ran with it and have run
into some pretty good areas that will very definitely result
in charges brought against—I can affirmatively represent
to you against Representative Rogers as a result.

[Hearing, 10/18–20/95, Gordon Exh. J, p. 4].

Senator  Lee  informed  the  court,  in  camera,  through  his
attorney,  that  he  was  present  at  a  meeting  of  Republican
legislators  with  the  Governor  and  his  staff  in  the  spring  or
early summer of 1988 where he was told

to  back  this  bill.  It  is  the  most
important  piece  of  legislation  to  the
governor's  office  for  this  legislative
year.  If  anybody  raises  a  question
about it, you are to sweep it under the

rug. A list was given to him on  *645
how  to  handle  any  tricky  or  difficult
questions, a script.

[Id. at p. 9]

If  the  reference  by  the  Governor's  Office  to  this  “most
important”  legislation  was  a  reference  to  the  “prospective”
capital gains tax bill as described by Mr. Greer, and not to
the  “retroactive”  proviso  in  the  Appropriations  Bill,  which
allegedly would have been extremely beneficial to some of
the  Governor's  friends  and  contributors,  what  would  have
been the need to “sweep under the rug” any tricky questions.

The information provided by Senator Lee is consistent with
the FD–302 of Lobbyist Lee wherein he referred to a meeting
the Governor had with Republican representatives sometimes
after  early  May  1988  in  which  an  “answer  sheet”  was
distributed to the attendees.

A discussion of the capital gains tax investigation would not
be  complete  without  mention  of  a  bizarre  incident  which
came  to  light  during  the  OPR  investigation.  Prior  to  the
OPR investigation, the transcripts of four of the five persons
who  testified  before  the  Grand  Jury  with  regard  to  capital
gains 33  disappeared from a file cabinet at the U.S. Attorney's
Office  and  later  appeared,  unexplained,  in  AUSA  Barton's
desk drawer. This disappearance has never been explained or,
to the court's knowledge, ever been fully investigated.

4. Visit by Cobb and SA Clemens to Home of Steven H.
Smith and Telephone Call to Lindsay.
Subsequent to the drawing of the Blanding/Gordon jury and
prior to the commencement of opening statements, early on
the morning of February 27, 1991, defendants filed a motion
to  dismiss  for  prosecutorial  misconduct  and  requested  an
in camera hearing out of the presence of the government in
order to proffer certain information. The hearing involved the
unredacted copy of a 302 by SA Richards on May 1, 1989,
only  received  by  defendants  Blanding/Gordon  on  February
22, 1991, which defendants alleged substantiated that Cobb
not only committed perjury at the Taylor trial, but that the
government  was  aware  that  he  was  testifying  falsely.  [See
also, § V–2 of this order]. The motion further involved the
defendants  allegation  that  Cobb  committed  perjury  before
the  Grand  Jury  with  regard  to  his  drug  usage,  and  that

20

Williams, Brooke 6/26/2015

information  substantiating  that  charge  only  came  to  light
as  the  result  of  Brady  material  furnished  the  defendants
by  an  order  of  the  court  on  February  14,  1991.  In  setting
out  these  allegations,  Gordon's  attorney  then  addressed  the
information  he  wished  to  proffer  concerning  conversations
he had over the previous two days with defendant Taylor's
attorney. After some discussion about how the information
should be handled, the court called for Taylor's attorney, as
an officer of the court, to appear before the court and make
a  statement.  In  his  statement,  Taylor's  attorney  recounted
how,  through  a  Columbia  attorney,  Dwight  Drake,  he  had
learned that Cobb and an FBI agent had visited the home of a
Steven Harley Smith in the early morning hours just prior to
Taylor's trial. He stated he recognized the impact this incident
could have on the Blanding/Gordon trial and had contacted
Gordon's attorney. He stated that several attempts had been
made to contact Smith, and that he learned through Drake that
Smith was reluctant to get involved. His statement included
the following as having been told to him by Dwight Drake:

And  he  said  that  Mr.  Ron  Cobb  and  an  FBI  agent—
and  he  did  not  name  the  FBI  agent,  but  he  said  an  FBI
agent brought him—that the two of them came by Steve
Smith's house. He said that they—they had a conversation
wherein they acknowledged that Senator John Lindsay of
Bennettsville was very ill and that his wife was restricting
his telephone calls and that it was difficult for just anybody
to call and speak to Senator Lindsay.

And they knew that Steve Smith was a very close friend of
Senator Lindsay, and according to Mr. Drake Steve Smith
was asked by Ron Cobb, or the FBI agent, or  *646  both, to
place a call down to Bennettsville to the Lindsay residence,
and using his friendship, they felt sure he could get through
to Senator Lindsay, that his wife would let him talk, and
apparently that is what did occur.

And according to Dwight, who told me this now, the 25th,
there was a conversation between Mr. Cobb and Senator
Lindsay which he overheard at least one end of. And it had
to do with how he should characterize some money that had
been given by Ron Cobb to Senator Lindsay.

And apparently there was some discussion about whether
that money could be characterized as a legal fee. And at the
end of the conversation, you know, they left.

[In Camera Hearing Tr., 2/27/91, pp. 31–2].

The following day, the hearing continued in camera with the
attorneys for the government present. In addition to testimony
of SA Richards as to the circumstances surrounding his 302
of  May  1,  1989,  and  the  testimony  of  both  Cobb  and  SA
Clemens as to Cobb's drug usage (both issues being addressed
elsewhere in this order), both Cobb and SA Clemens testified
with regard to the visit to the Smith home.

The exchange on direct of Cobb by Gordon reads as follows:

Q.  If  the  monies  that  you  gave  Senator  Lindsay  were
legitimate fees, then why did you have to make a deal that
you wouldn't have to testify against Senator Lindsay? What
had he done wrong, if there were no illegal monies passed
to him.

A. Well, from—from my interpretation of the conversation
with  the  FBI,  they  had  other  things  going  that  I  wasn't
aware of.

Q.  Well,  Mr.  Cobb,  if  you  weren't  aware  of  them  you
couldn't testify about them, could you?

A. That's correct.

Q.  So,  that  couldn't  have  been  the  reason  for  your
agreement with the FBI that you wouldn't have to testify
against Senator Lindsay?

A. Well, obviously, I told—obviously I told them the truth
about the Magnum thing. And from their vantage point that
would be a problem for Senator Lindsay.

Q. So, now, the FBI told you it was a problem for Senator
Lindsay?

A.  No,  they  didn't  tell  me  it  was  a  problem,  this  is  my
own—I say that, I'm thinking this. Remember, this is back
nearly two years ago when—you know, you are refreshing
me through this stuff.

Q. I understand that. I don't have any problem with that.
We will take as long as it takes.

Before you agreed to talk to the FBI about anything, you
told them, “I'm caught, I will cooperate, I will talk to you
about political corruption, but I won't testify against Jack
Lindsay,” did you not?

U.S. v. Taylor, 956 F.Supp. 622 (1997)

A. I won't do anything against Jack Lindsay, that's correct.

Q. And that included testifying?

A. That's correct.

Q. If you had not done or committed any illegal acts with
Jack Lindsay, or if you had no knowledge of Jack Lindsay
participating in any illegal acts, it wasn't necessary for you
to have that agreement with the FBI, was it?

A. My agreement was that I didn't have to testify against
Senator Lindsay. Now, as to anything that he had done—
I know what you are getting at—as far as anything that he
had done, no, I'm not aware of it, but had there been I wasn't
going to be involved in doing anything against the Senator.

....

Q. And how did it come about that you contacted Senator
Lindsay?

A. Because the $10,000 to Magnum was—I was going
to have to testify to that in court. Senator Lindsay was
laying up in the hospital bed dying, and I called. I'm—
I had a very close personal relationship with him, and I
know this is going to hurt him. And I don't want to hurt
him, for this to come out, so I was going to minimize it.

*647  ....

And I couldn't tell him about it, so I got Mike Clemens to,
because I couldn't tell him what I was going to testify to and
I didn't. Mike Clemens told him what was going to come
out, and so it prepared Senator Lindsay for what was going
to come out.

Q. Isn't it a fact, Mr. Cobb, that the reason you called
Senator  Lindsay  was  to  determine  how  you  should
characterize the $10,000 you gave to him?

A. That is absolutely not true.

[Gordon's Motion to Dismiss, 2/22/94, Exh. E, pp. 22–8].
The hearing transcript of February 28, 1991, will show that
SA Clemens testified about that call to Lindsay on direct by
Gordon as follows:

Q. And y'all were discussing the fact that Mr. Cobb would
probably  be  cross-examined  concerning  this  $10,000
payoff  that  he  had  made  to  Representative  Magnum
through Senator Lindsay, correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. And the $10,000 that he gave Senator Lindsay to deliver
the money to Representative Magnum?

A. The monies he had paid Mr. Lindsay, yes.

Q. And during that discussion, Mr. Cobb indicated that he
needed to go call and explain to Senator Lindsay what was
going on, is that how it came about?

A. Pretty much.... He wanted to make sure that Mr. Lindsay
was aware that it was going to come out.

Q. And Mr. Cobb was concerned that Mr. Lindsay, Senator
Lindsay  would  find  out  that  he,  Mr.  Cobb,  had  told  the
government  that  he  had  made  these  different  payoffs  to
Senator Lindsay, correct?

A. He was concerned about that information, yes.

[Id., Exh. D, pp. 24–5].

The record in the Taylor case was supplemented with the in
camera proceedings in the Blanding/Gordon case, and at a
motion hearing to reconsider Taylor's bond pending appeal
held April 11, 1991, the court allowed Taylor to present the
testimony of Steven Smith, who appeared under subpoena. In
his testimony, Smith confirmed that he received a telephone
call and a subsequent visit from Cobb and SA Clemens during
the early morning hours of October 17, 1990. He stated that
“the Senator was not receiving telephone calls from basically
anyone  at  the  time.  However,  due  to  our  friendship  and
closeness he would accept phone calls from me.” He testified
that due to the early morning hour he called the Senator's son
and asked him to have Lindsay call him. In a further recitation
about what transpired that night, Smith testified:

A.  Well,  what  was  occurring  is  this.  Mr.  Cobb  was
insistent upon—and this was the problem which was being
addressed. Mr. Cobb when he arrived was insistent upon
labeling any exchange of money which was to be brought
up in testimony or questions in the case, Mr. Cobb intended

Williams, Brooke 6/26/2015

to call that a legal fee. Whether it was or wasn't I don't know
and was not familiar at the time with what exchanges of
money they were talking about.

Mr. Clemens was insistent to Mr. Cobb that he not label it a
legal fee, but that he—I believe the term to be used was call
it what it was. Now, that can't be quoted, but Mr. Clemens
was trying to move Mr. Cobb away from the legal fee label
to what Mr. Clemens thought to be the truth.

Mr. Cobb was resistant to doing that and was very upset
that he was being asked to do that. It looked like, sounded
like  to  me  when  he  got  there  that  Mr.  Clemens  had
prevailed in his persuasiveness but Mr. Cobb had placed
upon that as a condition or said he would do it if Senator
Lindsay gave him the okay or that he knew that Senator
Lindsay would not be upset with him for doing that. The
purpose of the telephone call was to get Senator Lindsay on
the phone so that Mr. Cobb could talk to him and hopefully
seek that permission so that Ron could be convinced to go
ahead  and  tell  what  Mr.  Clemens  thought  was  based  on
whatever information it was they thought to be the truth.

*648  ....

.... When Ron hung up the phone what he said was he told
me—and I think this is accurate. Again, it is the middle of
the night—something to the effect, “To do what I had to
do.”

....

A. That evening sitting in the breakfast room.... I asked him
I said, “Ron, what is all of this about?”....

He told me then. He said, “I told you, Steve, they had us
jammed up on the oil jobbers bill.”

[Taylor Bond Hearing Tr., 4/11/91, pp. 20–1, 26].

Mr.  Smith  again  testified  under  subpoena  on  October  18,
1995, at a hearing on the instant motions to dismiss:

A. The issue between Mr. Cobb and Mr. Clemens was the
testimony that Mr. Cobb was to give I believe the following
day, if my memory is correct, in a trial, with regard to how
Mr. Cobb would classify monies that were alleged to have
been passed between Mr. Cobb and Senator Lindsay. I don't

know what the monies were or anything, but they called
them monies.

Mr.  Cobb  was  intending  to,  as  related  to  me,  and  Mr.
Clemens  related  that  as  well  at  some  point  during  our
conversation, that Mr. Cobb was going to classify whatever
those monies were as an attorney's fee and that he had been
authorized to do that by the United States Attorney.

[Hearing, 10/18/95, Vol. I, pp. 221–2].

Smith's appearances before this court on these two occasions
were under subpoena and his testimony was consistent. And,
although  Mr.  Smith's  opinion  of  the  events  was  that  SA
Clemens  was  attempting  to  persuade  Cobb  to  tell  the  truth
when he testified, it also indicates that SA Clemens, himself,
was not entirely truthful in his testimony at the hearing on
February  27,  1991,  when  he  described  the  purpose  of  the
visit as one only to give information to Lindsay. Further, it
indicates  that  Cobb  also  was  not  truthful  in  his  testimony
at  the  February  1991  hearing.  The  court  must  agree  with
the defendants' assessment that Lindsay was no stranger to
publicity, and a notice to him that his name might appear in
the media as a result of Cobb's testimony would certainly not
warrant a telephone call to a dying man in the middle of the
night. The involvement of an FBI agent in this entire incident
was—and is—shocking to this court.

Equally shocking is Cobb's testimony during the hearing on
these  motions  on  October  19,  1995.  As  a  result  of  Smith's
testimony  that  there  was  an  argument  between  Cobb  and
SA Clemens as to whether Cobb would “classify whatever
those monies were as an attorney's fee and that he had been
authorized  to  do  that  by  the  United  States  Attorney,”  the
defendants called Cobb as a witness. Taylor on direct queried:

Q. Mr. Cobb, my question to you is, did the United States
Attorney  tell  you  that  you  had  his  permission  to  label
moneys that you had given Mr. Lindsay as legal fees?

A.  I  had  indicated  to  them  that  I  would  call  the  moneys
anything they wanted me to call it, but I won't call it a bribe,
and the terminology legals [sic] fees or contributions came
up, and it was discussed, and I wasn't told not to use it.

Q. Mr. Cobb, didn't you tell us in Mr. Spears' 34  office that
you had a conversation with the U.S. Attorney and that he

U.S. v. Taylor, 956 F.Supp. 622 (1997)

had told you it would be all right for you to call any money
you gave Senator Lindsay a legal fee?

A. Mr. Collins, that was in the course of our conversation,
and as you will recall, we discussed that for a little while
and  I  think  I  relayed  to  you  that  it  was  discussed,  and  I
wasn't told not to, nobody ever said, you know—nobody
ever said, say this, or say that. I implied that I wouldn't say
that it was a bribe, and they indicated that I could call it
something else, and a legal fee was one of those terms.

....

Q. Who told you that, sir?

A. I just told, you several people in the U.S. Attorney's
Office.

Q. Tell me the name of the person who told you that?

A.  It  could  have  been  anybody  in  the  U.S.  Attorney's
Office, Bart Daniel, John Barton, Dale DuTremble.

*649  ....

Q. Who?

Q. .... Mr. Cobb, did Mr. Daniel, former U.S. Attorney, ever
tell you that it was all right with him for you to call any
moneys you gave Senator Lindsay legal fees?

A. Maybe all of the above.

Q. Who?

A.  It's  really  tough  to  answer  that  yes  or  no,  without
explaining—

A.  I  would  leave  it  all  of  the  above  in  the  course  of
conversation.

....

In  course  of  conversations, 

THE  WITNESS: 
the
terminology, legal fees, came up. It was maybe suggested
that  that  would  be  a  possibility,  because  I  was  adamant
about  not  calling  any  moneys  I  gave  Senator  Lindsay
bribes, which I didn't, and don't to this day, but, yes, the
term  legal  fees,  by  the  U.S.  Attorney  was  mentioned  as
something I could call it.
[Hearing Tr., 10/19/95, Vol. II, pp. 24–5].

On cross-examination by the government, the exchange with
Cobb on this subject continued:

Q. Did Bart Daniel ever tell you you could call it legal fees?

A. I have told you that's a very difficult question to say yes.
In course of conversations it came up where I could call it
legal fees, contributions, or what have you.

....

THE WITNESS: Nobody ever programmed me to do that,
but in the course of the conversation, it came up that it could
be called a legal fee, it could be called contributions, but I
wasn't going to call it a bribe.

[Id. at pp. 43–4, 46–7].

Contrary to the government's argument that “the defendants
contend that Cobb had been given permission to call money
he gave to Lindsay ‘legal fees,” [Gov.’ s Post–Hearing Memo,
10/18/96, p. 25], it is Cobb who contends this in his sworn
testimony. In his interview with the DOJ/OPR on September
8,  1994,  USA  Daniel  responded  to  this  allegation:  “I  don't
know why Cobb would say it. It never ever happened.” On
May  26,  1994,  AUSA  Barton  told  the  DOJ/OPR:  “I  recall
nothing  about  someone  coming  up  and  saying  to  me  Hey,
Cobb  asked  if  it  was  ok  to  call  his  payments  to  Lindsay  a
legal fee.” And the notes of a telephone interview of AUSA
DuTremble by the DOJ/OPR on November 10, 1994, show:
“No recollection of Bart D. or any AUSA authorizing Cobb
to call payments to JL ‘legal fees' as recalled by Steve Smith
—Surmises that Cobb may have interpreted USAO's position
on the payments—‘You can call it anything you want to’—
as auth to characterize it as a ‘legal fee’.”

Although there is no sworn testimony in evidence to refute
Cobb's claim, this court is loath to give credence to Cobb's
testimony over the statements of these prosecutors. Although
it does not make a specific finding as to Cobb's truthfulness
in  this  regard,  the  court  has  no  reason  to  dispute  Smith's
testimony that Cobb did, in fact, make the statement.

5. Drug Usage by Cobb.
The defendants have argued extensively about Cobb's drug
usage during the course of this entire matter. First of all, they
complain of the withholding of evidence of his drug usage
in  possession  of  the  government  which  was  not  furnished
to  them,  thus  hampering  their  efforts  to  impeach  Cobb.
Secondly, although they appear to argue that his drug usage
may  have  affected  his  handling  of  the  sting  operation  and
his  testimony,  there  is  no  real  evidence  that  Cobb  was,  in
fact, under the influence of drugs during these times. Thirdly,
they utilize his repeated drug usage to bolster their argument
that the government failed to control the actions   *650  of
a confidential informant in violation of FBI regulations; and,
fourthly, they argue that the government's indictment of Cobb
on two drug violations just prior to the Blanding/Gordon trial
placed Cobb in a position to take the Fifth Amendment and
further hamper their impeachment efforts.

Cobb was first approached by the FBI on April 28, 1989, and
within a day or two became a paid confidential informant. A
formal agreement was not entered into with the government
until October 11, 1989.

On  February  21,  1991,  Cobb  was 
two
misdemeanor drug counts (21 U.S.C. 844(a)), for possession
of cocaine on February 2, 1990, and January 11, 1991. He
pled guilty to both counts on April 10, 1991.

indicted  on 

Cobb's drug usage on the dates of October 13, October 18 and
November 18, 1989, was disclosed at the trials. In addition,
the indictment for possession of cocaine on February 2, 1990,
and January 11, 1991, was returned a few days prior to the
Blanding/Gordon trial, and Cobb was allowed to invoke his
Fifth Amendment rights as to these two incidents during his
testimony  at  that  trial.  Cobb  pled  guilty  to  these  incidents
prior to the Derrick and Long trials. SA Clemens testified that
he admonished Cobb on the three occasions in late 1989 that
his drug usage was not only illegal, but was in violation of
his agreement with the government; however, the government
did not charge him or discontinue his employment.

On July 17, 1990, Cobb testified before the Grand Jury that
he  had  not  used  drugs  since  late  1989.  Count  One  of  the
indictment to which he pled guilty would show his possession
of cocaine in February of 1990; 35  therefore, this testimony,
by Cobb's own admission, is false. In addition, Count Two

of  the  indictment  to  which  he  pled  guilty  would  show  his
possession of cocaine in January of 1991, which is within the
time period between the Taylor trial and the Blanding/Gordon
trial.

The  full  scope  of  Cobb's  drug  usage  was  often  sought  by
the defendants in their quest for discovery materials which
might  impeach  Cobb's  testimony  at  defendants'  trials.  On
November 29, 1993, the defendants received a minimum of
six FBI documents which revealed that Cobb had been under
investigation by the FBI for drug violations since early 1988
[Taylor's Supp.Memo, 2/10/94, Exh. 2], and that he had used
cocaine on at least two other previously unknown occasions
in May of 1989, after he went to work for the FBI [Id., Exh. 3].
Several of these documents indicate that Cobb was reputed to
be a cocaine “trafficker” and implicated others, such as Greer
and Kohn.

In  contrast  to  representations  by  the  government  on  the
record in open court that they had given the defendants each
and  every  tape  they  had  [see  Hearing  Tr.,  4/19/95,  pp.  9–
11],  some  50  audiotapes  and  118  FD–302s,  which  contain
evidence bearing on Cobb's drug usage and trafficking, were
received by defendants in February of 1995 [Taylor's Second
Supp.Memo, 8/25/95, pp. 21–2].

It is now evident that Cobb had the reputation of a cocaine
user and/or dealer and that this was known to the government
prior to their employment of him in the sting. It is also evident
that  he  purchased  and/or  used  cocaine  at  least  periodically
during  the  time  he  was  employed  in  the  sting  through  the
times  he  testified  at  the  Taylor  trial  and  at  the  Blanding/
Gordon trial.

In  his  testimony  regarding  his  drug  usage,  Cobb  gave  as
reasons for the drug usage on which he was questioned as the
need to protect his cover and, for one occasion, the emotional
effect of the death of Lindsay. Cobb also claimed that the drug
deal for which he was initially approached was done solely
for  the  purpose  of  getting  funds  to  pay  his  wife's  medical
bills.  Just  prior  to  his  trial,  Taylor  offered  to  the  court  an
affidavit by Cobb's wife, which was placed under seal, where
she affirmatively stated that Cobb did not, in fact, contribute
to the payment of her medical bills.

*651   All  of  the  defendants,  possibly  more  so  Taylor,
Blanding  and  Gordon,  were  unable  to  impeach  Cobb's

testimony  and  confront  him  with  the  fact  that  he  had  been
involved in drugs on more occasions and over a longer period
of time than disclosed, and that his involvement in drugs was
so deep that he had earned the reputation of a “trafficker.”
This information was, of course, known to the government
since at least February of 1988.

A. Yes, ma'am, I did.

Q. Was it on your house?

A. Yes, ma'am, my home.

6. Evidence re Kohn.
Kohn's  involvement  in  the  extensive  use  of  cocaine  and
alcohol was admitted by him during the trials. On December
6,  1989,  Cobb,  as  a  government  informant,  participated  in
the videotaping of an occasion on which he purchased $500–
worth of cocaine from Kohn. Kohn is then shown on the tape
using  cocaine.  This  tape  (#  7)  was  not  turned  over  to  the
defendants until sometime around the Derrick trial; however,
Taylor concedes that he received a letter from the government
very shortly before trial telling him that the government had
evidence of Kohn giving cocaine to Cobb. He argues that he
was deeply involved in preparing for trial; and, that since this
is all that he was told, he did not take the time to pursue it.
He indicates that had the government disclosed to him that
a sale was recorded on video tape, and had he been told of
the large amount of the purchase or that the tape showed the
actual use of the cocaine by Kohn, he would have recognized
its significance. Taylor contends that the jury's assessment of
Kohn's credibility could well have been impacted by actually
viewing Kohn “snorting” cocaine.

Although  it  is  the  government's  responsibility  to  disclose
evidence  to  the  defendants  in  a  timely  and  honest  manner,
it  is  also  the  responsibility  of  the  defense  to  review  that
evidence when it is disclosed. The reference by the court to
this particular issue, therefore, is not to excuse Taylor's failure
to review the tape, but simply to show the cumulative effect
on the defense of potentially impeachable material not being
fully or timely disclosed.

The defendants argue that during the Taylor trial, in response
to Taylor's effort to impeach Kohn, the government misled
the  court  as  to  the  relevancy  of  the  issue  of  a  personal
insurance settlement by Kohn following Hurricane Hugo. The
government objected on relevancy grounds when the defense
attempted to cross-examine Kohn as follows:

Q. Did you have an insurance claim personally?

Q. How much did you receive for that? Was it $100,000?

A. No it was not.

Mr. Daniel: Your Honor, I object as to the relevance.

The Court: It doesn't sound too relevant, Mrs. Courie. 36

[Taylor  Trial  Tr.,  Vol.  IV,  p.  141].  What  the  government
knew,  but  was  unknown  to  the  defendant  Taylor  and  the
subsequent  trial  defendants,  was  that  there  existed  a  tape
(Tape # 98), made on April 26, 1990, of a discussion between
Cobb and Kohn which would have gone directly to Kohn's
credibility. Cobb inquires about Kohn's weekend plans and
the conversation continues:

Kohn: Ah, I'm not sure. I got a—It ain't nothing exciting,
just  try  to  get  caught  up  on  a  couple  (unintelligible)  in
Charleston and get all my stuff together for my financial
insurance settlement.

Cobb: Mm, hmm.

Kohn: Now that was the greatest scam I've ever pulled off.
Turned a $500 claim into a $100,000 settlement.

Cobb: Wow. That would be your hit for the year.

Kohn: Mm, hmm.

Cobb: A nice one.

Kohn: Insurance is (unintelligible) I, set this company up.
I mean I set the insurance company so there is nothing they
can do on it.

Cobb: Huh?

Kohn: Set them up the whole way through and, uh, said
well I need to bring my dad  *652  into contract. He says
you don't need to bring anything. See I don't understand
the instructions. I don't understand. He said all we're gonna
talk about is how much money they're gonna give you. You
see, the, the high, the lowest figure they're talking about

borders in my range. (Unintelligible). I think I got them on
unfair claims. (Unintelligible).

[Audiotape # 98, 4/26/90].

The defendants refer to this tape as “devastating” evidence,
which was not furnished to them until after this court's order
of  November  9,  1994.  As  well  as  being  evidence  material
to the impeachment of Kohn, the first part of this same tape
records a meeting concerning the pari-mutuel bill. The tape
is unintelligible for the most part in this regard; however, it
is significant that the cover sheet (FD–302) specifically lists
Taylor as one of the speakers. It is impossible, therefore, for
the court to understand how the government could consider
this particular tape “irrelevant.”

It is well established that the government must often take its
witnesses as it finds them. Yet in this case, Kohn was not only
employed by the government as a confidential informant after
he was approached by the FBI in May of 1990, but he was
used to assist Cobb in actively soliciting fellow legislators and
became a significant player in the sting operation.

7. Control of “Sting” Operation by Cobb.
Another of the defendants' allegations is that the government
lost  control  over  Cobb,  its  primary  undercover  informant.
The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals has referred to Cobb as
the “cornerstone” of the government's case. The defendants
allege that under the regulations governing this sting, Cobb
was forbidden to go out looking for people to bribe—this was
to be strictly an “open door” operation. Yet we see that Cobb
on occasion chose the legislators he wished to approach. 37
He was admonished that he could not use drugs during the
course of the investigation, yet he repeatedly did so. It was
Cobb  who  arranged  the  meetings  with  the  defendants  and
notified the FBI when to turn on the video cameras. Cobb also
convinced  SA  Clemens  to  participate  with  him  in  the  very
questionable 2:00 a.m. visit to Steve Smith's house and the
telephone call to Lindsay.

The government originally paid Cobb $2,000 per month and
later  raised  the  amount  to  $4,000  per  month.  It  is  part  of
the record that these payments continued through the original
trials, but it is unknown to the court whether these monthly
payments are still being made. In addition, the government
returned to him the $20,000 cash payment Cobb had made

to  an  undercover  agent  in  the  cocaine  investment  deal  that
precipitated his involvement in Lost Trust. A $150,000 bonus
for Cobb has been approved by the government; however, the
last mention of this that the court can find in the record is that
the payment was put on hold, and whether this bonus has ever
been paid to Cobb is unknown to the court. If not, this bonus
takes on some significance should he be required to testify in
any retrials.

The  court  is  of  the  opinion  that  Cobb  maneuvered  himself
into the “driver's seat” position, and the government was a
hostage  to  him.  It  is  apparent  that  the  government  knew  it
had  to  “court”  Cobb  in  order  for  him  to  work  with  them
effectively. At times, he literally took over the investigation
and  directed  its  course.  From  its  actions,  it  would  *653
appear  the  government  was  afraid  Cobb  would  pull  out
of  the  investigation  and  ruin  their  cases.  According  to  a
statement SA Clemens made to the OPR, Cobb flatly told the
government from the very beginning that he would not testify
against  Lindsay  and  they  could  just  take  him  to  jail.  Thus,
Cobb forced the government on several important occasions
into conduct not acceptable to the court.

8. Government “Targets” in Violation of “Sting”
Guidelines.
The  portion  of  Cobb's  manuscript  cited  above  to  show  the
control Cobb had over the investigation has also been cited
by the defendants to show that Cobb was encouraged to use
the sting operation to pursue individuals already targeted by
the  FBI  in  violation  of  FBI  regulations  and  that  selective
prosecution was also an issue.

In a teletype from the Director of the FBI to FBI–Columbia,
receive-stamped “ ‘89 NOV–1” [Taylor's Third Supp.Memo,
3/28/96,  Exh.  4],  in  which  the  Columbia  office  is  notified
that  the  use  of  the  pari-mutuel  bill  in  this  investigation
is  approved,  the  Columbia  office  is  cautioned:  “Columbia
should  ensure  that  this  scenario  is  executed  pursuant  to
investigative plan outlined in UCO Proposal, i.e., a passive
approach  through  contacts  with  predicated  lobbyists.”  The
defendants contend that this investigation was anything but
passive.

At  a  hearing  on  April  19,  1995,  Gordon  published  several
pages  from  the  Cobb  manuscript,  The  Second  Burning  of
Columbia. 38

COBB:  B.J.  Gordon,  they  had  files  on  him;  they  had

D: Because they just didn't have the evidence?

COBB: He had been to court two or three times. They
had charged him two or three times. But he could always
beat them. But he didn't outrun this boy.

D: And yet the FBI was okay with that? I mean the FBI—

COBB: They wanted him bad, bad.

[Hearing Tr., 4/19/95, p. 24].

He then continues to publish:

D: Did you, the pari-mutuel, put on the table as the idea?
My  experience  in  Alabama  is  that  pari-mutuel  betting  is
a black issue. And you had to know when you put pari-
mutuel  betting  on  the  table  that  you're  going  to  have  a
skewed number of blacks. Did you know that? Did the FBI
know that?

COBB: Sure they knew it. I knew it. Hell, if I knew it I
know they did. But we didn't discuss about the numbers. I'd
talk a lot of times, I would make the comment a lot of times
that I could have the whole black caucus. There would be
no more damn niggers. It was kind of funny to them for a
while until we got half of them and they said, pull in the
reins,  but  believe  me,  we  could  have  had  most  of  them.
Because you throw out some dollars and the mother f's first
are going to be knocking the doors down. They were easy.
Even B.J. as much trouble as they had with him. Shit I got
him. The way I got him, f, you don't get away from it.

[Id. at pp. 24–5].

The above statements by Cobb would certainly indicate that
the investigation went far outside the guidelines set forth for
this sting.

9. The Report by the OPR
As hereinbefore mentioned, following the filing of the Taylor
and  Gordon  motions  to  dismiss,  USA  J.  Preston  Strom,
in  February  1994,  requested  the  Office  of  Professional
Responsibility  of  the  Department  of  Justice  (DOJ/OPR)

to  investigate  the  allegations  of  prosecutorial  misconduct
raised  by  the  defendants'  motions.  This  procedure  was
unusual  in  that  such  investigations  generally  are  not
conducted  by  the  OPR  until  after  a  judicial  finding  of
misconduct.

The  OPR  “bifurcated”  the  investigation,  requesting  the
FBI/OPR  to  investigate  the  *654   allegations  against  SA
Clemens. The DOJ/OPR then proceeded to address “only the
USAO's  failure  to  provide  the  two  302s  complained  of  in
both  motions,  those  appearing  to  be  the  documents  which
raise the most serious misconduct issues.” [Hearing, 4/19/95,
Defs.  Exh.  30,  p.  10,  ftn.  15].  These  are  the  302s  dated
June  22,  1989  and  September  25,  1989  (the  “secret”  302),
which were not received by the defendants until November
1993. Both of these 302s dealt with Cobb's characterization
of  the  cash  payments  he  made  to  the  defendants.  Taylor's
motion  also  included  arguments  of  intentional  wrongdoing
in the government's failure to produce numerous additional
documents,  but  the  investigation  did  not  address  these.  On
December  6,  1994,  the  FBI/OPR  reported  its  findings  to
the DOJ/OPR [Id., Exh. 45], and the DOJ/OPR amended its
report  to  include  these  findings  on  February  16,  1995  [Id.,
Exh. 44]. The October 18th report concludes that, although

..., 

mistakes 

“incremental 
and
misjudgments were made by the FBI
and  prosecutors  alike 
in  our
view,  it  is  more  plausible  that  these
incremental  failings  rather  than  any
intentional  and  wrongful  decision  to
conceal  led  to  the  failure  in  the  first
two  Lost  Trust  cases  to  provide  the
defense  with  the  302s  dated  June  22
and September 25, 1989.”

[Id., Exh. 30, p. 22].

The amended report of February 16, 1994, made a finding that
sanctions against SA Clemens were warranted as a result of
the following infractions:

review  all  of  his  interview  reports
to  properly  prepare  for  testimony;
unintentional misrepresentation in trial
testimony; failure to properly maintain
investigative notes in accordance with
Bureau rules and regulations; failure to
inform either the USAO or the Bureau
upon discovery of the interview notes
and his subsequent neglect of duty to
report  such  an  action  as  required  in
light  of  the  controversy  surrounding
his  testimony;  and  failure  to  advise
OPR of the interview notes.

[Id.,  Exh.  44,  p.  13].  The  sanctions  imposed  have  been
previously cited in this order.

During  its  investigation,  the  OPR  conducted  numerous
interviews,  the  notes  of  which,  by  order  of  the  court,
were  furnished  to  the  court  and  the  defendants.  The
defendants have vigorously contested the limited scope of the
investigation  and  the  report.  They  question  the  decision  to
focus on only two 302s in light of their numerous allegations;
they contend that numerous interviews were not incorporated
into the report, and that the report does not accurately reflect
the results of the interviews conducted. The court must agree
in  that  there  is  an  obvious  omission  of  any  consideration
of  the  statement  given  to  the  OPR  by  SA  Dick  that  it  was
clear to him that the monies Cobb paid to Lindsay were in
violation of the Hobbs Act even though Cobb would never
allow these transactions to be characterized as bribes—and
that this was discussed many times among SA Clemens, the
USAO and himself. SA Dick, as the supervisor of the White
Collar Crime section of the Criminal Division, was thus the
supervisor of the Lost Trust investigation. His statement that
these  discussions  frequently  occurred  do  not  appear  to  be
taken into consideration by the FBI/OPR in its determination
as to Clemens alleged perjury on February 28, 1991.

At the time the DOJ/OPR and FBI/OPR investigations took
place,  only  the  motions  of  defendants  Taylor  and  Gordon
were  under  consideration;  joinder  by  defendants  Blanding,
Derrick and Long in these motions and the filing of Derrick's
dismissal motion came later. Further, the motions of Taylor
and  Gordon  address  issues  based  on  additional  discovery
received in November of 1993. Subsequently, the government
was ordered by several court orders to furnish other materials,

which  have  led  to  additional  allegations  of  misconduct  not
addressed by the OPR.

The court has carefully reviewed all of the interview notes.
Although it will not make a definitive finding of misconduct
by  the  OPR,  it  does  appear  that  many  questions  were  left
either uninvestigated and/or unanswered.  *655  Some of the
pending allegations arose from additional discovery now in
the hands of the defendants that was not before the OPR. The
government continues to rely heavily on the findings of the
OPR; this court does not share in that view. Therefore, it is
only  in  a  limited  context  that  the  court  has  considered  the
OPR's conclusions.

The OPR report did reveal that the government rushed into
the Taylor trial before it was prepared to go to court. AUSA
DuTremble has cited “pressure by the Governor” [Hearing,
10/18–20/95, Gordon Exh. P] as a reason for the government's
haste. Other prosecutors indicated that it was important to the
government to convict Taylor early on in the hope that other
defendants would plead guilty as a result. It is also reflected
in  the  report  that  during  the  investigation  and  preparation
for trial there was utter confusion as to discovery and some
dissention in the ranks both at the FBI and the AUSO, and that
no real guidance was provided by the FBI to SA Clemens, a
first-office agent.

In  addition,  in  light  of  the  pending  trial  status  of  these
defendants, they object on the grounds of prejudicial pretrial
publicity to a press conference held by FBI Director Louis
Freeh on a visit to Columbia, South Carolina, following the
issuance of the OPR report, in which he announced that the
government had been cleared of all misconduct allegations.
This  press  conference  by  Director  Freeh  presents  a  serious
problem  for  the  court.  The  lofty  respect  inherent  in  his
position in the minds of the public is probably unparalleled.
The  legal  position  of  these  defendants  at  this  time  is  that
they  are  under  indictment  pending  trial.  Although  some  of
the  evidence  before  this  court  in  its  consideration  of  the
motions  to  dismiss  for  prosecutorial  misconduct  may  not
be admissible at trial under the Federal Rules of Evidence,
certainly much of it would be. A pretrial public statement by
the FBI Director that this evidence has already been found to
be without merit is appalling to this court.

U.S. v. Taylor, 956 F.Supp. 622 (1997)

This  court  has  found  that  the  government  continued  to
incrementally  provide  evidence  relative  to  these  motions
even after recusal of the USAO for South Carolina and the
appointment of attorneys from the Public Integrity Section of
the DOJ in Washington. A review of the record will show that,
following a status conference on October 20, 1994, the court
in a written order filed November 9, 1994,

ORDERED,  that  the  United  States
make  available  to  the  within-named
defendants, their attorneys and agents,
no  later  than  December  1,  1994,
all  audiotapes  and  videotapes  and
all  reports  of  interviews  (FBI  FD–
302s) and agents' rough notes pertinent
thereto resulting from the “Operation
Lost Trust” investigation.

[Order, 11/9/94, p. 2].

Some ten protective orders and orders ruling on requested in
camera  review  were  then  filed  by  the  court.  On  March  15
and 17, 1995, defendants Taylor and Gordon filed discovery
motions relative to the motions to dismiss, which were heard
on April 19, 1995. On April 20, 1995, the court

ORDERED,  that  all  documents  and/
or  materials  in  possession  of  the
government  dealing  with  these  cases
and  not  presently  available  to  the
defendants in the “evidence room” be
produced  by  the  government  direct
to  the  court  at  Charleston,  South
Carolina, not later than Monday, May
8,  1995,  for  in  camera  inspection

the  court. 

....  All 

[Order, 4/19/95, p. 3].

Twelve  boxes  of  documents  were  submitted  by 
the
government to the court for in camera review, and a detailed
21–page  discovery  order  was  filed  as  to  the  disposition  of
the materials therein on July 25, 1995. In this order the court
notes:

Defendants argue that the pattern and practice of behavior
by  the  government  has  instilled  in  them  a  deep  sense
of  mistrust  and  that  a  full  in  camera  inspection  of  all
materials in possession of the government was warranted.
The government, although acknowledging the existence of
an  “open  file”  policy,  has  continued  to  argue  *656   as
to  what  is  and  is  not  discoverable  pursuant  to  Brady  v.
Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194 [10 L.Ed.2d 215]
(1963).  In  response  to  defendants'  argument  that  the  65
audio  tapes  furnished  in  March  1995  should  have  been
furnished with discovery materials for the original trials,
the  government  claims  that  they  dealt  exclusively  with
drugs;  that  they  were  not  turned  over  because  they  had
not  been  and  would  not  be  used  at  trial,  and,  therefore,
they were not relevant and not discoverable under Brady.
The court finds the government's argument in this regard
ludicrous.  The  record  in  these  cases  is  clear  that  the
drug investigation was hand-in-glove with the corruption
investigation known as Lost Trust. Ten of the twenty-eight
defendants  pled  to  drug  charges.  Although  the  purpose
of  this  order  is  not  to  address  the  motions  to  dismiss,
government arguments such as this cause the court to look
very closely at what was withheld by the government that
may have jeopardized the rights of these defendants.

There  also  has  been  much  discussion  throughout  these
cases of the impact of an investigation by the government
into federal violations in the handling of legislation known
as  the  capital  gains  tax  bill  that  had  come  before  the
South  Carolina  Legislature.  The  defendants  claim  there
was a cover-up by the government and that they were not
furnished the discovery needed to pursue the calling and/or
impeachment of witnesses. The government acknowledges
the  investigation  but  states  emphatically  that  it  found
this  to  be  a  non-issue  and  not  relevant  to  the  trials  of
these  defendants.  Again,  the  court  does  not  wish  at  this
time to make a finding on the merits of either argument;
however, inasmuch as one of the key figures in the Lost
Trust  investigation  pled  to  a  RICO  violation,  one  of  the
predicate offenses of which was the taking of a bribe from
the government's cooperating subject and key Lost Trust
witness, Ron Cobb, in relation to the capital gains tax bill,
the government cannot now claim that its investigation into
improprieties  relevant  to  the  capital  gains  tax  legislation
was  irrelevant  to  these  cases.  The  court,  therefore,  can
understand the defendants' arguments of mistrust.

For Educational Use Only

U.S. v. Taylor, 956 F.Supp. 622 (1997)

[Order, 7/25/95, pp. 6–8].

This order also set forth a schedule for the filing of additional
memorandums and set an evidentiary hearing on the subject
motions for October 18, 1995. In the interim, the government
furnished  additional  materials  for  in  camera  inspection  on
two separate occasions, and the court issued its rulings with
regard to these materials on September 7 and October 6, 1995.

The  October  6th  order  addresses  a  file  received  by  the
court  which  included  “copies  of  the  materials  [obviously
discoverable FD–302s and agents' rough notes],” and further
states in pertinent part:

It  is  unnecessary  for  the  court  to
reiterate  here  the  lengthy  history  of
discovery  problems  in  these  cases.
Suffice  it  to  say  that  the  materials
furnished to the defendants and to the
court on October 4, 1995, should have
been furnished long ago.

[Order, 10/6/95, p. 2].

The  first  hearing  on  the  motions  to  dismiss  had  been  set
for  October  18,  1995,  since  the  previous  July.  Yet  here,
just  short  of  a  year  after  the  court's  order  establishing  the
evidence  room  and  just  two  weeks  prior  to  a  hearing  of
the motions, the government was still turning over relevant
evidence to these defendants. In addition, during the October
1995 hearing the existence of several FBI “CW” (Cooperating
Witness)  files  came  to  light.  One  of  the  files  contained  an
FD–302 not previously furnished to defendants. Defendants
also  moved  for  this  court  to  reconsider  portions  of  its  July
25,  1995  order,  and  the  court  agreed  to  an  in  camera
inspection  of  the  CW  files  and  several  of  the  boxes  of
materials denied to defendants on July 25th. At the October
hearing,  the  defendants  also  requested  and  received  from
the  FBI  computer-generated  printouts  of  the  inventories  of
the FBI's entire “Lost Trust” and “Capital Gains” files. On
January 19, 1996, defendant Taylor moved the court to direct
the  government  to  provide  access  to  all  of  the  documents
identified thereon. The court's order of February 6, 1996, as
amended February 23, 1996, resulted.

*657   The  court's  frustration  at  this  point  is  evident  in  its
February 6th order, which states in part:

It is well past time for discovery to be completed. Although
the court in no way wishes to jeopardize the investigative
methods  of  the  federal  government,  it  is  clear  from  a
review of the records now before it that little, if anything,
contained  therein  can  still  be  classified  as  “sensitive.”
Additionally, all of the materials furnished are subject to
protective orders restricting the use and dissemination of
these  materials.  The  court  has  previously  opined  that  a
wider  latitude  must  be  given  with  regard  to  materials  to
be  furnished  for  the  purposes  of  the  defendants'  pursuit
of their motions to dismiss for prosecutorial misconduct
than  might  be  given  for  trial  preparation.  The  alleged
misconduct  of  government  attorneys  and  agents  during
the  preparation  and  trials  of  these  cases  is  the  basis  for
the  defendants'  motions,  and  defendants'  argument  that
they are entitled to a thorough review of the government's
records  is  not  without  merit,  particularly  in  light  of  the
discovery history in these matters.

....

... although there may be some justification for the delay
in furnishing some materials to the defendants as ordered
by  the  court,  the  volume  of  the  materials  which  have
surfaced just over the past few months and their possible
significance to the defendants is of concern to the court.
[Order, 2/6/96, pp. 7–8].

In its Post–Hearing Memorandum, the government attempts
to explain why certain files were not submitted to the court
as  and  when  ordered.  As  shown  above,  the  court  ordered
the  government  to  make  available  to  the  defendants  all
documents  known  by  the  government  to  be  of  a  nature  to
be used by defendants to impeach witnesses or support the
defendants' theories of their defenses. These cases were and
are being prosecuted by various government attorneys, and
for various reasons they have withheld documents that would
have  been  of  assistance  to  the  defendants  in  defending  the
charges  against  them.  The  government  now  concedes  that
numerous mistakes were made in furnishing discovery and
the DOJ/OPR in its report found that

and  prosecutors  alike  and,  in  our
view,  it  is  more  plausible  that  these
incremental  failings  rather  than  any
intentional and wrongful decisions to
conceal  led  to  the  failure  in  the  first
two  Lost  Trust  cases  to  provide  the
defense with the 302s [required].

[Gov's Post–Hearing Memo, 10/18/96, p. 6]. The court cannot
agree with this finding because the failings of the government
to  provide  meaningful  discovery  were  so  numerous  that
it  would  be  disingenuous  to  say  that  these  mistakes  were
incremental  failings  rather  than  intentional  or  wrongful
decisions. In fact, these failings, spanned over the time from
the  beginning  of  these  cases  until  just  several  months  ago,
amount to a pattern of conduct.

In  undisputed  testimony  on  October  3,  1996  [Hearing  Tr.,
10/3/96, p. 182], the court was informed that prior to his trial
Taylor received only 66 of the 550–plus–or–minus 302s and
26 of the 227–plus–or–minus tapes that are now in defendants'
possession. The number of 302s and tapes received pretrial
by the other defendants would vary only slightly.

VI. THE COURT'S SUPERVISORY POWER

In  the  case  of  United  States  v.  Banks,  383  F.Supp.  389
(D.S.D.1974),  appeal  dismissed,  United  States  v.  Means,
513 F.2d 1329 (8th Cir.1975), that court, in a Memorandum
Decision  treating  defendants'  motion  for  acquittal  as  a
motion  to  dismiss  for  government  misconduct,  dismissed
with prejudice the charges against the defendants by the use
of its supervisory power. The Banks court, citing to McNabb
v. United States, 318 U.S. 332, 63 S.Ct. 608, 87 L.Ed. 819
(1943),  decided  that  the  court's  supervisory  power  can  be
utilized whenever the administration of justice is tainted, and,
indeed,  it  is  the  court's  duty  to  “[establish]  and  [maintain]
civilized standards of procedure and evidence.” [Id. at 340,
63 S.Ct. at 613]. Some of the circuits  *658  have found that
demonstrable prejudice must exist in order for the court to
exercise its supervisory power; however, the court in Banks
found  that  it  need  not  address  whether  due  process  was
offended when the facts showed such aggravated conduct as
to warrant dismissal. In the Fourth Circuit case, United States
v. Omni Intern. Corp., 634 F.Supp. 1414 (D.Md.1986), Judge
Black discusses the requirement of prejudice and concludes

that “[a] common thread underlying many decisions is that
the  magnitude  of  the  misconduct  affects  the  use  of  the
supervisory power, whether or not actual prejudice is shown.”
Id. at 1438. See, e.g., United States v. Serubo, 604 F.2d 807,
818  (3d  Cir.1979)  (prosecutorial  conduct  extreme);  United
States  v.  Hogan,  712  F.2d  757  (2d  Cir.1983)  (misconduct
flagrant);  United  States  v.  Fischbach  &  Moore,  Inc.,  576
F.Supp.  1384,  1396  (W.D.Pa.1983)  (isolated  incident  of
misconduct).

  This  court  has  weighed  the  seriousness  of  the

  [3]

[2]
misconduct  against  the  available  remedies,  and  finds  that,
as  in  the  Banks  and  Omni  cases,  the  misconduct  here
is  repetitious,  flagrant  and  longstanding.  See  Banks,  383
F.Supp. at 392; Omni, 634 F.Supp. at 1438; United States v.
Hogan, 712 F.2d at 761; United States v. Lawson, 502 F.Supp.
158,  172  (D.Md.1980).  I  also  find  that  the  government's
misconduct “need not be so unfair or imprudent as to offend
‘due  process'  before  exercise  of  this  [court's]  supervisory
power  is  appropriate.”  McNabb,  318  U.S.  at  340,  63  S.Ct.
at  613.  Although  this  court  is  of  the  opinion  that  the  sixth
amendment  right  to  a  fair  trial  guaranteed  to  each  of  these
defendants has been jeopardized because of the government's
actions  throughout  these  proceedings,  the  Constitutional
issues raised by the instant motions need not be addressed.

The  court  is  convinced  that  this  investigation  began  in  an
appropriate fashion. It is, after all, the responsibility of the
FBI  and  the  USAO  to  pursue  information  with  regard  to
illegal  acts  within  their  jurisdiction.  It  is  the  opinion  of
the court, however, that some of the investigators and lead
prosecutors got lost on their way to the lofty goal of weeding
out  drugs  and  corruption  from  the  South  Carolina  State
House. Overzealousness and political pressure upon those in
positions  of  authority  appear  to  be  the  detours  that  led  the
government to rush to trial, especially in the cases of Taylor,
Blanding  and  Gordon;  to  withhold  volumes  of  exculpatory
evidence;  to  allow  perjured  testimony  to  stand  uncorrected
on more than one occasion; to allow its primary cooperating
witness, Cobb, to take an unusual amount of control of the
sting operation; to go outside of its own regulations to target
certain legislators, and to mislead this court to such an extent
as to perpetrate a fraud upon the court.

While lawyers representing private parties may—indeed,
must—do everything ethically permissible to advance their
clients' interests, lawyers representing the government in

criminal cases serve truth and justice first. The prosecutor's
job isn't just to win, but to win fairly, staying well within
the  rules.  [Citations  omitted].  As  Justice  Douglas  once
warned, “[t]he function of the prosecutor under the Federal
Constitution  is  not  to  tack  as  many  skins  of  victims  as
possible to the wall. His function is to vindicate the right
of people as expressed in the laws and give those accused
of crime a fair trial.” Donnelly v. DeChristoforo, 416 U.S.
637, 648–49, 94 S.Ct. 1868, 1874, 40 L.Ed.2d 431 (1974)
(Douglas, J., dissenting).

U.S. v. Kojayan, 8 F.3d 1315, 1323 (9th Cir.1993).

Almost  without  exception,  the  lead  prosecutors  in  these
cases  had  practiced  before  this  court  many  times,  and  the
“open  file”  policy  of  this  district  and  this  court  had  never
before  come  into  question.  USA  Daniel  was  an  Assistant
U.S. Attorney in Charleston for several years and prosecuted
high-profile,  multi-defendant  cases  before  this  court.  The
“open  file”  policy  was  never  disputed  during  those  trials,
and Daniel was totally familiar with it. As the United States
Attorney  guiding  the  prosecution  of  the  within  cases,  it
was his responsibility to oversee the handling of discovery.
The  withholding  of  such  a  voluminous  array  of  discovery
which  the  government  had  to  know  was  exculpatory  and
relevant to the defenses of these defendants is unprecedented
before this court. The court  *659  finds that these violations
are  too  numerous  and  too  specific  to  certain  issues  to  be
considered  simply  unintentional  or  the  result  of  neglect.
For example, it is unfathomable that the government could
have  possibly  considered  the  drug  investigation  of  Cobb
prior to his employment as a confidential informant, or the
investigation of Cobb, Lindsay and Greer in the capital gains
tax investigation, as anything but relevant.

Even  more  offensive  to  the  court  are  the  continual
misrepresentations  made  to  the  court  that  all  discovery  to
which  the  defendants  were  entitled  had  been  turned  over
to  them.  The  government  had  to  have  been  aware  of  so
much  information  that  incriminated  public  figures  holding
powerful  positions,  yet  it  did  not  submit  to  the  court  for
review the discovery it claimed would jeopardize on-going
investigations or that it claimed to be irrelevant. The constant
assurances that “we have given them everything,” the veracity
of which the court had no reason at that time to question, rises
to  the  level  of  outrageous  conduct.  It  would  be  impossible

to  cite  to  each  instance  where  this  type  of  assurance  was
repeated.

It  appears  that  in  these  cases,  much  of  the  government's
misconduct  actually  stems  from  its  failure  to  disclose
evidence  to  the  defendants.  In  the  case  of  United  States  v.
DeMarco, 407 F.Supp. 107 (C.D.Cal.1975), the withholding
of  exculpatory  evidence  alone  was  sufficient  to  grant  a
dismissal of the indictment, albeit without prejudice.

“His  [the  prosecutor's]  duty  is  to
provide  exculpatory  evidence  to  the
defense  and  then  seek  to  rebut  it
before  the  trier  of  fact.  It  is  not
the  prosecutor's  function  to  structure
a  proceeding  in  such  a  way  that
exculpatory material is concealed from
the defense, the court, and the jury.”

Id. at 112.

In addition, the court finds that the government, during the
period  following  remand  of  these  cases  and  in  connection
with  the  instant  motions,  continued  its  course  of  action
with  regard  to  the  disclosure  of  evidence,  in  violation  of
court  orders.  Its  attitude  concerning  discovery  continued
well  into  1996,  even  after  the  court  admonished  it  that  the
determination  of  relevancy  of  the  materials  relating  to  the
motions to dismiss was within the jurisdiction of the court and
not the government.

The  court  is  of  the  opinion  that  an  investigation  and
subsequent prosecution of what might have started out with
the altruistic motive of ridding the State Legislature of drugs
and  political  corruption  became  a  political  bombshell  that
backfired. The entire Lost Trust matter was a political “coup”
as  well  as  a  political  “hot  potato”  for  the  United  States
Attorney's Office. USA Daniel called a press conference to
announce the initial indictments. The defendants had claimed
that  this  press  conference  constituted  prejudicial  pretrial
publicity and they now question whether authority for it was
even given USA Daniel, as required, by the Department of
Justice. No substantial evidence one way or the other on the
question of authority was ever offered, nor does the court find
that the defendants have offered any additional testimony to
meet the burden of proving that they were directly prejudiced
by this press conference. 39

U.S. v. Taylor, 956 F.Supp. 622 (1997)

This  press  conference  did  create,  however,  an  atmosphere
of public expectation from which the government could not
retreat,  even  when  the  investigation  led  to  roads  it  did  not
want to travel. When they chose Cobb as the focal point of the
sting, they had to carry all the baggage he brought with him
—his drug use, his refusal to involve Lindsay, his apparent
inability to be totally truthful, and his unwillingness to follow
instructions. The government lost control of its star witness,
both during the sting operation and during his testimony at
the  trials.  This  allowed  Cobb  to  choose  the  legislators  he
wished  to  *660   solicit,  specifically,  Derrick,  Gordon  and
members  of  the  Black  Caucus—for  whatever  his  purposes
—and  to  protect  those  he  wished  by  characterizing—as  he
saw fit—the payments he made to them, even to the point of
perjuring himself with regard to payoffs he made to Lindsay.
Evidence of how Cobb often paid various legislators a few
hundred dollars to “keep them friendly” and that it was no
concern of his how the recipients handled the monies, was
not furnished by the government so as to allow the defendants
to attempt to impeach Cobb's testimony that the payments he
made to these defendants (excluding Long) were known by
him and by them to be bribes.

The court further finds that the government did, in fact, allow
testimony from Cobb, Clemens and Greer that it knew to be
untrue  to  stand  uncorrected.  This  court  shares  the  concern
expressed by the court in United States v. Wallach, 935 F.2d
445, 457 (2d Cir.1991): “We fear that given the importance of
[a witness's] testimony to the case, the prosecutors may have
consciously avoided recognizing the obvious—[that he] was
not telling the truth.”

Once the government entered into the agreement with Cobb
that  he  would  never  have  to  testify  against  Lindsay,  it
put  itself  in  an  untenable  position.  Its  cases  against  these
defendants  rested  in  large  measure  on  Cobb's  testimony  at
trial.  Sufficient  evidence  has  now  been  disclosed  to  prove
that  Cobb  did  pay  a  bribe  to  Lindsay  in  connection  with
the capital gains tax bill and, further, that Cobb admitted as
early  as  May  1,  1989,  that  he  had  paid  Lindsay  a  bribe  in
connection with the oil jobbers bill. His sworn testimony that
he never paid Lindsay a bribe was perjurious several times
over. Unfortunately, SA Clemens had helped to dig the hole
in which he found himself and, apparently, felt he had to play
out the scenario to the end.

When  the  government  found  itself  in  a  position  which
forced  it  to  investigate  Greer,  the  situation  became  even
more  explosive.  There  is  no  way  the  court  can  ignore  the
inconsistencies in and omissions from the record in the matter
of  Greer  and  the  capital  gains  tax  bill.  The  government's
actions  as  outlined  in  this  order  suggest  a  total  avoidance
of  pursuing  information  that  might  have  proved  adverse  to
Greer.  The  record  is  replete  with  implications  that  Greer
was  heavily  involved  in  the  payoffs  related  to  the  capital
gains  tax  bill,  yet  no  FD–302s  or  agents'  rough  notes  of
any  debriefings  of  Greer  regarding  capital  gains  and  no
indication the government ever sought to review his financial
records  can  be  found.  Even  the  information  advanced  by
the  government  at  Greer's  sentencing  that  would  tend  to
be  in  Greer's  favor  is  not  substantiated  by  anything  in  the
record. His testimony before the Grand Jury would have to
be perjured if the arguments advanced by the government at
Greer's  sentencing  hearing  are  true.  Alternatively,  if  Greer
told  the  truth  to  the  Grand  Jury,  then  the  government  has
lied to the court. The government's failure to fully investigate
Greer  might  be  excused  as  falling  within  the  province
of  the  government's  prosecutorial  discretion  if  his  alleged
involvement  was  isolated.  The  fact  that  it  surfaced  in  an
investigation resulting in the convictions of these defendants
and  may  have  had  an  impact  on  the  fairness  of  their  trials
puts the government's handling of Greer's involvement in an
entirely different light.

Most offensive to the court, however, is that the government
sat silent—when it knew that its silence would not only foil
the  efforts  of  the  defendants  to  fully  develop  defenses  to
which they were entitled, but would misrepresent facts to both
the  Grand  Jury  and  the  trial  jury,  and  mislead  the  court  to
such an extent as to effect its rulings at trial and in collateral
proceedings. As reluctant as this court is to call it such—this
silence in several instances constitutes subornation of perjury.

This court will not shrink from its share of responsibility and
admits its total reliance on the government's representations,
at least through the original trials. It did warn the government
on numerous occasions that, if it was not being candid and
forthright, the court would take the appropriate steps available
to  it.  Without  the  defendants'  unrelenting  pursuit  of  their
motions, however, much of what is now known may never
have seen the light of day. The government attempts  *661
to  show  its  willingness  to  own  up  to  any  misconduct  in  a
footnote  to  its  final  memorandum,  stating  that  it  was  the

expanded discovery voluntarily furnished by the government
following  remand  that  led  to  these  motions  and  not  the
defendants'  own  investigative  work  or  requests  under  the
FOIA. [Gov's Post–Hearing Memo, 10/18/96, p. 29, ftn. 13].
Considering the on-going discovery problems in these cases,
the court finds this absurd. Because the Fourth Circuit Court
of Appeals was also unaware of the substantial amount and
probative content of discovery materials withheld, had these
cases  not  been  remanded  for  retrial  on  entirely  different
grounds,  the  convictions  of  these  defendants  would  stand.
It  was  not  until  the  first  wave  of  discovery  for  retrials,
which contained numerous previously withheld documents,
was furnished in November of 1993 that the court had any
reason to believe that some of its previous rulings were based
on limited and/or erroneous information. Thereafter, for the
purposes of the motions to dismiss, it allowed great latitude
in the disclosure of discovery materials. Only then was the
wide-ranging scope of the government's misconduct available
to the defendants and apparent to the court. There is no way to
avoid the conclusion that the various and repeated acts of the
government were simply wrong; that the government acted in
bad faith, and its misconduct is not only greatly offensive to
this court, but has interfered with this court's duty to insure
the proper administration of justice.

In summary, the court is of the opinion that the evidence of
the government's misconduct from the time this investigation
commenced  until  the  present,  in  its  totality,  is  sufficiently
egregious  to  warrant  dismissal  of  these  indictments  with
prejudice  under  the  doctrine  of  supervisory  power.  It  is,
therefore,

ORDERED,  that  the  Superseding  Indictment  in  Criminal
Nos.  3:90–00339  and  3:90–00434  against  defendants
LUTHER  LANGFORD  TAYLOR,  LARRY  BLANDING
and BENJAMIN J. GORDON, JR. be, and the same is hereby
dismissed with prejudice. It is

ORDERED FURTHER, that the Indictment in Criminal No.
3:91–00091  against  defendant  PAUL  WAYNE  DERRICK
be, and the same is hereby dismissed with prejudice. It is

ORDERED  FURTHER,  that  the  Indictment  in  Criminal
No.  3:91–00384  against  defendant  JEFFERSON  MARION
LONG,  JR.  be,  and  the  same  is  hereby,  dismissed  with
prejudice.

AND IT IS SO ORDERED.

The court has also sought to develop some of the issues by reviewing other documents on record in the evidence room.
In the interest of brevity and continuity, the designations of the defendants by their surnames are used to denote the
defendants personally and, where appropriate, to denote the defendants by and through their attorneys.
Three other defendants indicted as a result of the Operation Lost Trust investigation went to trial on Hobbs Act charges.
The convictions of two of these defendants were upheld by the Appeals Court; the third was found not guilty. All other
Lost Trust defendants pleaded to either corruption or drug charges.
The  record  subsequently  shows  that  the  government  made  a  decision  to  “start  over  on  discovery  by  providing  it
again.” [DOJ/OPR Report, 10/18/4, p. 10].
Derrick also filed a separate motion to dismiss on grounds of prosecutorial misconduct and entrapment on April 19,
1995, which he supplemented on September 5, 1995. The government filed its opposition on September 27, 1995. In the
summer of 1996, Derrick requested consideration of this motion without oral argument on the issue of entrapment only,
and dismissal on this ground was denied by this court's order of August 7, 1996.
Upon Daniel's resignation as United States Attorney, John S. Simmons was appointed in early 1992 to that post. Upon
Simmons' resignation effective in April of 1993, Margaret B. Seymour was appointed Interim U.S. Attorney, followed by the
interim appointment of J. Preston Strom in May 1993. Strom's “permanent” appointment became effective July 30, 1993.
The reports of the DOJ/OPR and FBI/OPR dated October 18, 1994, December 6, 1994, and February 16, 1995 [Hearing
4/19/95, Defendants Exhibits 30, 45 and 44 respectively] will be discussed later in this order.
The disclosure of discovery to defendants is primarily the responsibility of the USAO. Unless so distinguished, however,
subsequent references herein to “the government” include all of the government agencies involved in the investigation
and prosecution of these cases. In the eyes of the court there is no difference. Those indicted for crimes have a right to

look to only one body—the government—for due process and a fair trial. One agency cannot point its finger at another,
declaring “it's their fault—it's not our fault.” It is the United States, represented by the United States Attorney, that is
seeking redress; and, if a defendant does not receive a fair trial because of the failure of any one agency, that failure
must be imputed to the government as a whole.
From this period on, the court conducted numerous in camera inspections of discovery materials at the request of the
government. All documents ordered to be turned over to the defendants were done so under protective orders.
The Capital Gains Tax issue is fully addressed hereinafter in this order.
Under the terms of this conditional severance, defendant Gordon was rejoined in this matter by order of January 21, 1997.
Hereinafter, the designation USA is used to denote United States Attorney; the designation AUSA is used to denote
Assistant United States Attorney, and the designation USAO is used to denote United States Attorney's Office.
This motion was denied by The Honorable Charles E. Simons, Jr., U.S.D.J., who was originally assigned to hear this
case. The case was subsequently reassigned to the undersigned.
Co-defendant Fant had pled three days before.
This disclosure followed a hearing on defendant Gordon's Brady motions of November 5, 1990, and January 7, 1991,
wherein the court directed the government to furnish the specified material.
An FBI FD–302 (sometimes referred to herein simply as a 302) is a government form used by the FBI. Its Manual of
Administrative  Operations  and  Procedures,  Part  II,  Section  10–12(3),  requires  that  “[o]riginal  notes  of  interview  with
prospective witnesses and/or suspects and subjects must be retained in the 1A section of the case file. That is, in any
interview where preparation of an FD–302 is required (an interview where it is anticipated the results will become the
subject of court testimony) the rough handwritten notes are to be retained.”

The defendants argue that these FD–302s allowed the primary government witness Cobb to testify falsely. They also
dispute the government's conclusion that these two FD–302s form the only basis for their Brady violation allegations.
Robert Alfred Kohn, who was indicted with Taylor and who pled guilty as previously cited. Kohn also became a government
informant later in the investigation.
The government's memorandum expands on several of these arguments, but, as mentioned earlier in this order, the
specifics of the allegations will be addressed later in this order.
The motions filed in connection with the initial trials have been incorporated by the defendants with the motions to dismiss
filed post-remand in these matters.
Cobb testified at the Long trial that he knew Long was not accepting a bribe under the circumstances in which the money
was exchanged.
A complete listing of the legislators checked off by Cobb includes State Senators James E. Bryan, Herbert U. Fielding,

since its inception, primarily handling the organization of documents. The government did not oppose her qualifications
to testify in this regard.

Also found in these records were copies of seven (7) checks payable to State Senator John Charles Lindsay of Marlboro
County, South Carolina, including two (2) $10,000 checks and one (1) check for over $20,000. [Hearing 10/18–20/95,
Taylor's Exh. 12].
Taylor was first approached about 9:00 a.m. on July 17, 1990, in the driveway of his home by three FBI agents. They
requested that he accompany them to their offices. He was interviewed for approximately seven hours, during which time
he admitted receipt of monies from Cobb that he considered to be campaign contributions. Late in the afternoon, Taylor
acquiesced to appearing before the Grand Jury. He was not told he was a target of the investigation, was not given a
Miranda warning before testifying, and was not asked in the Grand Jury how he categorized the monies he received from
Cobb. Following his testimony, he was taken to a local motel where agents stayed with him overnight in shifts. Clemens
testified at Taylor's trial that Taylor was kept in FBI custody because they were concerned that he was depressed to the
point of being suicidal. However, they also bought him a liter of Scotch whiskey, and it is curious they chose a known
depressant, alcohol, to assist him through this “suicidal” state.

abetting extortion under the Hobbs Act.
Derrick has also pursued a defense of entrapment and cites in his memorandums and arguments to specific evidence
that was withheld which he believes would have supported this defense. In light of the findings herein, the court need
not address the entrapment issue.
Any  grounds  for  dismissal  of  the  indictment  of  Long,  outside  of  those  for  prosecutorial  misconduct,  need  not  be
addressed at this time.
In its opinion dated May 29, 1992, in the Taylor case, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals stated: “The government argues
that Cobb's testimony was not critical to its case and that his credibility was not a significant issue at trial, but a review of
the transcript reveals that these arguments are ludicrous. Cobb was the cornerstone of the prosecution's case and his
credibility was the paramount issue at trial.”  USA v. Taylor, 966 F.2d 830, 837 (4th Cir.1992).
The late Thomas Magnum, a member of the South Carolina House of Representatives.
Defendants further contend that SA Clemens, in fact, had previously testified at an evidentiary hearing in open court.
These notes were among other Lost Trust investigation work papers Clemens maintained at his home in the Washington
area.
The court is aware that the government claims that Lobbyist Lee was helpful to them in the Derrick case.
The only Grand Jury transcript regarding capital gains not removed from the AUSO's file cabinet at this time was the
transcript of Greer's testimony which had been previously pulled from the files.
Michael E. Spears, an attorney representing Cobb at that time.
This incident took place only three (3) days prior to his meeting with defendant Taylor regarding Taylor's support of the
parimutuel bill.
Yolanda C. Courie, co-counsel for defendant Taylor.
In his motion to dismiss on the grounds of entrapment, defendant Derrick claims that Cobb added Derrick to his target list
in revenge for Cobb's loss of a client when Derrick would not support legislation known as the “Tent Sales” bill. In post-
remand discovery furnished to defendants there was found a government file dated April 30, 1991, which contained what
appears to be a manuscript of a proposed book by Cobb entitled The Second Burning of Columbia. The manuscript is in
the form of an interview of Cobb (“R”) and his then-girlfriend, Shelly Adams (“S”), by “D”, later identified by the government
as Doug Williams. A portion of that manuscript reads as follows:

D You knew who they [the government] had files on going in? So there really was, there was a definite universe of
people that you were charged with going after?
R Yeah.
D Did you add to that universe at all for the hell of it?
R Yeah. Paul Derrick big time.

[Hearing, 4/19/95, Taylor Exh. 7, p. 27].

The government did not oppose the publication of this selected portion of the manuscript. It did oppose full publication
on the basis of protection of any copyright privilege Cobb might assert.
The  court  would  take  note,  however,  that  it  was  inappropriate  for  the  USAO  to  conduct  that  press  conference  from
a  courtroom  in  the  United  States  Courthouse.  The  Department  of  Justice  is  an  arm  of  the  Executive  Branch  of  the

government of the United States. In this court's opinion, under the “separation of powers doctrine” of the United States
Constitution, the use of a Federal courtroom by the Department of Justice to further its prosecutorial position blurs the
distinction between the adversary nature of the prosecution and the “blind justice” nature of the courts, which operate
under the Judicial Branch of the United States government.

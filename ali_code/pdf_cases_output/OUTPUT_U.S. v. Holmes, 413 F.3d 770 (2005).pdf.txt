Synopsis
Background: Defendant was convicted in the United States
District Court for the Western District of Missouri, Fernando
J. Gaitan, Jr., J., for being a felon in possession of a firearm.
Defendant appealed.

apartment's  landlord,  that  the  girlfriend's  sister
and her son had lived there and that their lease
had ended shortly before defendant's arrest, and
the proffered testimony of the son, that he was
in  the  process  of  moving  out  of  the  apartment
on  the  day  that  defendant  was  arrested,  were
relevant,  in  prosecution  for  being  a  felon  in
possession of a firearm; defendant testified that
he  had  not  seen  the  gun  in  the  apartment  until
the officers came in and he panicked and pushed
it away from him, arresting officer testified that
defendant retrieved the gun from the back of his
pants,  so  that  proffered  testimony  would  have
provided background and contextual information
that could have been used to assess the relative
credibility of defendant and officer, on issue of
whether defendant possessed the gun. Fed.Rules

Opinion

MELLOY, Circuit Judge.

Xavier Holmes appeals his conviction by a jury of being a
felon in possession of a firearm that had traveled in interstate
commerce, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1). We reverse
and remand for a new trial.

I.

Two  police  officers,  Officer  Snyder  and  Officer  LeMoine,
were dispatched to an apartment where Mr. Holmes and a gun
were found after Brenda Williams (a sister of Mr. Holmes's
girlfriend, Sheila Perry) called 911 and reported that there was
a disturbance at the apartment involving a person armed with
a gun. The door to the apartment was wide open when the
officers arrived, and Brenda invited them inside. In addition
to  Brenda,  Mr.  Holmes  and  Ms.  Perry  were  present  in  the
apartment. The record is unclear as to what role, if any, Mr.
Holmes played in the events leading to the 911 call.

According  to  both  officers'  testimony,  Mr.  Holmes  backed
away from them with his hands behind his back when they
entered  the  apartment,  and  Officer  Snyder  asked  him  to
show  his  hands,  but  Mr.  Holmes  did  not  initially  do  so.
Officer Snyder testified that he followed Mr. Holmes around
a counter, after which Mr. Holmes backed up to a wall and

began  to  pull  a  hand  from  behind  his  back  “as  if  he  was
picking  something  up  from  the  back  of  his  pants.”  Officer
Snyder stated that he unholstered his gun in response to Mr.
Holmes's actions, then began to point his gun at Mr. Holmes
after  observing  that  Mr.  Holmes  was  holding  a  revolver.
According to Officer Snyder, Mr. Holmes did not point the
revolver at anyone, but rather “slid it down his leg,” let go
of  it,  and  it  hit  the  floor.  Officer  Snyder  was  then  assisted
by  Officer  LeMoine  in  handcuffing  Mr.  Holmes.  Officer
LeMoine testified that she never saw Mr. Holmes holding or
dropping a gun, and that she was focused on trying to defuse
the argument between the two women in the apartment, but
that  at  some  point  after  Officer  Snyder  asked  Mr.  Holmes
to show his hands, she “heard a loud clunk like something
had fallen onto the floor.” The officers recovered the revolver
from the floor after they detained Mr. Holmes.

Mr. Holmes's testimony provided an alternative explanation
for how the gun got on the floor. He testified that Carolyn
Williams  (a  sister  of  Brenda  and  Ms.  Perry),  who  had
resided at the apartment where Mr. Holmes and the gun were
discovered, had been incarcerated and asked him in a phone
call to “secure her furniture so nothing would happen to it.”
He explained that he had gone with Ms. Perry to Carolyn's
apartment to retrieve the belongings, that Brenda was at the
apartment when they arrived, and that Ms. Perry and Brenda
got into an argument. He stated that after carrying a television
set from the apartment to the car, he noticed police officers
approaching the  *773  apartment complex, and he went back
into the apartment to “get out of their way,” as he had “been
drinking that day” and “didn't want them to smell it on [his]
breath” because he was on probation. Mr. Holmes testified
that after he walked back into the apartment and was waiting
for  Ms.  Perry  to  tell  him  what  she  wanted  to  move  next,
“the  next  thing  I  know  the  police  were  there  and  I  saw  a
gun  laying  on  the  counter,”  and  “I  panicked  and  pushed  it
over the counter” because “I'm on probation” and “I'm not
supposed  to  be  around  guns.”  He  testified  that  he  had  “no
idea” who owned the gun, and that the moment at which the
police officers arrived was the “first time I ever saw” the gun.
Both  officers  testified  that  they  did  not  see  the  gun  on  the
counter or see Mr. Holmes's hand making a motion towards
the counter.

II.

[1]
 At trial, Mr. Holmes attempted to offer the testimony of
Carolyn and two other witnesses whom he had subpoenaed,
but  the  district  court  refused  to  allow  them  to  testify,
concluding  that  their  testimony  would  be  irrelevant.  Prior
to  the  close  of  his  defense,  Mr.  Holmes  asked  the  court  to
reconsider admitting the testimony of the three witnesses, but
the court again declined to permit the testimony. Mr. Holmes
contends that the exclusion of this testimony was erroneous
and violated his due process right to present a defense. At trial,
Mr. Holmes made offers of proof as to what the witnesses
would have said: Carolyn would have testified that she was
the leaseholder of the apartment, that her lease had expired,
and that she had contacted Mr. Holmes about retrieving her
property from the apartment; the apartment's landlord would
have testified that Carolyn and her son had lived there and that
their lease had ended shortly before the day of Mr. Holmes's
arrest; and Carolyn's son would have testified that he was in
the process of moving out of the apartment on the day that
Mr.  Holmes  was  arrested.  Mr.  Holmes  maintained  that  he
was offering the testimony to show “why he was there, what
he was doing, how he came to be there.” The district court,
however,  responded  that  “[u]nless  one  of  them  is  going  to
say they put the gun on the counter, it's not relevant to this
proceeding.”

[2]
 The district court's only stated rationale for excluding
the  testimony  was  that  it  was  not  relevant.  We  agree  with
Mr. Holmes that this was an improper basis for excluding the
testimony. The excluded testimony was relevant because it
provided background and contextual information that would
have been useful in assessing the relative credibility of the
officers' and Mr. Holmes's testimony. Cf. Old Chief v. United
States,  519  U.S.  172,  186-89,  117  S.Ct.  644,  136  L.Ed.2d
574 (1997); United States v. DeAngelo, 13 F.3d 1228, 1232
(8th Cir.1994), cert. denied, 512 U.S. 1224, 114 S.Ct. 2717,
129 L.Ed.2d 842 (1994). Evidence is relevant so long as it
has “any tendency,” however slight, “to make the existence
of  any  fact  that  is  of  consequence  to  the  determination  of
the action more probable or less probable than it would be
without  the  evidence.”  Fed.R.Evid.  401;  see  United  States
v.  Casares-Cardenas,  14  F.3d  1283,  1287  (8th  Cir.1994),
cert.  denied,  513  U.S.  849,  115  S.Ct.  147,  130  L.Ed.2d
86  (1994).  The  threshold  for  relevance  is  “quite  minimal.”

United  States  v.  Guerrero-Cortez,  110  F.3d  647,  652  (8th
Cir.1997), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 1017, 118 S.Ct. 604, 139
L.Ed.2d  492  (1997).  All  relevant  evidence  is  admissible,
except as otherwise provided by the Constitution, legislation,
or applicable evidentiary rules, and conversely, all irrelevant
evidence is inadmissible. See Fed.R.Evid. 402.

*774  The only disputed issue of material fact at trial was
whether  Mr.  Holmes  had  knowingly  possessed  the  firearm
that the police officers recovered from the apartment. (The
parties stipulated that Mr. Holmes was a convicted felon as
of the date in question and that the gun had been transported
in  interstate  commerce.)  The  jury  was  presented  with  two
inconsistent  accounts  of  how  the  events  surrounding  Mr.
Holmes's  arrest  and  the  recovery  of  the  gun  unfolded.  The
government's theory that Mr. Holmes retrieved the gun from
the  back  of  his  pants  was  supported  by  Officer  Snyder's
testimony  that  he  had  observed  Mr.  Holmes  holding  and
dropping  the  gun  that  was  found  on  the  floor,  and  both
officers' testimony that they had not observed a gun on the
counter  or  Mr.  Holmes's  hand  moving  toward  the  counter.
The jury had to determine whether this was sufficient to prove
beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Holmes had possessed the
firearm despite Mr. Holmes's testimony to the contrary that
he had merely pushed it from the counter upon observing it.

The evidence proffered by Mr. Holmes was relevant because
it would have made his explanation of how the gun came to be
on the ground-that another person had placed it on the kitchen
counter, and that he had pushed it away from him as the police
entered the apartment-somewhat more plausible than it was
without the evidence. Consequently, the evidence would have
been of some value to Mr. Holmes in his efforts to create a
reasonable doubt in the jurors' minds that he had possessed
the  gun.  It  would  have  corroborated  his  contention  that  he
was  present  in  the  apartment  to  help  the  people  who  had
lived there move, and it might have increased the probability
that the apartment was in a state of disarray, that a firearm
normally stored elsewhere had been left by somebody on the
counter  during  the  moving  process,  and  that,  as  a  guest  in
the apartment, he was surprised to discover the gun on the
counter  when  the  police  arrived.  It  might  also  have  tended
to decrease the probability that he was personally armed by
demonstrating that he was at the apartment for a legitimate
nonviolent purpose rather than to pursue some nefarious goal.

which  includes  the  right  to  present  testimony  of  witnesses

357  F.3d  730,  733  (8th  Cir.2004).  The  testimony  of  these
witnesses  is  relevant  and  therefore  a  part  of  Mr.  Holmes's
complete defense. Because we determine below that a retrial
is necessary, we need not consider whether the exclusion of
testimony was harmless. On retrial, these contested witnesses
may offer their testimony.

III.

  Mr.  Holmes  urges  us  to  hold  that  improper

  [5]

[4]
comments made by the government during closing arguments
deprived  him  of  his  fifth  amendment  right  to  a  fair
trial.  The  district  court  has  broad  discretion  in  controlling
closing  arguments,  and  we  overturn  a  conviction  on  the
basis  of  prosecutorial  misconduct  only  upon  a  showing
that  improper  remarks,  in  light  of  any  rulings  or  curative
instructions by the district court and in light of the trial as a
whole, could reasonably have affected the jury's verdict. See
United States v. Conrad, 320 F.3d 851, 855 (8th Cir.2003).
If  the  government  has  made  improper  remarks  to  a  jury,
we  determine  whether  *775   they  deprived  the  defendant
of  a  fair  trial  by  examining  the  “cumulative  effect  of  such
misconduct,” the “strength of the properly admitted evidence
of the defendant's guilt,” and the “curative actions taken by
the trial court.” United States v. Hernandez, 779 F.2d 456,
460  (8th  Cir.1985).  Under  this  standard,  we  find  that  the
cumulative effect of the remarks in this case, coupled with the
exclusion of admissible testimony and the relative weakness
of the government's case, could reasonably have affected the
jury's verdict.

[6]
  Mr.  Holmes  objected  to  a  statement  the  government
made at the beginning of its rebuttal argument: “Mr. Moss
is  a  good  defense  attorney,  tries  to  get  you  to  focus  your
attention  over  here  when  what  really  is  important  is  right
in front of you. It's all smoke and mirrors.” (Mr. Moss was
Mr. Holmes's trial counsel.) The district court overruled Mr.
Holmes's objection that this comment was “improper.” The

government continued to make similar comments about Mr.
Moss  later  in  its  rebuttal  argument,  stating  that  “Mr.  Moss
wants to distract you and tell you about all this other evidence
that's  not  important,”  and  that  issues  that  Mr.  Moss  had
raised about who had owned the gun in question were a “red
herring.” The government also commented that “Mr. Moss
needs to make sure that they get their stories straight” (“they”
presumably referred to Mr. Moss and Mr. Holmes), and that
the jury should “look at Mr. Moss's story. That's why I said
he's got to get his stories straight.”

[7]
  We  think  that  these  various  comments  referring
personally  to  Mr.  Moss  and  the  necessity  for  Mr.  Moss
to  “get  his  stories  straight,”  taken  as  a  whole  and  in  the
context of the rebuttal argument, show that the government
attorney was accusing defense counsel of conspiring with the
defendant to fabricate testimony. These types of statements
are highly improper because they improperly encourage the
jury to focus on the conduct and role of Mr. Holmes's attorney
rather  than  on  the  evidence  of  Mr.  Holmes's  guilt.  Such
personal, unsubstantiated attacks on the character and ethics
of opposing counsel have no place in the trial of any criminal
or civil case.

[8]
  More  than  thirty-five  years  ago  our  court  found  such
statements  to  be  improper.  See  Cline  v.  United  States,  395
F.2d  138,  141  (8th  Cir.1968)  (finding  it  improper  for  a
prosecutor  to  accuse  defense  counsel  of  dishonesty).  Such
statements  are  improper  because  a  prosecutor's  comment
“carries with it the imprimatur of the Government and may
induce the jury to trust the Government's judgment rather than
its own view of the evidence.” United States v. Young, 470
U.S. 1, 18-19, 105 S.Ct. 1038, 84 L.Ed.2d 1 (1985). They are
also improper because the role of the prosecutor is not merely
to  pursue  convictions,  but  to  pursue  justice-“the  twofold
aim  of  which  is  that  guilt  shall  not  escape  or  innocence
suffer.”  Berger  v.  United  States,  295  U.S.  78,  88,  55  S.Ct.
629,  79  L.Ed.  1314  (1935).  In  pursuit  of  these  dual  goals,
a government attorney may “prosecute with earnestness and
vigor  ...  may  strike  hard  blows  ...  [but]  is  not  at  liberty  to
strike foul ones.” Id. Accordingly, prosecutors may not inject
their own testimony nor cast aspersions upon the defendant
through offhand comments, suggestions of conspiracy with
defense  counsel,  nor  personal  attacks  upon  the  integrity  of
defense counsel. See McDonnell v. United States, 457 F.2d
1049,  1052-53  (8th  Cir.1972)  (finding  that  a  prosecutor
deserved censure for admittedly describing defense counsel's

offer  of  proof  as  a  “common  trick,”  but  finding  no  abuse
of discretion in the denial of a motion for mistrial because
the judge and reporter had not  *776  heard the remark and
the  court  of  appeals  was  unwilling  to  assume  the  jury  had
heard the remark); see also United States v. Pungitore, 910
F.2d  1084,  1142  (3d  Cir.1990)  (collecting  cases);  United
States v. Murrah, 888 F.2d 24, 27 (5th Cir.1989) (reversing
conviction  because  prosecutor  improperly  accused  defense
counsel  of  hiding  expert  witness  to  prevent  government's
use  of  witness);  United  States  v.  McLain,  823  F.2d  1457,
1462-63  (11th  Cir.1987)  (reversing  conviction  under  plain
error  standard  in  part  because  prosecutor  repeatedly  stated
that  defense  counsel  “intentionally  misle[d]  the  jurors  and
witnesses and ... [lied] in court”), overruled on other grounds
by United States v. Lane, 474 U.S. 438, 449, 106 S.Ct. 725, 88
L.Ed.2d 814 (1986) (as recognized in United States v. Watson,
866 F.2d 381, 385 n. 3 (1989)).

It  is  particularly  disturbing  that  the  comments  were  made
during  the  rebuttal  phase  of  closing  argument.  See  United
States  v.  Cannon,  88  F.3d  1495,  1503  (8th  Cir.1996)
(reversing  a  conviction  based  on  a  prosecutor's  improper
remarks during closing and noting, “Because the remark came
during  rebuttal  arguments,  defense  counsel  was  unable  to
respond except by objection.”); United States v. Johnson, 968
F.2d 768, 772 (8th Cir.1992) (reversing a conviction based on
prosecutor's improper comments during the rebuttal phase of
closing arguments); see also United States v. Carter, 236 F.3d
777, 788 (6th Cir.2001) (improper comments during rebuttal
constituted “the last words from an attorney that were heard
by the jury before deliberations”). In Cline, our court found
an  improper  comment  non-prejudicial  specifically  because
the comment was an “isolated remark ... made early in the
trial.”  Cline,  395  F.2d  at  142  (emphasis  added).  Here,  in
contrast,  the  prosecutor's  improper  comment  came  in  the
rebuttal phase of closing arguments. Defense counsel was left
with no opportunity to rebut the allegations and the jury heard
the  remark  immediately  before  deliberations.  The  potential
for  prejudice  is  great  during  closing  arguments,  especially
when the defense has no opportunity for rebuttal.

[9]
 The strength of the government's case, like the timing
of  improper  comments,  is  also  a  factor  relevant  to  our
determination of prejudice. Cannon, 88 F.3d at 1503 (“[A]n
improper argument is less likely to have affected the verdict
in  a  case  when  the  evidence  is  overwhelming  than  in  a
case  where  the  evidence  is  weak.”);  Johnson,  968  F.2d

at  772  (“[T]he  evidence  of  Johnson's  guilt  is  far  from
overwhelming.”). Here, the government's case was less than
overwhelming.  This  is  a  case  where  one  police  officer,
Officer Snyder, presented a version of the facts that conflicted
with  the  defendant's  version  of  the  facts.  A  second  police
officer, Officer Le Moine, offered testimony that could have
supported either explanation. (She verified that she heard a
clunk and saw the gun on the floor, but her failure to see Mr.
Holmes move his hand towards the counter is easily explained
by the fact that she was diffusing the argument between the
two women and not looking at Mr. Holmes.) Further, when
assessing the relative strength of the government's case and
the potential for prejudice, we must consider the cumulative
effect  of  the  fact  that  relevant  evidence  favorable  to  the
defendant was improperly excluded.

As noted above, improper comments merit reversal if we find
that those comments, in the context of the trial as a whole,
could  reasonably  have  affected  the  jury's  verdict.  Here  the
standard has been met. Because the government's case was
not strong, witnesses offered by the defense were improperly
excluded, the comments occurred during rebuttal arguments,

 Mr. Holmes next contends that the district court erred
by  failing  to  give  an  instruction  to  the  jury  limiting  the
evidentiary use of his prior felony convictions. Rule 105 of
the Federal Rules of Evidence provides that “[w]hen evidence
which is admissible ... for one purpose but not admissible ...
for  another  purpose  is  admitted,  the  court,  upon  request,
shall restrict the evidence to its proper scope and instruct the
jury accordingly.” In accordance with Rule 105, Mr. Holmes
requested that the district court give an instruction that stated:

You  have  heard  evidence 
that
the  defendant  Xavier  Holmes  was
previously convicted of a crime. You
may  use  that  evidence  only  to  help
you  decide  whether  to  believe  his
testimony  and  how  much  weight  to
give it. That evidence does not mean

that  he  committed  the  crime  charged
here,  and  you  must  not  use  that
evidence as proof of the crime charged
in this case.

This proposed instruction was taken verbatim from the Eighth
Circuit's  model  jury  instruction  relating  to  impeachment
of  a  defendant's  testimony  by  a  prior  conviction.  See
Eighth Circuit Manual of Model Jury Instructions-Criminal,
Instruction  *778   2.16.  The  government  opposed  the  use
of  Mr.  Holmes's  proposed  instruction  because  it  did  not
anticipate “arguing any sort of propensity in this case,” and
because  the  instruction  would  confuse  the  jury  since  one
of the elements of the crime charged was the fact that Mr.
Holmes was a convicted felon. This was the only instruction
on this matter that Mr. Holmes asked for, and the district court
refused to give it.

The district court did not err in declining to instruct the jury
as  Mr.  Holmes  requested  because  the  proposed  instruction
was an erroneous statement of the law. One of the essential
elements  of  the  crime  of  being  a  felon  in  possession  of  a
firearm is that the defendant has “been convicted [of] a crime
punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.”
18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1). The evidence of Mr. Holmes's prior
felony convictions was thus not only admissible to shed light
on his credibility as a witness, it was substantive evidence that
he had committed the charged offense. A direction that the
jury “must not” use evidence of Mr. Holmes's previous felony
convictions “as proof of the crime charged in this case” would
simply have been wrong.

VI.

We reverse and remand for a new trial.

MORRIS SHEPPARD ARNOLD, Circuit Judge, dissenting.
I would not reverse this conviction based on the remarks that
the  government's  counsel  made  during  closing  arguments.
The  court  indulges  every  presumption  against  a  benign
construction of those remarks and its characterization of their
purport is harsh. In my judgment, the statements objected to
did not directly implicate defense counsel's honesty.

I  see  no  reason,  moreover,  to  believe  that  the  statements
had  a  substantially  injurious  effect  on  the  outcome  of  the
case.  Juries  know  that  argument  is  not  evidence;  it  is  just
talk. For all that we can know, the argument may well have
gotten the jury's back up and prejudiced the government rather
than the defendant. The court presumes that juries are a lot
more impressionable than experience will allow for, and gives
them too little credit for a common sense ability to discount
vituperation  and  hyperbole  and  to  restrict  themselves  to  a
consideration of the evidence adduced at trial.

There is nothing in this case to differentiate it from the scores,
perhaps hundreds of cases that have routinely come before us
in the last thirty or forty years in which an identical argument
has  been  rejected  out  of  hand.  This  counsels  more  caution
than the court employs in the present circumstances.

V.

I  would  uphold  this  judgment  and  therefore  respectfully
dissent.

Mr. Holmes also raises a sentencing issue under Blakely v.
Washington, 542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403
(2004). In light of our remand order, we need not address this
issue.

The government made two other potentially prejudicial comments. Taken in isolation, we believe that the district court
adequately  mitigated  the  impact  of  these  other  comments  through  its  curative  actions.  Nevertheless,  we  strongly
recommend  that  prosecutors  not  make  such  comments,  and  the  cumulative  effect  of  these  comments  added  to  the
potential for prejudice in this case.

U.S. v. Holmes, 413 F.3d 770 (2005)
67 Fed. R. Evid. Serv. 804

Mr. Holmes objected during rebuttal argument when the government told the jury that “to buy the defendant's story you
have to believe that Officer Snyder and Officer LeMoine were lying.” Mr. Holmes objected that this argument constituted
impermissible “burden shifting,” and his objection was overruled. Though the testimony of the officers and Mr. Holmes
were contradictory in important respects, and Mr. Holmes attacked the credibility of the officers as part of his defense,
Mr. Holmes proposed the theory in his closing argument that the officers were merely “mistaken” in their perceptions
based on the “stress” and “intensity” of the situation. The government's contention that Mr. Holmes's testimony about
the gun could be believed only if both police officers were “lying” was, therefore, an incorrect characterization of the
dispositive factual issue and of Mr. Holmes's theory of defense. Although the district court overruled Mr. Holmes's
objection to the government's statement in this instance, the district court partially mitigated the impact of the statement
by properly instructing the jury regarding the burden of proof.
The government also argued to the jury that “at the beginning of the trial [Mr. Holmes] is entitled to a presumption
of innocence until evidence is presented. When he takes that stand, he's not presumed to be telling the truth.” The
district court sustained Mr. Holmes's objection that this line of argument was a misstatement of the law, stating during
a bench conference that the government was “crossing over the bounds,” and that Mr. Holmes “has the presumption of
innocence until the jury finds he is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.” At the end of the government's rebuttal argument,
the district court properly instructed the jury that “the defendant's presumption of innocence follows him throughout the
trial” and “doesn't automatically go away when he gets on the witness stand and testifies.”
While the government's statement that a defendant who testifies is not presumed to be telling the truth was correct, the
suggestion that the presumption of innocence in a criminal trial ceases to apply when the government presents evidence
was misleading, and the district court thus appropriately sustained the objection and gave the curative instruction. The
district court's actions undoubtedly helped to dispel any confusion or undo any prejudice that might have arisen as a
result of the comment about the burden of proof.

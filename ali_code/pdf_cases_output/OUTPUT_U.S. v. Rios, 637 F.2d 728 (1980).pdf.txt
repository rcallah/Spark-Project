Opinion

SETH, Chief Judge.

This  Abney  appeal  is  taken  from  denial  of  a  motion
to  bar  retrial  based  on  the  double  jeopardy  clause  of
the  Fifth  Amendment.  The  only  issue  is  whether  the
prosecutor's  behavior  during  the  first  trial  constituted
deliberate misconduct intended to provoke a mistrial motion
and  whether  the  double  jeopardy  clause  is  thus  invoked  to
bar  retrial.  See  United  States  v.  Dinitz,  424  U.S.  600,  96
S.Ct. 1075, 47 L.Ed.2d 267. Defendant Rios at his first trial
was convicted by a jury of possession of heroin with intent
to distribute. Defense counsel moved for a mistrial after the
prosecution's closing argument urging that improper remarks
had  prejudiced  the  defendant.  The  motion  was  denied.

U.S. v. Rios, 637 F.2d 728 (1980)

We  reversed  the  conviction  in  United  States  v.  Rios,  611
F.2d  1335  (10th  Cir.),  because  prosecutorial  misconduct
prevented a fair trial.

Defendant moved at his second trial to bar retrial based on
double jeopardy. An  *729  evidentiary hearing was held on
the issue, and the motion was denied. This appeal followed.

This  case  is  somewhat  different  from  the  Dinitz  line  of
cases in which prosecutorial misconduct actually caused a
mistrial  to  be  granted  in  the  trial  court.  Here,  the  mistrial
motion  was  denied.  The  same  procedural  situation  was
however  presented  to  the  Pennsylvania  Supreme  Court  in
Commonwealth  v.  Potter,  478  Pa.  251,  386  A.2d  918.  See
also the comment, The Double Jeopardy Clause and Mistrials
Granted on Defendant's Motion: What Kind of Prosecutorial
Misconduct Precludes Reprosecution? 18 Duquesne L.Rev.
103 (1979). Although equally divided on the final judgment,
the majority of the justices in Potter concluded that reversal
of a conviction for prosecutorial misconduct after a mistrial
has been denied should be treated the same for purposes of
double jeopardy analysis as if the mistrial had been granted
in the first instance, and said:

in 

[1]
  We  conclude  that  double  jeopardy  considerations
applicable  after  a  mistrial  has  been  granted  are  indeed
the  same  manner  when  prosecutorial
applicable 
misconduct  requires  reversal  of  a  conviction  for  lack  of  a
fair  trial  after  a  mistrial  motion  has  been  denied.  We  have
dealt with the standard for retrial after a mistrial is caused by
prosecutorial misconduct in United States v. Leonard, 593
F.2d 951, 954 (10th Cir.). We there stated:

“The  Double  Jeopardy  Clause  does  protect  a  defendant
against governmental actions intended to provoke mistrial
requests and thereby to subject defendants to the substantial
burdens imposed by multiple prosecutions. It bars retrials
where ‘bad-faith conduct by judge or prosecutor,’ United
States v. Jorn, supra, at (400 U.S. 470) 485, (91 S.Ct. 547
at  557,  27  L.Ed.2d  543)  threatens  the  ‘(h)  arassment  of
an accused by successive prosecutions or declaration of a
mistrial so as to afford the prosecution a more favorable
opportunity to convict’ the defendant.”

See also our United States v. Brooks, 599 F.2d 943, 945 (10th
Cir.):

“As we have noted, appellant's mistrial
motions  during  the  course  of  the
second trial were denied, but were later
deemed  meritorious  by  the  court  en
banc,  with  the  result  that  a  new  trial
was awarded. The question then arises
whether  the  fact  that  a  new  trial  was
the result of a decision by a reviewing
court  rather  than  the  declaration  of  a
mistrial by the trial judge requires that
the  exceptions  to  the  Ball  principle
cannot  be  considered.  We  think  not;
a  distinction  between  granting  a  new
trial  at  the  urging  of  a  defendant
and  ordering  a  mistrial  at  his  request
is  without  significance  for  double
jeopardy  purposes.  Recent  cases  in
the  Supreme  Court  of  the  United
States  have  emphasized  that  in  the
field  of  federal  criminal  practice
the  applicability  of  double  jeopardy
analysis  is  not  dependent  on  nice
procedural distinctions.”

“In  Dinitz,  the  Supreme  Court  held
that  a  request  by  a  defendant  for
a  mistrial  ordinarily  removes  any
barrier to his reprosecution, even if the
request  is  prompted  by  prosecutorial
or  judicial  error.  Under  Dinitz,  the
only  exception  to  the  general  rule  is
where bad faith conduct by the judge
or prosecutor threatens harassment of
an accused by successive prosecution
so as to afford the prosecution a more
favorable opportunity to convict.”

Accord, United States v. Clayborne, 584 F.2d 346 (10th Cir.);
United States v. Nelson, 582 F.2d 1246 (10th Cir.); United
States v. Rumpf, 576 F.2d 818 (10th Cir.); United States v.
Buzzard, 540 F.2d 1383 (10th Cir.).

  Thus  “  ‘(t)he  Double  Jeopardy  Clause  does  protect  a
defendant against governmental actions intended to provoke
mistrial  requests  and  thereby  to  subject  defendants  to  the
substantial  burdens  imposed  by  multiple  prosecutions.’  ”

U.S. v. Rios, 637 F.2d 728 (1980)

57 L.Ed.2d 65, citing United States v. Dinitz, 424 U.S. at 611,
96 S.Ct. at 1081.

[3]
  Under  this  standard,  retrial  is  allowable  here  because
the  record  demonstrates  that  the  prosecutor  did  not  intend
to cause  *730  a mistrial request to further the chances of
conviction.  The  trial  court  so  found.  At  the  hearing  on  the
motion to bar reprosecution, the prosecutor testified that he
definitely did not want to retry the case for several reasons.

The  trial  court  found  no  action  by  the  prosecution  was
intended to cause a mistrial, and the evidence supports this
finding. Although such prosecutorial misconduct is not to
be  condoned,  “bad  faith  in  the  abstract  does  not  help  the
defendant in any event. It must be bad faith, the impact of
which provokes a mistrial request.” United States v. Leonard,
593 F.2d 951, 954 (10th Cir.).

We cannot conclude under the circumstances revealed in the
record that provoking a mistrial request was a motive of the
prosecutor.  The  record  instead  indicates  that  a  very  strong
case had been made against the defendant, that government
witnesses might not be again available, and that no purpose
would  have  been  served  by  forcing  a  mistrial  in  order
to  enhance  the  prosecution's  opportunity  for  conviction  at
another trial.

AFFIRMED.

McKAY, Circuit Judge, dissenting:
In  Lee  v.  United  States,  432  U.S.  23,  97  S.Ct.  2141,
52  L.Ed.2d  80  (1977),  the  Supreme  Court  characterized
the  rule  laid  down  in  United  States  v.  Dinitz,  424  U.S.
600,  96  S.Ct.  1075,  47  L.Ed.2d  267  (1976),  as  follows:
“(T)here  was  no  double  jeopardy  barrier  to  petitioner's
retrial unless the judicial or prosecutorial error that prompted
petitioner's motion was ‘intended to provoke’ the motion or
was otherwise ‘motivated by bad faith or undertaken to harass
or prejudice’ petitioner.” 432 U.S. at 33-34, 97 S.Ct. at 2147
(quoting United States v. Dinitz, 424 U.S. at 611, 96 S.Ct. at
1081) (emphasis added).

The Court's failure to find a double jeopardy violation in Lee
was based on the majority's conclusion that the prosecution's
conduct  did  not  evidence  bad  faith.  That  element  has  been

supplied  here  by  our  own  decision  in  the  previous  appeal
of  this  case,  United  States  v.  Rios,  611  F.2d  1335  (10th
Cir.  1979).  There  we  effectively  held  that  the  prosecutor's
comments constituted gross prosecutorial misconduct:

The  effect  of  these  assertions  before  the  jury  was  that
defense  counsel's  investigator  was  clearly  charged  with
contriving  the  defense  testimony,  with  no  factual  basis
to  justify  such  a  serious  charge.  Similar  comments  have
been  condemned  by  this  court  recently  in  United  States
v. Siviglia, No. 76-1914 (10th Cir. 6/5/78) (unpublished).
There  counsel  argued  that  a  witness  had  lied  because
defense counsel had told him to do so. We emphatically
stated (slip op. 33-34):

We hold and conclude that the prosecutor's comments
constituted  gross  prosecutorial  misconduct  requiring
reversal of Siviglia's conviction ....

Second, there were remarks clearly directed at the appellant
in the closing rebuttal, drawing an inference that appellant
had threatened the safety of the Vega brothers who were
testifying against him. There was no evidence linking the
appellant to any such threats to the Vegas and the innuendo
was unfounded and unfair....

Third,  there  was  a  strong  statement  of  the  prosecuting
attorney's conclusion that the appellant was a large dealer
in heroin....

We must agree that the effect of this rebuttal argument was
to impress the jury with the prosecuting attorney's personal
conclusion  that  the  appellant  was  guilty.  Such  remarks
expressing the personal opinion of the prosecuting attorney
have been emphatically disapproved....

...In such a case, with so much riding on the credibility of
the appellant, and in view of the errors discussed, we must
hold  that  the  prosecutorial  misconduct  was  prejudicial
error which denied appellant a fair trial.

*731  United States v. Rios, 611 F.2d 1335, 1342-43 (10th
Cir. 1979) (footnotes and citations omitted). Such conduct is,
in my opinion, tantamount to bad faith.

To  suggest  that  the  double  jeopardy  clause  is  not  violated
unless the defendant can show (presumably only through the
prosecutor's  confession)  that  the  subjective  purpose  of  the
prosecutor was to obtain a mistrial invites the prosecution to

a new trial. Such a conclusion offends the spirit of Dinitz and
Lee and the requirements of the double jeopardy clause. Any
suggestion to the contrary in our previous cases, see United

be followed.

v.

Michael L. CARUCCI, Defendant.

No. CRIM.97–10060–REK.

 |  Aug. 15, 2002.

Jury  returned  guilty  verdict  on  six  federal  counts  of
engaging  in  transactions  in  criminally  derived  property.
Defendant  moved  for  judgment  of  acquittal  and  for
new  trial.  The  District  Court,  Keeton,  J.,  held  that:  (1)
evidence  was  insufficient  to  satisfy  knowledge  element  as
to  four  of  six  subject  transactions  that  bore  no  indicia
of  being  out  of  the  ordinary;  (2)  evidence  was  sufficient
to  satisfy  knowledge  element  as  to  remaining  two  counts
involving  insufficiently  identified  bank  account  holder;  (3)
prosecutorial misconduct, consisting of overcharging, did
not warrant dismissal of two remaining counts or new trial on
those counts.

II. Procedural History of This Case

A. The Indictment
On March 11, 1997, a Grand Jury of the United States District
Court  for  the  District  of  Massachusetts  returned  a  103–
Count Indictment against Stephen J. Flemmi and Michael L.
Carucci. It charged only Flemmi in Counts 67–69. It charged
against both,

in  Counts  2–66,  substantive  money-laundering  offenses
under 18 U.S.C. § 1956;

in  Counts  70–102,  transactions  in  criminally  derived
property under 18 U.S.C. § 1957; and

in  Count  103,  a  RICO  Conspiracy  under  18  U.S.C.  §
1962(d).

(Docket No. 1, filed March 11, 1997).

the 

indictment  were  Money  Laundering
Concluding 
Forfeiture  Allegations 
and  Racketeering  Forfeiture
Allegations, the practical effect of which was to deprive both
defendants of access to their respective interests in numerous
real estate parcels and bank accounts, regardless of whether or
not the government would be able to prove its charges at trial.

The indictment also alleged that Stephen J. Flemmi had been
involved “continuously since the 1960s ... in organized crime
within  the  District  of  Massachusetts  and  elsewhere”  and
during the 1970s “acted in a supervisory position in a criminal
organization known by various names, including ‘The Winter
Hill Gang’ and ‘South Boston.’ ” The opening paragraph of
the “INTRODUCTION” of the indictment added, as part of
paragraph (a):

In  or  about  1979,  the  defendant
STEPHEN  J.  FLEMMI  and  James
J.  Bulger  became  the  leaders  of  the
Winter  Hill  Gang.  The  defendant
STEPHEN J. FLEMMI has remained
a leader of the Winter Hill Gang up to
the date of this indictment.

Id.

After  allegations  in  part  (b)  about  income  from  unlawful
activity  as  sources  of  Flemmi's  income  and  allegations
in  part  (c)  about  MLC  Properties  Inc.,  d/b/a  Group
Boston  Real  Estate  (also  called  Group  Boston),  as  a
Massachusetts  Corporation  engaged  in  the  business  of
brokering, managing, developing, and investing in real estate
properties, characterizing it as a  *120  “financial institution”
as that phrase is used in 18 U.S.C. § 1956(c)(6) and 31 U.S.C.
§ 5312(a)(2), the INTRODUCTION continued:

(d)  The  defendant  MICHAEL  L.  CARUCCI  is  the
President, Clerk, Treasurer and Director of Group Boston
and  owns  100%  of  the  outstanding  shares  of  stock  in
Group Boston. The defendant MICHAEL L. CARUCCI is
a person involved in real estate closings and settlements,
and is engaged in, and has activities which affect, interstate
and foreign commerce.

(e)  Between  approximately  1991  and  the  present,  the
defendant  MICHAEL  L.  CARUCCI  has  participated
in  multiple  business  and  real  estate  ventures  with  the
defendant  STEPHEN  J.  FLEMMI,  as  the  defendant
FLEMMI's partner and otherwise.

Id.

B. Availability of Prompt Trial
The judge to whom this case was randomly drawn under the
court's assignment system was available to try the charges in
this  case  against  both  defendants  together,  or  against  them
separately  in  sequence,  as  appropriate,  during  the  period
provided by law for speedy trial in the absence of excludable
time apart from that incident to severance, if severance had
been  determined  to  be  appropriate.  It  was  approximately
five  years  before  any  part  of  the  case  came  to  trial.  Trial
commenced  with  jury  selection  on  March  11,  12,  and  14,
2002, on 100 of 103 Counts, and against defendant Carucci
only. The court at all times after indictment in 1997 had been
prepared  to  try  the  case  promptly  upon  its  being  ready  for
trial.  For  a  period  of  a  few  months  the  originally  assigned
judge would have been unavailable because of major surgery,
and the case would then have been tried before another judge
of  the  court.  But  the  originally  assigned  judge  was  again
available before any part of the case was ready for trial.

C. The Pattern of Delay
On  the  full  record  that  is  now  before  me  in  this  case,
I  find  that  the  United  States  Attorney  for  the  District  of
Massachusetts and the Assistant United States Attorneys to
whom he assigned responsibility for prosecution of this case
chose not to seek a prompt trial. Either according to an initial
plan or by a series of decisions as circumstances associated
with  the  case  developed,  they  preferred  to  delay  trial  for
approximately five years. Each of the defendants also had his
own distinctive reasons for preferring delay over prompt trial.

U.S. v. Carucci, 222 F.Supp.2d 117 (2002)

Thus, all parties requested extensions of time on grounds the
court found acceptable and consistent with excludable-time
provisions of rules regarding speedy trial rights of the public
and the parties.

D. Status of the Case at Time of Impanelment
When  the  government  eventually  declared  it  was  ready  to
proceed with trial, it was barred from proceeding with the trial
against defendant Stephen J. Flemmi under a plea agreement
in United States v. Stephen J. Flemmi, Criminal Number 94–
10287–MLW, a case in which the indictment also included
allegations of money laundering and conspiracy to commit
money  laundering.  (See  United  States'  Motion  to  Dismiss
Indictment  with  Respect  to  Defendant  Stephen  J.  Flemmi,
Docket No. 186, filed March 18, 2002; the court allowed that
motion by an endorsement on its margin on March 19, 2002).

Before  the  trial  commenced,  the  court  concluded  also  that
discovery requests and motions to dismiss all or at least some
counts  of  the  indictment  against  the  defendant  Michael  L.
Carucci, ultimately determined to be meritorious at least in
part,  *121  had to be heard and decided before the court could
properly submit the case to the jury that was impaneled on
March 11, 12, and 14, 2002.

The  court  denied  the  requests  that  the  court  hold  an
evidentiary hearing and make its decision on whether it would
submit  the  conspiracy  charges  against  Michael  L.  Carucci
before impaneling a jury. The court gave notice that instead
it would follow the practice of making its final decision on
that  matter  after  the  close  of  all  the  evidence,  as  approved
and directed by the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in,
among  other  cases,  United  States  v.  Ciampaglia,  628  F.2d
632, 638 (1st Cir.1980), and United States v. Bradshaw, 281
F.3d 278, 284 (1st Cir.2002).

Because  the  government  still  had  not  disclosed  admissible
evidence  sufficient  for  the  case  to  go  to  the  jury  against
defendant Michael L. Carucci on either of the two conspiracy
Counts, the court warned government counsel that it would
allow  a  mistrial  if  requested  by  defendant  Carucci  on
adequately  supported  grounds  that  the  government  had
withheld evidence that it should have disclosed in advance
of trial and in fact disclosed only during trial, and that if the
government did not produce during trial admissible evidence
sufficient  to  close  the  gaps  in  the  governments's  advance

proffer  of  evidence  to  show  that  Carucci  had  knowingly
become a member of a conspiracy charged against him, the
court expected to direct acquittal at least on the conspiracy
counts  and  possibly  on  substantive  counts  on  which  the
court  had  declined  to  direct  acquittal  before  impanelment
but  with  notice  that  it  would  consider  on  the  merits,  count
by count, after the close of evidence and before submission
to the jury, the defense motion for acquittal because of the
government's failure to persuade the court that it had a valid
legal theory, supported by adequate evidence for submission
of each particular count to the jury.

E. Order of Acquittal on Specified Counts Before
Submission of Other Counts to the Jury
Near the conclusion of the Rule 29 Hearing, on April 4, 2002,
the court stated and explained its order of acquittal on Counts
1, 14–66, 76–103. (Transcript of Rule 29 Hearing of April
4,  2002,  Docket  No.  263,  at  pp.  30–33).  As  noted  before,
Carucci was not charged in Counts 67–69.

Thus, the counts remaining to be submitted to the jury were
Counts 2–13 and 70–75. See id. at p. 33.

F. Verdict
In the Verdict received on April 16, 2002, the jury found the
defendant:

• NOT GUILTY on Counts 2–13, and

• GUILTY on Counts 70–75.

(Verdict, Docket No. 258).

III. Applicable Law

A. Reservations Stated by the Court in the Charge
Conference
In  the  Charge  Conference  of  April  5,  2002,  very  helpful
suggestions of counsel for the government and the defendant
clarified  issues  that  had  been  troubling  in  earlier  hearings.
With the benefit of these suggestions, the court was then and
still is now satisfied that the charge given to the jury correctly
states the law on nearly all of the issues addressed.

U.S. v. Carucci, 222 F.Supp.2d 117 (2002)

On  a  few  of  the  objections  then  made  and  later  stated  by
defense  counsel,  after  the  charge  was  given  to  the  jury
and  before  they  commenced  deliberations,  I  expressed  my
concern  and  gave  notice  of  my  willingness  to  reconsider
afresh  in  post-verdict  proceedings  any  matters  essential  to
deciding what rulings I should make on post-verdict motions.
These matters are  *122  identified in the Transcript of the
Charge Conference (Docket No. 264).

(1)  One  issue  of  ongoing  concern  was  whether  the
government had advanced or could advance any valid legal
theory  of  conspiracy  together  with  a  proffer  of  admissible
evidence sufficient to support a finding of a conspiracy that
defendant Carucci had manifested agreement to becoming a
member of the conspiracy. See defense counsel's argument,
id. at 3–6, and my response, id. at 6–7.

(2)  Another  issue  concerned  whether  the  government  had
advanced or could advance, for each substantive count, any
viable  legal  theory  together  with  a  proffer  of  admissible
evidence sufficient to support a jury finding of each of the
elements  of  the  substantive  offense  identified  by  that  legal
theory beyond reasonable doubt.

issues  concerning  whether 

Among  the  subsidiary  issues  bearing  on  particular  counts
were 
the  government  had
proffered or ever could proffer admissible evidence sufficient
to  support  a  finding  that  profits  from  any  of  the  alleged
unlawful  activities  ended  up  in  bank  accounts  upon  which
checks  to  American  Equipment,  produced  by  Flemmi
individually or through the Mary Irene Trust, were drawn. Id.
at 24.

Another  subsidiary  issue  concerned  whether  Flemmi's
daughter, Jeannette Benedetti, or others in the family, gave
to  RECOLL  Management  funds  derived  from  identifiable
unlawful activities for the purchase of a condominium from
or  through  RECOLL  Management.  See  defense  counsel's
argument, id. at 3–6, and my response, id. at 6–7.

Another  subsidiary  issue  concerned  causal  connection.
Defendant agreed that the government was not required under
18  U.S.C.  §  1956  to  trace  proceeds  of  a  particular  sale  (or
other transaction) to a particular specified unlawful activity,
id. at 24, but argued that the government had to show some
causal connection between an identifiable unlawful activity

and bank funds used in the transaction charged in a particular
count, id. at 3, 24.

(3) Another set of issues concerned the instructions on willful
blindness. See id. at 20–24.

(4)  Another  set  of  issues  concerned  the  defense  contention
of  government  misconduct  by  concealment,  id.  at  31,  and
the  defense  contention  that  one  or  more  counts  should  be
dismissed  by  application  of  a  legal  test  for  dismissal  of
charges in an indictment under a “factors” analysis, id. at 32–
33.

(5) Another set of issues concerned the use and meaning in
various contexts of the word “willfully,” id., at 34–36, 39.

(6)  Another  set  of  issues  concerned  the  defense  contention
that  the  government  had  proffered  no  admissible  evidence,
direct  or  circumstantial,  that  Flemmi  collected  extortionate
extensions of credit, id. at 49–52.

B. Applicable Law as Stated in the Charge to the Jury
Excerpts  from  the  Charge  to  the  Jury  that  are  potentially
relevant  to  issues  remaining  for  decision  on  post-verdict
motions are recited here:

The charges submitted to you are in Counts 2–13 and 70–
75 of the indictment.

. . . . .

Counts 70–75 charge that the defendant Michael Carucci,
along with Stephen Flemmi, knowingly violated the statute
prohibiting  monetary  transactions  in  criminally  derived
property, with a value of over $10,000, in violation of Title
18, United States Code, Section 1957.

The  defendant  contends  that  he  did  not  know  that  any
of the funds involved in the purchase of the commercial
condominium at 362 Commonwealth Avenue,  *123  the
equipment from Commonwealth Laundry, or the services
from  Mr.  Heat  derived  from  any  unlawful  activity  by
Stephen Flemmi. He instead believed that the funds used by
Flemmi or his family were legitimate funds derived from
bank accounts. Even if you believe that Mr. Carucci was
aware that Flemmi's reputation was not favorable, absent
proof  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt  that  he  knew  that  the

Williams, Brooke 6/26/2015

funds for the specific transactions that are the subject of
Counts 2–13 and 70–75 derived from Flemmi's unlawful
activity then Mr. Carucci is entitled to an acquittal on all
counts.

. . . . .

Counts 70–75 of the indictment contain allegations of acts
by  defendant  Michael  Carucci  and  others  that  constitute
transactions in criminally derived property in violation of
Title 18, United States Code, Section 1957.

Title  18,  Section  1957(a)  of  the  United  States  Code
provides, in pertinent part, that:

Whoever  ...  knowingly  engages  or  attempts  to  engage
in a monetary transaction in criminally derived property
that  is  of  a  value  greater  than  $10,000  and  is  derived
from specified unlawful activity ... shall be guilty of an
offense against the United States.

In order to prove a violation of Title 18, United States Code,
Section  1957,  the  government  must  prove  the  following
three elements beyond a reasonable doubt:

First  Element.  The  defendant  engaged  or  attempted  to
engage in a monetary transaction with a value of more than
$10,000.

Second  Element.  The  defendant  knew  that  the  property
involved  in  the  transaction  had  been  derived  from  some
form of criminal activity.

Third  Element.  The  property  involved  in  the  transaction
was actually derived from specified unlawful activity.

First Eement. To satisfy the first element, the government
must  prove  that  the  defendant  knowingly  engaged  in,  or
attempted to engage in, a monetary transaction involving
property of a value greater than $10,000.

A monetary transaction is the deposit, withdrawal, transfer,
or exchange, in or affecting interstate commerce, of funds
or  a  monetary  instrument  by,  through,  or  to  a  financial
institution.  I  have  previously  defined  for  you  the  terms
“monetary instrument” and “financial institution.”

Thus, the transaction must involve three things:

First, it must be in, or have some minimal relationship to,
interstate commerce.

Second, it must be by, through, or to a financial institution.
For example, drawing a check on a bank account would
satisfy this requirement.

Third, the property involved must have a value greater than
$10,000.

Second  Element.  To  prove  the  second  element,  the
government  must  show  that  the  defendant  knew  that  the
money involved in the transaction was criminally derived
property.

Criminally  derived  property 
includes  any  property
constituting or derived from proceeds of criminal activity.
This means that the property must have been obtained from
some previous, separate criminal action.

The government is only required to show that the defendant
knew  that  the  property  was  derived  from  some  form
of  criminal  activity.  It  does  not  have  to  prove  that  the
defendant  knew  what  particular  type  of  criminal  act
produced the property.

*124   In  order  to  prove  the  element  of  knowledge,  the
government must show that the defendant actually knew
that the property was derived from criminal activity. It is
not sufficient for the government to show that the defendant
might have known or should have known.

In  determining  whether  the  defendant  knew  that  the
property was derived from criminal activity, the jury must
make  a  decision  about  the  defendant's  state  of  mind  at
the time of the transaction. It is impossible to prove this
directly, because the jury cannot look into the defendant's
mind. Therefore, you may rely on circumstantial evidence
in making this determination. You should consider all the
facts  and  circumstances  shown  in  the  evidence  in  order
to  infer  with  a  reasonable  degree  of  accuracy  what  the
defendant's state of mind was.

In deciding whether the defendant acted knowingly, you
may  infer  that  the  defendant  had  knowledge  that  the
property  involved  in  the  transaction  was  derived  from
criminal activity if you find that he deliberately closed his
eyes to the fact that otherwise would have been obvious to

him. It is for the jury to decide whether the defendant was
willfully blind to the fact that the property was criminally
derived and, if so, what inference should be drawn. It is
important, however, to bear in mind that mere negligence
or mistake in failing to learn that the property was derived
from criminal activity is not sufficient.

The government is not required to prove that the defendant
knew  that  the  transaction  involving  criminally  derived
property was itself an illegal act. In other words, although
the  defendant  must  know  that  the  property  was  derived
from criminal acts, the law does not require that he be aware
that the transaction involving that property was a separate
illegal act.

Third Element. To prove the third element of the offense,
the government must show that the property involved in the
transaction  was  actually  derived  from  specified  criminal
activity.

“Specified criminal activity” refers to crimes included in a
list of offenses included in the statute.

I  have  already  instructed  you  on  the  specified  unlawful
activity alleged in the indictment.

It  is  for  the  jury  to  decide  whether  the  government
has  proved  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt  that  the  property
involved in the transaction was actually derived from the
criminal activities just mentioned.

In  proving  the  third  element,  it  is  not  necessary  for  the
government  to  show  that  all  of  the  property  involved  in
the transaction was derived from the criminal activity. The
government can meet its burden of proof even if some of
the involved property was derived from lawful sources and
was commingled with the criminally derived property in
the transaction, so long as the government proves beyond
reasonable  doubt  that  at  least  $10,000  of  each  monetary
transaction was derived from specified unlawful activity.

In  determining  whether  the  property  involved  in  a
transaction  was  derived  from  specified  criminal  activity,
you  may  consider  circumstantial  evidence  insofar  as  it
would  support  common  sense  inferences  based  on  the
realities of human experience.

As already mentioned, the government must prove beyond
a  reasonable  doubt  that  the  defendant  knew  that  the

property  involved  in  the  transaction  was  derived  from
criminal activity.

The government, however, does not need to show that the
defendant  knew  that  the  property  was  derived  from  any
*125  of the offenses that qualify as “specified” criminal
activity. All that is required is knowledge that the property
was produced by some form of unlawful action.

I  am  sending  a  copy  of  the  relevant  portion  of  the
indictment into the jury room for you to have during your
deliberations. You may use it to read the crimes which the
defendant is charged with committing. You are reminded,
however, that an indictment is merely an accusation and is
not to be used by you as any proof of the conduct charged.

(Charge to the Jury, Docket No. 305 at 17, 45–49).

IV. Count 70

Under applicable law, on Count 70 the government's burden
was to prove beyond reasonable doubt each of the following
three elements:

First  Element.  The  defendant  engaged  or  attempted  to
engage in a monetary transaction with a value of more than
$10,000.

Second  Element.  The  defendant  knew  that  the  property
involved  in  the  transaction  had  been  derived  from  some
form of criminal activity.

Third  Element.  The  property  involved  in  the  transaction
was actually derived from specified unlawful activity.

18 U.S.C. § 1957; United States v. Sokolow, 91 F.3d 396, 408

Cir.1995).

was  the  June  4,  1993  transfer,  in  the  amount  of  $35,883,
of  Bank  of  Braintree  check  #  108  (account  #  146400161),

U.S. v. Carucci, 222 F.Supp.2d 117 (2002)

I conclude that under applicable law the defense stated a valid
objection  to  the  submission  of  this  count  to  the  jury.  The
Bank  of  Braintree  check  was  payable  to  a  corporate  entity
(American Equipment Corp.) engaged regularly in receiving
payments  of  amounts  of  $35,000  or  more  for  equipment,
installation,  and  maintenance  for  use  in  laundromats  like
the one operated as Commonwealth Laundries & Cleaners,
Inc., and American Equipment in fact treated it as a routine
and  acceptable  method  of  payment  for  its  furnishing  and
installing for this laundromat a type of upgrading equipment
ordinarily required for equipment of the age of the equipment
found  there  by  American  Equipment's  representatives.  The
government's evidence received at the trial was insufficient
as a matter of law to support a jury finding against defendant
Carucci  on  the  Second  Element  (that  Carucci  knew  that
the  property  involved  in  the  transaction  had  been  derived
from  some  form  of  criminal  activity).  See  United  States  v.
Tramunti,  500  F.2d  1334  (2d  Cir.1974)  (Federal  Rule  of
Criminal Procedure 29 permits judgment of acquittal based
on insufficiency of evidence).

This  outcome  is  the  only  correct  outcome  if  the  “property
involved” is held to be the “money” in the Bank of Braintree
account  and  also  if  the  “property  involved”  is  held  to  be
either the equipment that was upgraded or the equipment that
American  Equipment  supplied  to  effect  the  upgrade.  Thus,
this court erred as a matter of law in submitting Count 70 to
the jury, and the jury verdict cannot have the effect of curing
the court's error of law.

I  take  into  account  also  the  government's  contention  that
evidence received regarding the 1992 transactions involved in
Counts 73–75 served not only as evidence bearing on Counts
73–75 but also as circumstantial evidence bearing on the 1993
transactions  involved  in  Counts  70–72.  The  weight  of  this
evidence  as  it  bears  on  *126   Counts  70–72,  however,  is
very  limited  and  is  not  sufficient,  when  added  to  the  other
evidence  received  in  relation  to  Counts  70–72,  to  provide
adequate support for a finding favorable to the government
on the Second Element of the government's burden on Count
70.  The  banking  transactions  and  properties  involved  in
Counts  73–75  were  exceptional  rather  than  routine.  Those
exceptional  qualities  of  the  1992  transactions  have  little
weight  as  supporting  an  inference  of  knowledge  or  notice
to  defendant  Carucci  that  anything  was  irregular  about  the
1993  transactions  between  Commonwealth  Laundries  and
American Equipment, and I conclude as a matter of law that

adding  this  limited  evidence  to  that  bearing  on  Count  70,
considered  above,  as  a  matter  of  law  does  not  overcome
the  government's  failure  to  meet  its  burden  on  the  Second
Element of Count 70.

For these reasons, the Order below sustains the defendant's
Post–Verdict Motion for Acquittal in Count 70.

V. Count 71

Under applicable law, on Count 71 the government's burden
was to prove beyond reasonable doubt each of the following
three elements:

First  Element.  The  defendant  engaged  or  attempted  to
engage in a monetary transaction with a value of more than
$10,000.

Second  Element.  The  defendant  knew  that  the  property
involved  in  the  transaction  had  been  derived  from  some
form of criminal activity.

Third  Element.  The  property  involved  in  the  transaction
was actually derived from specified unlawful activity.

Charge to the Jury, Part III above, at page 10. See also, e.g.,
18 U.S.C. § 1957; United States v. Sokolow, 91 F.3d 396, 408
(3d Cir.1996); United States v. Gabriele, 63 F.3d 61, 65 (1st
Cir.1995).

The transaction identified in Count 71 of the Indictment was
the  June  11,  1993  transfer,  in  the  amount  of  $15,108.18,
of  Bank  of  Braintree  check  #  110  (account  #  146400161),
payable  to  the  order  of  American  Equipment  Corp.  for
the  purchase  of  laundromat  equipment  by  Commonwealth
Laundries & Cleaners, Inc.

I  conclude  that  under  applicable  law  the  defense  stated  a
valid  objection  to  the  submission  of  this  count  to  the  jury.
The  Bank  of  Braintree  check  was  payable  to  a  corporate
entity  (American  Equipment  Corp.)  engaged  regularly  in
receiving  payments  of  amounts  substantially  larger  than
$15,000  for  equipment,  installation,  and  maintenance  for
use  in  laundromats  like  that  of  Commonwealth  Laundries
&  Cleaners,  Inc.,  and  American  Equipment  in  fact  treated
it  as  a  routine  and  acceptable  method  of  payment  for  its

upgrading equipment ordinarily required for equipment of the
age of the equipment found there by American Equipment's
representatives.  The  government's  evidence  received  at  the
trial  was  insufficient  as  a  matter  of  law  to  support  a  jury
finding  against  defendant  Carucci  on  the  Second  Element
(that  Carucci  knew  that  the  property  involved  in  the
transaction  had  been  derived  from  some  form  of  criminal
activity).

This  outcome  is  the  only  correct  outcome  if  the  “property

account  and  also  if  the  “property  involved”  is  held  to  be
either the equipment that was upgraded or the equipment that
American  Equipment  supplied  to  effect  the  upgrade.  Thus,
this court erred as a matter of law in submitting Count 71 to
the jury, and the jury verdict cannot have the effect of curing
the court's error of law.

I  take  into  account  also  the  government's  contention  that
evidence  received  *127   regarding  the  1992  transactions
involved in Counts 73–75 served not only as evidence bearing
on Counts 73–75 but also as circumstantial evidence bearing
on  the  1993  transactions  involved  in  Counts  70–72.  As
explained  in  Part  IV  above,  however,  the  weight  of  this
evidence as it bears on Counts 70–72 is very limited and is
not sufficient, when added to the other evidence received in
relation to Count 71, to provide adequate support for a finding
favorable to the government on the Second Element of the
government's burden on Count 71.

For these reasons, the Order below sustains the defendant's
Post–Verdict Motion for Acquittal in Count 71.

VI. Count 72

Under applicable law, on Count 72 the government's burden
was to prove beyond reasonable doubt each of the following
three elements:

First  Element.  The  defendant  engaged  or  attempted  to
engage in a monetary transaction with a value of more than
$10,000.

Second  Element.  The  defendant  knew  that  the  property
involved  in  the  transaction  had  been  derived  from  some
form of criminal activity.

Third  Element.  The  property  involved  in  the  transaction
was actually derived from specified unlawful activity.

Charge to the Jury, Part III above, at page 10. See also, e.g.,
18 U.S.C. § 1957; United States v. Sokolow, 91 F.3d 396, 408
(3d Cir.1996); United States v. Gabriele, 63 F.3d 61, 65 (1st
Cir.1995).

The transaction identified in Count 72 of the Indictment was
the June 16, 1993 transfer, in the amount of $27,461, of Bank
of  Braintree  check  #  117  (account  #  146000648),  payable
to the order of American Equipment Corp. for the purchase
of  laundromat  equipment  by  Commonwealth  Laundries  &
Cleaners, Inc.

I conclude that under applicable law the defense stated a valid
objection  to  the  submission  of  this  count  to  the  jury.  The
Bank  of  Braintree  check  was  payable  to  a  corporate  entity
(American Equipment Corp.) engaged regularly in receiving
payments  of  amounts  larger  than  $27,500  for  equipment,
installation, and maintenance for use in laundromats like that
of Commonwealth Laundries & Cleaners, Inc., and American
Equipment  in  fact  treated  it  as  a  routine  and  acceptable
method of payment for its furnishing and installing for this
laundromat a type of upgrading equipment ordinarily required
for  equipment  of  the  age  of  the  equipment  found  there
by American Equipment's representatives. The government's
evidence  received  at  the  trial  was  insufficient  as  a  matter
of  law  to  support  a  jury  finding  against  defendant  Carucci
on the Second Element (that Carucci knew that the property
involved in the transaction had been derived from some form
of criminal activity).

This  outcome  is  the  only  correct  outcome  if  the  “property
involved” is held to be the “money” in the Bank of Braintree
account  and  also  if  the  “property  involved”  is  held  to  be

American  Equipment  supplied  to  effect  the  upgrade.  Thus,
this court erred as a matter of law in submitting Count 72 to

Counts 73–75 served not only as evidence bearing on Counts
73–75 but also as circumstantial evidence bearing on the 1993

transactions  involved  in  Counts  70–72.  The  weight  of  this
evidence as it bears on Counts 70–72, however, is very limited
and is not sufficient, when added to the other  *128  evidence
received in relation to Count 72, to provide adequate support
for  a  finding  favorable  to  the  government  on  the  Second
Element of the government's burden on Count 72.

For these reasons, the Order below sustains the defendant's
Post–Verdict Motion for Acquittal on Count 72.

VII. Count 73

Under applicable law, on Count 73 the government's burden
was to prove beyond reasonable doubt each of the following
three elements:

First  Element.  The  defendant  engaged  or  attempted  to
engage in a monetary transaction with a value of more than
$10,000.

Second  Element.  The  defendant  knew  that  the  property
involved  in  the  transaction  had  been  derived  from  some
form of criminal activity.

Third  Element.  The  property  involved  in  the  transaction
was actually derived from specified unlawful activity.

Charge to the Jury, Part III above, at page 10. See also, e.g.,
18 U.S.C. § 1957; United States v. Sokolow, 91 F.3d 396, 408
(3d Cir.1996); United States v. Gabriele, 63 F.3d 61, 65 (1st
Cir.1995).

[2]
 The transaction identified in Count 73 of the Indictment
was the December 9, 1992 transfer, in the amount of $30,500,
of  Mount  Washington  Bank  check  #  153453,  payable  to
the order of Jeannette Benedetti, Trustee, Comm # 1 Realty
Trust, for purchase of Unit # 1, 362 Commonwealth Avenue,
Boston, Massachusetts.

I  conclude  that  under  applicable  law  the  defense  objection
to  the  submission  of  this  count  to  the  jury  was  properly
overruled. Although the amount gave no notice of potential
irregularity of the transaction, the identification of the account
holder only by a name not generally known to the public or to
persons who were bank employees or were often engaged in
real estate transactions involving units in a condominium, and
identified only as trustee of a Realty Trust apparently created

only for the purchase and holding of one unit in a building
containing condominiums, gave indications of something out
of the ordinary about this transaction.

I  conclude  that  the  admissible  evidence  before  the  jury  in
relation to this count was sufficient to support the verdict on
Count 73.

For these reasons, the Order below denies defendant Carucci's
post-verdict motion for acquittal on Count 73.

VIII. Count 74

Under applicable law, on Count 74 the government's burden
was to prove beyond reasonable doubt each of the following
three elements:

First  Element.  The  defendant  engaged  or  attempted  to
engage in a monetary transaction with a value of more than
$10,000.

Second  Element.  The  defendant  knew  that  the  property
involved  in  the  transaction  had  been  derived  from  some
form of criminal activity.

Third  Element.  The  property  involved  in  the  transaction
was actually derived from specified unlawful activity.

Cir.1995).

[3]
 The transaction identified in Count 74 of the Indictment
was  the  December  9,  1992  transfer,  in  the  amount  of
$16,408.37,  of  Winter  Hill  Federal  Savings  Bank  check  #
449778014, payable to the order of Summers and Summers,
for  purchase  of  Unit  #  1,  362  Commonwealth  Avenue,
Boston, Massachusetts.

a valid objection to the submission of this count to the jury.

to  a  law  firm  engaged  regularly  in  receiving  payments  of
amounts larger than $27,500 for the purchase of real estate

and  Summers  in  fact  treated  it  as  a  routine  and  acceptable
method  of  payment.  The  government's  evidence  received
at  the  trial  was  insufficient  as  a  matter  of  law  to  support
a  jury  finding  against  defendant  Carucci  on  the  Second
Element (that Carucci knew that the property involved in the
transaction  had  been  derived  from  some  form  of  criminal
activity).

This  outcome  is  the  only  correct  outcome  if  the  “property
involved” is held to be the “money” in the Winter Hill Federal
Savings  Bank  account  and  also  if  the  “property  involved”
is held to be either the equipment that was upgraded or the
equipment  that  American  Equipment  supplied  to  effect  the
upgrade. Thus, this court erred as a matter of law in submitting
Count  74  to  the  jury,  and  the  jury  verdict  cannot  have  the
effect of curing the court's error of law.

I  take  into  account  also  the  government's  contention  that
the  fact  that  the  account  was  in  a  Winter  Hill  entity  gave
indications  of  something  out  of  the  ordinary  about  the
transaction. I conclude that the fact that a federally insured
banking institution was located in the same area that Flemmi
and James Bulger operated a criminal enterprise and that the
criminal enterprise coincidentally shared part of its name with
the  banking  institution  does  not  indicate  that  every  or  any
check  drawn  on  that  institution  is  related  to  any  criminal
enterprise or is otherwise out of the ordinary.

For these reasons, the Order below sustains the defendant's
Post–Verdict Motion for Acquittal on Count 74.

IX. Count 75

Under applicable law, on Count 75 the government's burden
was to prove beyond reasonable doubt each of the following
three elements:

First  Element.  The  defendant  engaged  or  attempted  to
engage in a monetary transaction with a value of more than
$10,000.

Second  Element.  The  defendant  knew  that  the  property
involved  in  the  transaction  had  been  derived  from  some
form of criminal activity.

Third  Element.  The  property  involved  in  the  transaction
was actually derived from specified unlawful activity.

Charge to the Jury, Part III above, at page 10. See also, e.g.,
18 U.S.C. § 1957; United States v. Sokolow, 91 F.3d 396, 408
(3d Cir.1996); United States v. Gabriele, 63 F.3d 61, 65 (1st
Cir.1995).

The transaction identified in Count 75 of the Indictment was
the December 9, 1992 transfer, in the amount of $70,000 of
Hyde Park Savings Bank check # 61–074013040, payable to
the order of Jeannette Benedetti, for purchase of Unit # 1, 362
Commonwealth Avenue, Boston, Massachusetts.

I  conclude  that  under  applicable  law  the  defense  objection
to  the  submission  of  this  count  to  the  jury  was  properly
overruled. Although the amount gave no notice of potential
irregularity of the transaction, the identification of the account
holder only by a name not generally known to the public or
to persons who were bank employees or were often engaged
in real estate transactions involving units in a condominium,
and that it was the same name as that involved in Count 72,
gave indications of something out of the ordinary about this
transaction.

*130  I conclude that the admissible evidence before the jury
in relation to this count was sufficient to support the verdict
on Count 75.

For these reasons, the Order below denies defendant Carucci's
post-verdict motion for acquittal on Count 75.

X. The Defense Contention on Concealment

[4]
 In the Charge Conference of April 5, 2002, and again
in  the  defendant  Carucci's  objections  to  the  charge  after  it
was  given  and  before  the  jury  commenced  deliberations,
defendant Carucci objected to the submission of any count
to the jury on grounds of government misconduct. See Part
III–A, above, of this Memorandum. This defense contention
is  that  the  court  should  have  dismissed  the  indictment  and
that, having failed to do so before verdict, the court should
now dismiss all counts on which the jury returned verdicts of
guilty.

Williams, Brooke 6/26/2015
For Educational Use Only

U.S. v. Carucci, 222 F.Supp.2d 117 (2002)

I  find  that  government  misconduct  did  occur,  in  the  form
of  unwarranted  overcharging.  But  in  view  of  the  rulings
made on other aspects of Carucci's post-verdict motions, for
the reasons explained in this Memorandum, I conclude that
dismissal would be an unwarranted sanction, intruding upon
the  public's  interest  in  proceedings  fair  and  appropriate  for
protection of the public's interest as well as the interests of
the United States Attorney and his assistants in prosecution
and the defense interests in fair trial. See, e.g., United States
v.  Font–Ramirez,  944  F.2d  42,  46  (1st  Cir.1991)  (“Even
where misconduct is present, post-conviction dismissal of an
indictment is a rare event ...”).

make  a  conditional  ruling  on  his  motion  for  a  new  trial  in
Docket Number 261 at page 18.

[5]
  Because  I  find,  as  state  in  Part  IX  above,  that
prosecutorial  misconduct  did  occur,  and  that  the  weight
of  the  evidence  does  not  support  the  verdict,  as  I  state  in
Parts  IV,  V,  VI,  and  VIII,  I  conclude  that  if  the  judgment
of acquittal I order below is hereafter vacated or reversed a
new  trial  should  be  granted  for  the  reasons  stated  in  those
parts. See, e.g., United States v. Dixon, 658 F.2d 181, 193 (3d
Cir.1981) (noting that court may grant a  *131  new trial for
prosecutorial misconduct or insufficiency of evidence).

Remaining  for  consideration  is  whether  the  court  should
invoke the lesser sanction of allowing a new trial on Counts
73 and 75, which the defendant has requested under Rule 33
of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. I do not consider
defendant's request for a new trial on Count 74 because I allow
defendant's motion for judgment of acquittal on that count.

Although I reach this conclusion based on the combination
of these two factors, I also conclude that if the judgment of
acquittal I order below is hereafter vacated or reversed a new
trial should be granted based solely on the fact that the verdict
on Counts 70, 71, 72, and 74 is not supported by the weight
of the evidence.

Defendant  Carucci  argues  that  a  new  trial  is  appropriate
because  the  government,  in  its  summation,  “improperly
invited the jury to rely on acquitted conduct.” (Docket No.
287). Specifically, the defendant asserts that the government's
references  in  its  summation  to  the  238  Marlborough  Street
transactions was improper.

I  find  that,  although  the  government  skirted  close  to  the
demarcation  between  propriety  and  impropriety,  it  did  not
cross it, at least in its summation.

Although  a  court  may  order  a  new  trial  on  the  basis  of
prosecutorial  misconduct,  Luttrell  v.  United  States,  320
F.2d 462 (5th Cir.1963), I conclude that the misconduct in
this case in the form of unwarranted overcharging does not
by itself warrant a new trial on Counts 73 and 75.

XI. Conditional Motion for New Trial

Federal  Rule  of  Criminal  Procedure  29(d)  requires  this
court,  if  it  allows  a  motion  for  judgment  of  acquittal,
to  “also  determine  whether  any  motion  for  a  new  trial
should  be  granted  if  the  judgment  of  acquittal  is  thereafter
vacated  or  reversed,  specifying  the  grounds  for  such
determination.” Defendant Carucci requested that the court

For  these  reasons,  the  Order  below  allows  the  defendant
Carucci's conditional motion for a new trial.

ORDER

For the foregoing reasons, it is ORDERED:

(1)  Defendant's  Post–Verdict  Motion  for  Judgment  of
Acquittal (Docket No. 261)

(a) is SUSTAINED as to Counts 70, 71, 72, and 74; and

(b) is DENIED as to Counts 73 and 75.

(2) The defendant Carucci's motion for new trial on Counts
73 and 75 is DENIED.

(3) The defendant Carucci's conditional motion for new trial
on Counts 70, 71, 72, and 74 is ALLOWED.

(4) A Case Management Conference is set for September 5,
2002, at 10:00 a.m. to consider the schedule for a sentencing
hearing and final disposition on Counts 73 and 75.

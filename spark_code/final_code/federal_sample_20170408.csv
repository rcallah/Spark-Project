Delgado's unconsummated “agreement” with a produce broker's agent to commingle marijuana with produce in a motor freight shipment was not an actual agreement as required for the crime of conspiracy: the broker's agent was an undercover government informer, who only pretended to agree to the scheme with Delgado pursuant to ICE officers' plan to incriminate Delgado and seize contraband marijuana. The evidence was also not sufficient to support a finding by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt that Delgado agreed with the unknown person who supplied the marijuana, the unknown prospective recipient, or any other person, to commit a crime that amounted to more than a buyer-seller relationship. The district court did not inform the jury that neither an agreement with a government informer who intends to frustrate the conspiracy, nor a simple buyer-seller relationship, is legally sufficient to amount to a conspiracy. Because there was no evidence that Delgado entered into an agreement with anyone other than the informer to engage in anything beyond a simple buyer-seller transaction, the conspiracy charge must be dismissed due to insufficient evidence."""

Schneider specifically contends that the government engaged in an improper line of questioning of Toni Marquardt, and that

of evidence, Schneider specifically contends that the government failed to timely disclose William Heiden’s perjury before the
federal grand jury, and that the government failed to timely disclose prior trips to Mexico by William Heiden and Gail
Swanson during which drugs were illegally obtained.","alleged withholding
of evidence","Schneider argues that each one of these allegations of prosecutorial
misconduct, individually, is grounds for a new trial, however, he also argues in the alternative that, in the event the court finds
that each of these instances of alleged misconduct, taken individually, do not rise to the level of prejudice that would justify the
granting of a new trial, the cumulative nature of the prosecutor’s conduct would warrant the granting of a new trial.",the cumulative nature of the prosecutor’s conduct would warrant the granting of a new trial.,"Schneider asserts that the prosecutor committed four separate incidents of prosecutorial misconduct. First, Schneider contends
that, on the second day of trial, the prosecutor informed defense counsel that Heiden had admitted to committing perjury before
the federal grand jury in this case.",the prosecutor informed defense counsel that Heiden had admitted to committing perjury,"Second, Schneider
contends that, on the third day of trial, cooperating witness Toni Marquardt was called to the stand, whereupon the prosecutor asked Marquardt if there was any particular reason she was especially nervous.",asked Marquardt if there was any particular reason she was especially nervous.,"Third, Schneider contends that, at the end of the third day of trial, the FBI case

granting a new trial, the court finds that the cumulative nature of the prosecutorial impropriety which permeated this trial does
weigh in favor of granting a new trial. It is noteworthy that the prosecutor’s improper statement regarding the lack of the
defendant’s polygraph, as well as the lack of the defendant’s witnesses’ polygraphs, occurred after the prosecutor had been
previously admonished by the court on three separate occasions regarding previous improper conduct.",improper conduct.,"The court concludes that based upon its review of the evidence, and viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the
government, a reasonable jury could have found Schneider knowingly and voluntarily participated in an agreement to combine,
conspire, and agree with other persons to commit the following two separate offenses:",a reasonable jury could have found Schneider knowingly and voluntarily participated,"However, the
court concludes that the statement *1071 made by the prosecutor during the rebuttal closing argument, alone, as well as the
cumulative effect of the other three instances of imprudent conduct on the part of the prosecutor, so infected the trial with
unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process. Consequently, the verdict in this case is set aside and
Schneider’s motion for new trial is granted.",new trial is granted.,"Therefore, although the evidence against Schneider was considerable, it was
not overwhelming, and coupled with a very strong defense and defense counsel’s forceful closing argument, the court
concludes that Schneider has satisfied this second factor. See Boyle v. Million, 201 F.3d 711, 717–18 (6th Cir.2000) (reversing

Roquel Allen CARTER, Defendant-Appellant. No. 99-5430. | Argued Aug. 1, 2000. | Decided and Filed Jan. 18, 2001. Defendant was convicted in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee, John T. Nixon, J., of armed bank robbery, and he appealed. The Court of Appeals, Moore, Circuit Judge, held that: (1) prosecutor committed plain error in misstating the testimony of key identification witness and by repeatedly insisting that defense counsel was lying about witness's testimony; (2) prosecutor's misconduct affected defendant's substantial rights; and (3) misconduct seriously affected the integrity of judicial proceedings, warranting reversal of conviction and remand for new trial. Reversed and remanded. West Headnotes (14) [1] Criminal Law Particular Statements, Arguments, and Comments Prosecutor committed plain error in misstating the testimony of identification witness by insisting that she did not testify that federal agent told her before she took the witness stand that she had made a mistake in identifying robber, when she had conceded on three separate occasions during trial that agent had told her she made a mistake, just before she gave her trial testimony, and by repeatedly insisting that defense counsel was lying about witness's testimony. 3 Cases that cite this headnote [2] Criminal Law Conduct of Counsel in General In determining when prosecutorial misconduct warrants a new trial, a court must first consider whether the prosecutor's conduct and remarks were improper and, if so, the court must then consider and weigh the following four factors in determining whether the impropriety was flagrant and thus warrants reversal: (1) whether the conduct and remarks of the prosecutor tended to mislead the jury or prejudice the defendant; (2) whether the conduct or remarks were isolated or extensive; (3) whether the remarks were deliberately or accidentally made; and (4) whether the evidence against the defendant was strong. 146 Cases that cite this headnote [3] Criminal Law Arguments and Conduct of Counsel Criminal Law Statements as to Facts, Comments, and Arguments When reviewing challenges to a prosecutor's remarks at trial, Court of Appeals examines the prosecutor's comments within the context of the trial to determine whether such comments amounted to prejudicial error, and in so doing, Court considers whether, and to what extent, the prosecutor's improper remarks were invited by defense counsel's argument. 42 Cases that cite this headnote [4] Criminal Law Arguments and Conduct in General Prosecutorial misconduct may so exceptionally flagrant that it constitutes plain error, and is grounds for reversal even if the defendant did not object to it. be 14 Cases that cite this headnote [5] Criminal Law Necessity of Objections in General 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Prosecutor's plain error in misrepresenting critical evidence during rebuttal argument, with no opportunity for an argumentative response, and in making personal attacks on opposing counsel that may have affected the jury's view of counsel's entire defense, seriously affected the integrity of judicial proceedings, warranting reversal of conviction and remand for new trial.

A jury found Defendant Appellant, Roquel Allen Carter, guilty of armed bank robbery in violation of 18 U.S.C. 2113(d). The district court denied Carter's motions for judgment of acquittal and a new trial and sentenced him to eighty-four months of imprisonment, followed by five years of supervised release. Although Carter now appeals his conviction on four grounds, we focus primarily on his claim that the prosecution deprived him of his right to due process and a fair trial under the Fifth Amendment when the prosecutor committed prosecutorial misconduct during closing arguments by misstating material evidence and accusing defense counsel of lying. Because we believe that the prosecutor committed misconduct that was sufficient to constitute plain error warranting reversal, we REVERSE the judgment of the district court and REMAND for a new trial. 2015 Thomson Reuters.

BACKGROUND On October 15, 1996, the Community First Bank of Hartsville, Tennessee (hereinafter Hartsville Bank or the bank ), opened at 8:30 a.m., with four bank tellers, including Terri Lynn Halliburton, working at its customer windows. Sheila Cornwell was the bank's first customer. While pulling away from a carwash bay across the street before entering the bank, Cornwell saw a black male standing next to a big green older model car. Joint Appendix ( J.A. ) at 153. Cornwell testified that this man was wearing coveralls and appeared to be about five seven, slender build .... [with] his hair .... braided with sprigs, spriggly braided hair sticking up about an inch maybe, half inch to an inch. J.A. at 153-54. While teller Halliburton was assisting the second customer Kenneth Keller with his bank deposit, she noticed a black man in coveralls enter the bank and approach the desk. Shortly after Keller had arrived, Dwight Holder entered the bank and noticed the man in coveralls, who by then was approaching Halliburton's window. Holder described the man as a black man who was wearing brown coveralls ... or tan-looking color coveralls .... a baseball cap and pretty new looking boots and who was between 5-10 and six foot tall. J.A. at 322-23, 326, 343. When the man in coveralls finally reached Halliburton's window, he handed her a note that said a 100 and a 50 and a 20 ; the other side of the note said You will be dead! J.A. at 416. Halliburton realized that she was the victim of a robbery and looked to Holder as if to say Help me, Dwight. J.A. at 417. Holder testified that he saw the hesitancy in Halliburton's face and looked at the man, at which point the man showed him what appeared to be the butt of a gun. In response to the note from the man in coveralls, Halliburton gave the man a hundred-dollar bill, a fifty-dollar bill, and a twenty-dollar bill, to which the man responded Give it all to me. I have a gun. J.A. at 417. While reaching for more money, Halliburton pulled the bait money, setting off the silent alarm, but accidentally making a gong noise to the middle drawer. J.A. at 418. The robber then took the $170 on the counter and walked out the front door. After the robber exited, Holder stated aloud, You have been robbed.... Call the police. J.A. at 330-31. Holder then proceeded out the front door and saw an older type car, [with] kind of a darkish green color and an Indiana tag pull away. J.A. at 331-32. As Holder watched the car pull away, he screamed for someone to write the car's license plate numbers as he called them out; the numbers he called were either 988831 or 988861. J.A. at 331, 342-43. Meanwhile, Keller was driving on Highway 25 to return to his restaurant. While on the road, Keller observed a black male *780 recklessly driving a big green car with an Indiana tag. When Keller arrived at his restaurant, he called 911 and reported the car to the police. By then, the police had arrived at the bank, spoken to witnesses, and put out a broadcast of the vehicle description over the radio, a Be on the Lookout ( BOLO ). After hearing the BOLO, Officer Jerry Hickman of the Gallatin Police Department contacted Chief Hank Scruggs of the Hartsville Police Department and told the Chief that he thought he had run a check on the tag number of a car that fit the BOLO description just the night before. Officer Hickman had a practice of running checks on cars with out-of-state tags in the Lackey Circle area, which is a government housing project, to see if they were stolen. Officer Hickman testified that, in the early morning hours of October 15, 1996, he ran a check on an out-of state car that he saw with Indiana tag 99S6881 in the Lackey Circle area. This check revealed that the car was not stolen but showed no other information, as Officer Hickman was unable to process out-of-state tags fully. After speaking with the Chief, Officer Hickman asked Detective Stanley Hilgadick of the Gallatin Police Department to try to locate the car in the Lackey Circle area. Detective Hilgadick did not locate the car in the area but heard from several people in the neighborhood that Roquel Halcomb drove the car. Because Detective Hilgadick had known Barbara Halcomb, Carter's aunt, for several years, he went to her home to ask her if she knew Roquel Halcomb. Ms. Halcomb informed the Detective that Carter was the person who owned the car in question. The prosecution also contends that, during her interview on October 17, 1996, Ms. Halcomb viewed a videotape taken at a Citgo station in Hartsville, Tennessee, on October 15, 1996, and identified Carter as an individual walking past the cashier in the videotape. J.A. at 186-87, 193-94. Ms. Halcomb, 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 4 \f U.S. v. Carter, 236 F.3d 777 (2001) 2001 Fed.App. 0020P however, testified that she did not identify Carter in the videotape. J.A. at 183-84. On cross-examination, defense counsel elicited further information from Officer Russ Pulley about Ms. Halcomb's alleged identification of Carter in the videotape. Officer Pulley's testimony revealed that, contrary to a frequently used police procedure, Ms. Halcomb did not sign or affirm any written statement to indicate that such an identification had been made. With the information Detective Hilgadick received from Ms. Halcomb, the Gallatin Police Department issued a BOLO, which listed information about Carter, including his height, weight, and address in Gallatin, as well as the names of his family members in Indianapolis, Indiana. The BOLO also stated that Carter was a suspect in two robberies and a shooting and had failed to appear for a warrant against him in Indianapolis. Further into their investigation, the police received more information from Kathleen Ford, an employee at the Citgo gas station in Hartsville, who claimed to have seen a suspicious looking black man at the Citgo station on the morning of the robbery. Specifically, Ford told the Chief that, early in the morning on October 15, 1996, she had seen a black man between five feet, three inches and six feet tall and with curly hair, come into the market; go to the men's room where he stayed for fifteen to twenty minutes; leave the store without purchasing anything; get into an old model, green car; and begin to dress in gold coveralls. Recordings from a surveillance camera in the Citgo market corroborated Ford's testimony, showing a black man, who was wearing a dark- colored jacket with letters on its front, enter and leave the Citgo market as described. A check with the Indiana authorities revealed that the green car with license number 99S6881 was registered to Rose Colwell from Indianapolis, who testified at trial to selling her car to Rock Carter on August 29, 1996. J.A. at 97. She also testified that she let Rock Carter borrow her tags while he repaired the car, and *781 that he promised to bring the tags back but never did. On October 17, 1996, Sergeant James Lanier was patrolling near White House, Tennessee, and saw a black male driving a green car that matched the description of a BOLO he received in connection with a robbery. Sergeant Lanier testified that he ran the tag number of a car, which was Indiana tag 99S6881; followed the car; and later approached the driver at a gas station. The man, however, fled from Lanier and successfully escaped in his green car. At trial, Sergeant Lanier identified Carter as the man he had chased in White House. On the night of the chase, however, Sergeant Lanier identified Terry Johnson, not Carter, as the man who had fled from him. Sergeant Lanier had identified Johnson from a photograph that was provided to him by the authorities in Simpson County, Kentucky after he had called in to report his chase in White House. J.A. at 634, 643. Additionally, Sergeant Lanier's written report of the chase failed to mention that he had observed an Indiana license plate or a license number and did not identify 99S68881 as an observed license number. J.A. at 637-38. On October 18, 1996, after receiving a suspicious person call from the Best Western Hotel in Riverside, Alabama, Officer Rick Oliver went to the hotel where he found a young black man asleep in a green car. After some conversation with the young man, Officer Oliver began a pat-down for weapons. In the middle of the pat-down, however, the man fled with his gun-initially on foot and then eventually in a stolen pick-up truck. At trial, Officer Oliver identified Carter as the man he had stopped in Riverside. He also testified that the jacket Carter was wearing at the time of his arrest was the same jacket that Officer Oliver saw on the man he pursued in Riverside. Carter was later arrested in Lincoln, Alabama, where he was forced outside a barn by police with tear gas. After Carter's arrest, Officer Oliver inventoried the green car that was abandoned in the hotel parking lot in Riverside. In so doing, he found a number of items, including (1) an Indiana license plate reading 99S6881; (2) receipts in Carter's name from a Firestone tire service center in Indianapolis, Indiana; (3) receipts dated October 8, 1996, from Wal-mart and R.H. Music Store in Gallatin, Tennessee, which appear to corroborate the testimony from Anita Duncan, Carter's first cousin, who testified that Carter was driving the green Chrysler at that time in 1996; and (4) a receipt dated October 18, 1996, from Mapco Express in Cornersville, Tennessee, which is south of Gallatin and north of Lincoln, Alabama, where Carter was eventually arrested. Carter's trial commenced in federal district court on December 8, 1998. One of the Government's key witnesses at trial was Halliburton, the teller who had been robbed at her bank window on October 15, 1996. In her direct examination, 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 5 \f U.S. v. Carter, 236 F.3d 777 (2001) 2001 Fed.App. 0020P Halliburton identified Carter as the man who robbed the bank. During cross-examination, however, Halliburton stated that just two days after the robbery, she saw a Channel 4 TV news clip on a robbery suspect that showed a picture of Terry Johnson 1 but identified the pictured suspect as Roquel Carter. She then called Chief Scruggs to tell him that she just saw a picture of the man who robbed the bank. Prior to seeing the TV news clip, Halliburton had not looked at and was not asked to view a photograph spread of potential suspects. In fact, Halliburton was not asked to look at a photograph spread of suspects until September of 1998, nearly two years *782 after the robbery and just a few months before trial. When she was finally asked to view a photograph spread, Halliburton declined to look at any pictures because she knew the trial was coming up and [she] just didn't feel comfortable ... looking at a whole bunch of pictures and because she didn't want to look at anything else that might confuse [her]. J.A. at 75, 427. Additionally, at trial Halliburton explained that when she arrived to testify at Carter's trial, she still believed she was going to identify the person she saw in the TV news clip as the robber. She further testified that she changed her testimony only after Agent Whitten, who was sitting at the prosecution's table during trial, told her it was the right name, Roquel Carter, but the wrong face on the TV news clip. 2 J.A. at 88. After defense counsel finished his closing argument, in which he pointed out the changes Halliburton made in her identification testimony, the prosecutor began his rebuttal argument. The beginning of the prosecutor's rebuttal argument was as follows: MR. KENNEDY: Ladies and gentlemen, I am going to submit to you to-will try to yell and scream I submit to you, you have heard one tremendous colossal lie. Terri Lynn Halliburton Presley testified she did-remember what she said [?] She did not say, You have got the right guy but the wrong face. And she never said anybody for the Government told her that. Remember what her answer was, she said, I was told to give an honest answer. The only person who has ever said she said that is Doug Thoresen [defense counsel]. She never said that. That is a lie, a bold fabrication. She said, I was told that the man in the picture is not Roquel Carter. She didn't say, I was told you have got the wrong guy . On that question, she answered, I was told to be honest. * * * * * * And it is an absolutely whole lie that she was told that she had the wrong guy on the bank robbery. She was told to give her honest answer, period. Don't let them sneak that one over on you. Evaluate the case, evaluate what it is, do your job. But don't let that curve sneak across the plate. It's a lie. J.A. at 560-61 (emphasis added). Defense counsel never objected during the prosecutor's rebuttal argument. Once closing arguments concluded, the district court gave its general charge to the jury, and the jury began deliberations. On the morning of December 16, 1998, the second day of deliberations, the jury sent the district court a message, asking whether it could base its verdict upon circumstantial evidence without basing it upon eyewitness identification. J.A. at 593. The district court then responded by providing the following instruction: you can base a verdict upon circumstantial evidence but only if that circumstantial evidence convinces you beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant is guilty of the crime charged in the Indictment. J.A. at 594-95. About an hour later, the jury came back with a guilty verdict. Defense counsel immediately asked the district court to poll the jury to ask if its members discounted eyewitness testimony and based their verdict on circumstantial evidence. The district court did not poll the jury, instead asking the foreperson if some jurors based their verdict only on circumstantial evidence and if some were satisfied with the eyewitness identifications. The foreperson responded in the affirmative, and all the jurors agreed. II. ANALYSIS [1] Although Carter raises four grounds for appeal in his brief, we focus on *783 only his prosecutorial misconduct claim regarding the prosecutor's comments during closing arguments, as we find such conduct to be reversible error. 3 Carter argues that his conviction should be reversed and that this case should be remanded for a new trial because the prosecutor committed flagrant misconduct during closing arguments. Specifically, Carter contends that the prosecutor misstated the testimony of Halliburton when the prosecutor insisted that Halliburton did not testify that Agent Whitten 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 6 \f U.S. v. Carter, 236 F.3d 777 (2001) 2001 Fed.App. 0020P told her it was the right name ... but the wrong face before she took the witness stand. J.A. at 88. Carter further argues that the prosecutor misled the jury by repeatedly insisting that defense counsel was lying about Halliburton's testimony. For the reasons stated below, we agree that such conduct constituted plain error sufficient to warrant a reversal of Carter's conviction and to remand for a new trial. [2] The Sixth Circuit has adopted a two-step approach for determining when prosecutorial misconduct warrants a new trial. See United States v. Carroll, 26 F.3d 1380, 1385-87 (6th Cir.1994). Under this approach, a court must first consider whether the prosecutor's conduct and remarks were improper. Id. at 1387; see also Boyle v. Million, 201 F.3d 711, 717 (6th Cir.2000). If the remarks were improper, the court must then consider and weigh four factors in determining whether the impropriety was flagrant and thus warrants reversal. These four factors are as follows: (1) whether the conduct and remarks of the prosecutor tended to mislead the jury or prejudice the defendant; (2) whether the conduct or remarks were isolated or extensive; (3) whether the remarks were deliberately or accidentally made; and (4) whether the evidence against the defendant was strong. Carroll, 26 F.3d at 1385; see also Boyle, 201 F.3d at 717; United States v. Collins, 78 F.3d 1021, 1039 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 872, 117 S.Ct. 189, 136 L.Ed.2d 127 (1996). [3] When reviewing challenges to a prosecutor's remarks at trial, we examine the prosecutor's comments within the context of the trial to determine whether such comments amounted to prejudicial error. United States v. Young, 470 U.S. 1, 11-12, 105 S.Ct. 1038, 84 L.Ed.2d 1 (1985); Collins, 78 F.3d at 1040. In so doing, we consider whether, and to what extent, the prosecutor's improper remarks were invited by defense counsel's argument. Young, 470 U.S. at 12, 105 S.Ct. 1038; Collins, 78 F.3d at 1040. [5] In this case, because defense counsel made no [4] objection to the prosecutor's statements at trial, this court will review for plain error only. Collins, 78 F.3d at 1039. As this court has previously recognized, prosecutorial misconduct may be so exceptionally flagrant that it constitutes plain error, and is grounds for reversal even if the defendant did not object to it. Carroll, 26 F.3d at 1385 n. 6. In United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993), the Supreme Court set forth three factors a defendant must prove to obtain relief under a plain error analysis. First, the defendant must show that there was an error. Id. at 732-33, 113 S.Ct. 1770. Error is defined as [d]eviation from a legal rule ... unless the rule has been waived, and waiver is defined as the intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right. Id. at 733, 113 S.Ct. 1770 (quoting Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458, 464, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 82 L.Ed. 1461 (1938)). Second, the defendant must show that the error was plain or obvious under current *784 law. Id. at 734, 113 S.Ct. 1770. Finally, the defendant must establish that the plain error affected his substantial rights. This means that the error must have been prejudicial: It must have affected the outcome of the district court proceedings. Id. If these requirements are satisfied, then the court of appeals should exercise its discretion to remedy the error if the error seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings. Id. at 736, 113 S.Ct. 1770 (quotation omitted). The Supreme Court and this court have subsequently clarified that the Olano test involves four steps. See Johnson v. United States, 520 U.S. 461, 466-67, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997) ( [B]efore an appellate court can correct an error not raised at trial, there must be (1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affect[s] substantial rights. If all three conditions are met, an appellate court may then exercise its discretion to notice a forfeited error, but only if (4) the error seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. ) (quotations omitted); United States v. Monus, 128 F.3d 376, 386 (6th Cir.1998). Carroll provides, as noted above, four specific factors to consider in evaluating whether a prosecutor's improper conduct or remarks warrant reversal. A. Error/Plain Error [6] We conclude that the prosecutor's conduct during closing arguments not only constituted error but also was plain error. The law is clear that, while counsel has the freedom at trial to argue reasonable inferences from the evidence, counsel cannot misstate evidence or make personal attacks on opposing counsel. See Young, 470 U.S. at 9 & n. 7, 105 S.Ct. 1038; Collins, 78 F.3d at 1040. In this case, the prosecutor committed both of these prohibited acts. First, although the prosecutor correctly stated that Halliburton testified she was told to be honest, he incorrectly stated that Halliburton did not admit to being told she had made a mistake in identifying the robber at the bank. In actuality, Halliburton had conceded on three separate occasions during trial that Agent Whitten had told her, just before she gave 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 7 \f U.S. v. Carter, 236 F.3d 777 (2001) 2001 Fed.App. 0020P her trial testimony, that she had made a mistake in her identification of the robber. For example, the trial transcript reads: Q: You were the witness to the bank robbery, is that correct? A: That's correct. Q: And he [Agent Whitten] told you that you had made a mistake, is that right? A: Yes, sir. Q: And you accepted that? A: Yes, sir. * * * * * * Q: You changed your mind about identifying the person [who] robbed the Hartsville bank that you had previously identified after Agent Whitten on the morning ... this trial was supposed to start told you that you had made a mistake in identifying the person? A: That's correct. Q: And when you knew or came into this room after not having seen the photo spread, you knew that Roquel Carter would be in this room? A: Yes, sir. J.A. at 79-80 (emphasis added). The transcript further reads: Q: When you came here from Hartsville on Tuesday, December 8th to testify, you still thought you were going to identify the person who is in these videos [including the TV news clip showing Terry Johnson's picture], isn't that true, as the man [who] robbed you? A: Yes, sir. Q: What made you change your mind? * * * * * * A. It was Tuesday morning. They told me there had been a change and they had told me that the person [whom] I had identified on Channel 4 News was not-his name was not Roquel Carter. *785 Q: Who told you that? A: [Agent] Whitten. J.A. at 77, 79 (emphasis added). The transcript also reads: Q: .... You testified a moment ago about a mistake. What type of mistake were you told had occurred? A: I was told that it was the right name, Roquel Carter, but the wrong face. That was the mistake that I was told they had made on the news. J.A. at 88 (emphasis added). In sum, the prosecutor clearly misrepresented material evidence when he asserted that Halliburton had not been told it was the right name ... but the wrong face before she took the witness stand and that [t]he only person who has ever said that is Doug Thoresen [defense counsel]. J.A. at 560. Given that this court has recognized that it is improper for attorneys, especially prosecutors who generally have the confidence of juries, to misstate evidence, we conclude that the prosecutor's misstatement of the evidence in this case, specifically of Halliburton's testimony, was not only error but also was plain error. See Washington v. Hofbauer, 228 F.3d 689, 700 (6th Cir.2000) (citing Donnelly v. DeChristoforo, 416 U.S. 637, 646, 94 S.Ct. 1868, 40 L.Ed.2d 431 (1974)); see also Davis v. Zant, 36 F.3d 1538, 1548 n. 15 (11th Cir.1994) ( It is a fundamental tenet of the law that attorneys may not make material misstatements of fact in summation. ). Cf. A.B.A., ABA Standards for Criminal Justice Prosecution Function and Defense Function 3-5.8(a) (3d ed. 1993) ( The prosecutor should not intentionally misstate the evidence or mislead the jury as to the inferences it may draw. ). Additionally, because this court, along with the Supreme Court, has repeatedly noted that it is improper for counsel to make personal attacks on an opposing advocate, we also conclude that the prosecutor's claims that defense counsel was lying were not only error but also were plain error. 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 8 \f U.S. v. Carter, 236 F.3d 777 (2001) 2001 Fed.App. 0020P Young, 470 U.S. at 9, 105 S.Ct. 1038; Collins, 78 F.3d at 1040. As the trial transcript reveals, the prosecutor personally attacked defense counsel's truthfulness four times during his rebuttal argument by asserting that defense counsel was lying about Halliburton's testimony and trying to sneak ... one over on [the jury]. J.A. at 561. Specifically, the prosecutor asserted that defense counsel's characterization of Halliburton's testimony was one tremendous colossal lie, a lie, a bold fabrication, an absolutely whole lie, and just plain a lie. J.A. at 560-61. In sum, because Carter has successfully shown that the prosecutor committed clear error under current law by misrepresenting material evidence and accusing defense counsel of lying, we conclude that Carter has satisfied both the first and second requirements for relief under a plain error analysis. B. Whether The Misconduct Substantially Affected Carter's Rights and Warrants Reversal [7] We also conclude, based upon our analysis of the prosecutor's misconduct under the four factors of the Carroll test, that the prosecutor's actions affected Carter's substantial rights and warrant reversal. 1. Whether The Prosecutor's Comments Were Likely To Prejudice Carter The first required factor of the Carroll test is that the prosecutor's comments were likely to mislead and prejudice the jury. We believe that Carter has shown that the prosecutor's misstatement of Halliburton's testimony and personal attacks on defense counsel's truthfulness were likely to mislead the jury and cause prejudice to Carter. regarding Halliburton's At the outset, we note our belief that the prosecutor's misstatement testimony was inherently prejudicial to Carter. This court has consistently recognized that a prosecutor's misrepresentation of material evidence can have a significant impact on jury deliberations because a jury generally has confidence that a prosecuting attorney is faithfully *786 observing his obligation as a representative of a sovereignty. Washington, 228 F.3d at 700; see also United States v. Solivan, 937 F.2d 1146, 1150 (6th Cir.1991) (Because jurors are likely to place great confidence in the faithful execution of the obligations of a prosecuting attorney, improper insinuations or suggestions [by the prosecutor] are apt to carry [great] weight against a defendant and therefore are more likely to mislead a jury.); United States v. Smith, 500 F.2d 293, 295 (6th Cir.1974). 4 More importantly, the prosecutor's misrepresentation in this case held an even greater potential for misleading the jury because the misstated evidence, Halliburton's testimony, was central to the Government's case. Because Halliburton was the only person who was at the bank during the robbery to identify Carter as the robber, her identification testimony was of critical importance to the prosecution. Defense counsel recognized the significance of Halliburton's testimony and raised several significant and relevant issues for the jury to consider during his cross-examination of Halliburton. Specifically, he raised important questions regarding the propriety of Agent Whitten's telling Halliburton that it was the right name, Roquel Carter, but the wrong face just prior to Halliburton's taking the witness stand. As defense counsel's cross-examination of Halliburton revealed, Halliburton did not even know the name of the man shown on the Channel 4 TV news clip until a few days before trial and did not recall telling the police the name of the man on the clip when she identified him as the robber nearly two years before. Therefore, defense counsel highlighted serious questions regarding whether the name of the man in the clip even mattered to Halliburton before she testified. Additionally, defense counsel's cross-examination of Halliburton revealed that Halliburton had no intention to change her previous identification of Johnson until after Agent Whitten told her she had made a mistake, that Halliburton knew Carter was sitting at the defense table before she took the witness stand, and that Carter was the only black person in the courtroom at the time Halliburton testified. In other words, defense counsel pointed out critical problems concerning the reliability of Halliburton's in-court identification and important issues concerning possible attempts by the prosecution to influence Halliburton's testimony before she took the witness stand. 5 The prosecutor, however, tainted the jury's ability to weigh Halliburton's averments of honesty during her in- court identification of Carter against these suspicious circumstances when he repeatedly asserted that defense counsel was lying and mistakenly claimed that Halliburton did not admit to being told she had made a mistake in her initial identification. With these actions, the prosecutor may very well have caused the jurors, some of whom relied on Halliburton's in-court identification of Carter in 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 9 \f U.S. v. Carter, 236 F.3d 777 (2001) 2001 Fed.App. 0020P making their decision to *787 convict, to question whether they remembered Halliburton's testimony correctly. He also may have further caused these jurors to question other arguments presented by defense counsel who was portrayed by the prosecutor as lying. In sum, the prosecutor adversely influenced the jury's ability to assess Halliburton's credibility and to evaluate her in-court identification of Carter as the robber, in contrast to her previous identification of Terry Johnson as the robber. Such prejudice, however, could have been cured, [9] [8] or at least minimized, by curative instructions to the jury. Consequently, we must now determine whether any prejudice caused by the prosecutor's misconduct was cured by instructions given to the jury. Carroll, 26 F.3d at 1385 ( The first factor [whether the remarks tended to mislead the jury or to prejudice the defendant] includes consideration of whether the trial judge gave an appropriate cautionary instruction to the jury. ). Ordinarily, a court should not overturn a criminal conviction on the basis of a prosecutor's comments alone, especially where the district court has given the jury an instruction that may cure the error. See Young, 470 U.S. at 11-13, 105 S.Ct. 1038; United States v. Cobleigh, 75 F.3d 242, 247 (6th Cir.1996). As a general matter, juries are presumed to understand and follow directions from the court. United States v. Forrest, 17 F.3d 916, 920-21 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 511 U.S. 1113, 114 S.Ct. 2115, 128 L.Ed.2d 673 (1994). [10] In this case, although we believe that the district court could have given an instruction that neutralized the error, we do not believe that any of the jury instructions given at this trial sufficiently cured the prejudice caused by the prosecutor's actions. We note that defense counsel did not request any curative instruction. The only possibly relevant instruction given by the district court was an instruction that objections or arguments made by the lawyers are not evidence in the case. J.A. at 574. This instruction, however, was made along with all other routine instructions for evaluating the evidence presented at trial. Furthermore, the instruction was not given at the time of the improper comments. Instead, it was given only after closing arguments had been completed and, even then, after a fifteen-minute recess. Therefore, there was nothing directly linking this jury instruction to the prosecutor's misconduct. See Lent v. Wells, 861 F.2d 972, 977 (6th Cir.1988), cert. denied, 489 U.S. 1100, 109 S.Ct. 1577, 103 L.Ed.2d 943 (1989) (trial judge's instructions did not cure the error caused by the misconduct because [n]o curative instructions were given at the time of defense's objections and the judge did not mention the prosecutor's improper comments during his general charge to the jury); see also Smith, 500 F.2d at 298 (cautionary instruction did not neutralize the prejudice of comments that called attention to the defendants' failure to testify because it failed expressly to instruct the jury that no adverse inference could be drawn from [the defendants'] silence ). Cf. United States v. Cruz-Padilla, 227 F.3d 1064, 1069 (8th Cir.2000) (prejudice caused by prosecutorial misconduct during closing argument was not cured because the district court issued no curative instructions where the defense failed to object to the misconduct). We believe that measures more substantial than a general instruction that objections or arguments made by the lawyers are not evidence in the case were needed to cure the prejudicial effect of the prosecutor's comments during closing arguments. 6 As the Ninth Circuit stated in United States v. Kerr, it is very doubtful that the generalized observations of the court really conveyed a sufficient sense of judicial approval of both *788 content and circumstances needed to dispell [sic] the harm in the core of the prosecutor's statements. 981 F.2d 1050, 1053 (9th Cir.1992) (quotation omitted). In conclusion, in light of the suspect circumstances surrounding Halliburton's in- court identification and the fact that no curative instructions were given shortly after the prosecutor's improper comments during closing arguments, we conclude that the prosecutor's misconduct significantly impacted the jury's ability to assess Halliburton's testimony. 2. Whether The Prosecutor's Comments Were Isolated Or Extensive The second required factor under the Carroll test is that the improper comments must be more than mere isolated remarks, incapable of infecting the entire trial. If a prosecutor's comments were simply isolated remarks made during the course of a long trial, then the error caused by such misconduct may be harmless. United States v. Leon, 534 F.2d 667, 679 (6th Cir.1976). After considering the prosecutor's improper comments within the context of the entire trial, we conclude that such comments were not merely harmless, isolated comments but instead were prejudicial statements that infected the entire trial. The prosecutor's improper comments occurred during his rebuttal 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 10 \f U.S. v. Carter, 236 F.3d 777 (2001) 2001 Fed.App. 0020P argument and therefore were the last words from an attorney that were heard by the jury before deliberations. Given the critical nature of Halliburton's testimony, the weaknesses in some of the circumstantial evidence presented at trial, see infra, and the lasting impression that certainly remained with the jury after the prosecutor's rebuttal argument, we cannot state that the prosecutor's conduct did not shake our faith in the jury's verdict. Moreover, we do not believe that the fact the prosecutor made these improper comments only during closing arguments alters the extent of the prejudice caused by them. 7 As we have previously acknowledged, even a single misstep on the part *789 of the prosecutor may be so destructive of the right of the defendant to a fair trial that reversal must follow. Smith, 500 F.2d at 297 (quoting Pierce v. United States, 86 F.2d 949, 952 (6th Cir.1936)). [11] We also do not believe that the prosecutor's comments were an invited response to defense counsel's statements during closing argument. 8 Instead, we see defense counsel's arguments as a restatement *790 of Halliburton's explanation of how she came to identify Carter, instead of Johnson, as the robber, and the reasons why defense counsel believed such changes and explanations lacked credibility, i.e. Halliburton's changes reflected her desire to please the prosecution. In other words, we view defense counsel's closing argument as simply a legitimate attempt to cast doubt on the credibility of a witness who, for two years, had held the belief that Terry Johnson, the man she had confidently identified as the robber only two days after the robbery, 9 was the man who robbed Hartsville Bank on October 15, 1996, and who changed her identification testimony only after a federal agent informed her that it was the right name ... but the wrong face on the TV news clip. J.A. at 88. Finally, we do not believe that the prejudicial effects of the prosecutor's improper comments were any less extensive because the prosecutor later told the jury that it could question the credibility of Halliburton. The prosecutor stated: I don't know what more I can say to that. You may question [Halliburton] for sure.... [Seeing] her live and in person look at ... Carter, look at these pictures, and tell you what her honest answer is to the best of her ability, as you watched her go through the thought process for the very first time, and answer the questions. That is to your benefit as judges of the facts of this case. J.A. at 561. [12] As we previously noted in this opinion, juries are apt to place great confidence in the statements of prosecutors, and we do not believe that this brief statement by the prosecutor was sufficient to overcome the prejudice caused by his repeated insistence that defense counsel was lying and that Halliburton had not admitted to being told she had made a mistake. 3. Whether The Comments Were Deliberately Or Accidentally Placed Before The Jury The third required factor under the Carroll test is that the improper comments be deliberately placed before the jury. After careful review, we conclude that the prosecutor knowingly and deliberately made his improper comments before the jury. In Young, the Supreme Court explained that the proper course of action for an attorney who takes issue with comments made by opposing counsel is for that attorney to object to the offensive comments, not to respond with equally offensive comments. Young, 470 U.S. at 13, 105 S.Ct. 1038 (noting that the prosecutor at the close of defense summation should have objected to the defense counsel's improper statements with a request that the court give a *791 timely warning and curative instruction to the jury ). In this case, the prosecutor did not object to what he believed was a mischaracterization of Halliburton's testimony by defense counsel, nor did he attempt to refute defense counsel's closing argument by pointing to contradictory evidence presented at trial. Instead, the prosecutor repeatedly claimed that defense counsel, a man whom, as the prosecutor noted during appellate oral argument, he had known for many years and whom he held in high regard, was telling a colossal lie. In other words, rather than properly object to what he believed were improper statements made by defense counsel, the prosecutor simply committed another clear wrong and thereby eliminated any possibility that the district court could correct defense counsel's wrongs with a curative instruction. When such action is viewed in light of 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 11 \f U.S. v. Carter, 236 F.3d 777 (2001) 2001 Fed.App. 0020P the prosecutor's familiarity with defense counsel, it must be considered deliberate and calculated. Indeed, the very repetition with which the prosecutor stated that defense counsel had lied, in and of itself, reveals that such comments were not accidentally placed before the jury. See United States v. Smith, 962 F.2d 923, 935 (9th Cir.1992) ( The repeated comments also demonstrate that the errors were not inadvertent; clearly, we are not dealing with a spontaneous comment that could be regretted but not retracted. ). Consequently, we conclude that Carter has also satisfied the third factor of the Carroll test. 4. Strength Of The Evidence The fourth and final required factor under the Carroll test is that the strength of the evidence against the defendant not be overwhelming. We conclude that, while there arguably was sufficient circumstantial evidence presented at trial to support the jury's guilty verdict, 10 this evidence was not so strong as to overcome the improper and inflammatory comments made by the prosecutor. Although numerous pieces of circumstantial evidence presented at trial seem to suggest that Carter may have robbed the Hartsville Bank, we do not consider the cumulative weight of this evidence to be overwhelming, especially in the light of the evidence suggesting that Terry Johnson may have been the robber, not Carter. For example, evidence at trial revealed that both Halliburton, the teller who was robbed at the bank, and Sergeant Lanier, who chased a suspect matching a BOLO for Carter two days after the robbery, initially identified Terry Johnson as the robbery suspect. Additionally, evidence at trial revealed that Terry Johnson had escaped from a prison, *792 where he was serving time for a conviction of robbery and carjacking, on October 1, 1996, and that Terry Johnson was arrested in Lebanon, a town near Gallatin and Hartsville, Tennessee, just two days after the Hartsville Bank robbery. Evidence also showed that Terry Johnson and Carter both had their hair in braids during the relevant period. [13] In addition to the evidence indicating that Johnson may have been the robber, there also are some weaknesses in the other evidence presented against Carter. For instance, even assuming that it was Carter, and not Johnson, who fled from Officer Oliver and Sergeant Lanier, the negative inference which can be drawn from this evidence is weakened by the fact that Carter may have had another reason to flee from officers: his failure to appear for a warrant against him in Indianapolis. 11 Therefore, it is possible that Carter was fleeing because of his warrant in Indiana when he fled from both Sergeant Lanier and Officer Oliver, and not because he committed the bank robbery in Hartsville. Additionally, Sergeant Lanier's testimony regarding the chase is weakened by the fact that his written report failed to mention that he observed an Indiana license plate and did not identify 99S68881 as an observed license number. Furthermore, at trial many of the witnesses providing circumstantial evidence against Carter, including Holder, Ford, and Cornwell, could not identify Carter as the man they saw on the day of the robbery. Finally, although the police claim that Ms. Halcomb, Carter's aunt, identified him as the person Ms. Ford described in the Citgo station on October 15, 1996, the evidence shows that, contrary to a frequently used police procedure, Ms. Halcomb did not sign or affirm any written statement verifying this identification. In sum, in light of the evidence suggesting that Johnson perhaps may have been the Hartsville Bank robber and the problems with some of the other evidence presented against Carter, we conclude that Carter has also satisfied the fourth and final factor of the Carroll test and thus has shown the prejudice required for relief under a plain error analysis. See, e.g., Kerr, 981 F.2d at 1054 (reversing on ground of prosecutorial misconduct where the testimony of the four vouched witnesses was crucial to the government's case and the prosecutor's argument and [o]nly indirect evidence connected [the defendant] to the [crime] ). Cf. Boyle, 201 F.3d at 717-18 (reversing for prosecutorial misconduct even though the evidence against the defendant was strong); United States v. Francis, 170 F.3d 546, 552 (6th Cir.1999) (same). *793 [14] As our final step, we conclude that the error here was of a magnitude seriously to affect the fairness and integrity of judicial proceedings. As noted above, the prosecutor in this case failed to honor his obligation as a representative of the sovereign when he misrepresented critical evidence at the close of trial with no opportunity for an argumentative response and when he made personal attacks on opposing counsel that may have affected the jury's view of counsel's entire defense. To hold that such action does not seriously affect the integrity of judicial proceedings would be tantamount to excusing the prosecutor's deliberate disregard of his duty to uphold the Government's interest in ensuring 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Berger, 295 U.S. at 88, 55 S.Ct. 629. III. CONCLUSION In conclusion, Carter has successfully established that the prosecutor committed misconduct sufficient to warrant reversal under a plain error analysis. Carter has demonstrated that the prosecutor committed clear and obvious error by misstating material evidence at trial and improperly accusing defense counsel of lying. Carter has also shown that such misconduct affected the outcome of the trial. Specifically, Carter has shown that the prosecutor's improper comments were highly likely to mislead the jury, that the effect of the comments was considerable, that the prosecutor deliberately made the improper comments to the jury, and that the strength of the evidence against him was not so overwhelming that it negated the improper comments made by the prosecutor. In sum, because we believe that allowing a conviction to stand here where the prosecutor affected Carter's substantial rights by clearly misstating a key witness's testimony and repeatedly asserting that defense counsel lied during closing arguments would pose a clear threat to the integrity of judicial proceedings, we REVERSE the district court's judgment in this case and REMAND for a new trial. Parallel Citations 2001 Fed.App. 0020P Footnotes * 1 2 3 4 5 6 The Honorable Denise Page Hood, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Michigan, sitting by designation. Terry Johnson was arrested on October 18, 1996, in Lebanon, Tennessee, which is near both Gallatin and Hartsville, Tennessee. He had escaped from Simpson County Jail on October 1, 1996, where he was serving time for carjacking and robbery. At the time of his arrest, Johnson had braids in his hair. As noted above, Sergeant Lanier also initially identified Terry Johnson as the man who eluded his capture. The TV news clip on Channel 4 was based upon an interview with Sergeant Lanier that occurred after Lanier had unsuccessfully chased the suspect in White House, Tennessee. Halliburton's interview with Agent Whitten on December 8, 1998 took place in the presence of the prosecutor in this case. J.A. at 51. We note, however, that our analysis of Carter's prosecutorial misconduct claim indirectly involves an analysis of Carter's remaining arguments, which are (1) that there was insufficient evidence from which a jury could constitutionally find Carter guilty; (2) that the district court abused its discretion in giving a flight instruction in its charge to the jury; and (3) that the district court abused its discretion by denying both his motion for a mistrial and his motion to strike the entire jury panel on the ground of prosecutorial misconduct during voir dire. As the Supreme Court stated in Berger v. United States: The United States Attorney is the representative not of an ordinary party to a controversy, but of a sovereignty whose obligation to govern impartially is as compelling as its obligation to govern at all; and whose interest, therefore, in a criminal prosecution is not that it shall win a case, but that justice shall be done. As such, he is in a peculiar and very definite sense the servant of the law, the twofold aim of which is that guilt shall not escape or innocence suffer. He may prosecute with earnestness and vigor-indeed, he should do so. But, while he may strike hard blows, he is not at liberty to strike foul ones. It is as much his duty to refrain from improper methods calculated to produce a wrongful conviction as it is to use every legitimate means to bring about a just one. Berger, 295 U.S. 78, 88, 55 S.Ct. 629, 79 L.Ed. 1314 (1935). Other evidence that tends to weaken Halliburton's testimony includes the fact that Halliburton was first asked to view a photograph spread of potential suspects in September of 1998, nearly two years after her initial identification and just a few months before the trial. Furthermore, the only other black person who had even been in the courtroom during Carter's trial was a woman, and she [was] part of the court personnel. J.A. at 76. While we do not rule that it was error for the district court not to instruct the jury sua sponte of the impropriety of the prosecutor's comments, we note our belief that the district court should have done so or at the very least, should have called a sidebar conference with the lawyers. See Young, 470 U.S. at 10, 105 S.Ct. 1038 ( The judge must meet situations as they arise and [be able] to cope with ... the contingencies inherent in the adversary process. ) (quotation omitted, 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 13 \f U.S. v. Carter, 236 F.3d 777 (2001) 2001 Fed.App. 0020P 7 alteration in original). A trial judge should be alert to deviations from proper argument and take prompt corrective action as appropriate. Kerr, 981 F.2d at 1054. In fact, the prosecutor made improper comments at another time during the judicial proceedings. As Carter argues in his brief, the prosecutor also made improper comments during voir dire. The events occurred as follows. The prosecutor first questioned the jury panel: Q: Anybody here ever been down to-not down to, but spent a lot of time in, grew up in, worked in, got relatives, close friends in Talladega, Alabama? Pell City? All right. Ms. Qualls. Wow, I didn't think I would ring a bell on that one. A: I have a good friend who lives in Talladega, Alabama. But I haven't seen him in a long time. Q: Well, let me put it this way, have you had any occasions to hear about-this is 1996 now-anybody, any friends down there who work in law enforcement? A: No. Q: Had any occasion to hear about a shoot-out with police back in October of 1996, down there? Does that ring a bell? A: No. J.A. at 294. Following this line of questioning, defense counsel asked to approach the bench with government counsel, moved for a mistrial, and moved to strike the entire panel on the ground that the prosecutor's questioning was prejudicial because Carter was not charged with a shoot-out in this case. J.A. at 295. The district court denied the motion but instructed the prosecutor not to make a reference to a shoot-out or anything else that may have happened. J.A. at 295. Not satisfied with the court's decision, defense counsel reiterated his objection to the prosecutor's line of questioning, stating that he felt the jury panel was affected by the questioning and that its members now knew that this Defendant has been charged in a shoot-out. J.A. at 296. In response, the district court noted defense counsel's concerns but pointed out that the jury panel did not know Carter had been charged with a shoot-out but had simply heard something about a shoot-out. J.A. at 296. The court then overruled defense counsel's motion. At conclusion of the side-bar, the prosecutor proceeded to question the jury panel about connections to Talladega County, Alabama. What is interesting about the prosecutor's questions, however, is that, just immediately after the court pointed out that the panel was not aware of Carter's charge in a shoot-out, the prosecutor, although not directly mentioning or asking anything about Carter's involvement in the shoot-out, asked a question which clearly implied Carter's involvement in a shoot-out in Talladega County. Government counsel asked, And my question would be, is there anything that you might have heard that might conceivably be connected with this case? J.A. at 296-97 (emphasis added). When viewed in the context of the prosecutor's prior questions during voir dire, this question seems to hint indirectly to the jury that Carter was indeed involved in a shoot-out in Talladega County. Thus, the question potentially may have prejudiced the jury panel against Carter. In sum, as the district court recognized, the prosecutor made improper comments during voir dire by making a reference to a shoot-out. In addition to this comment, the prosecutor also arguably made another improper comment when he asked a question that implied Carter was indeed involved in a shoot-out. 8 In his closing argument, defense counsel stated: MR. THORESEN: The next false trail is this picture. This picture which was broadcast on the night of October 17 by two media stations. And Terri Halliburton saw this some two days after the robbery when her memory was fresh, when the details of this were fresh-not two years later. And she identified this man [Johnson] as being the person who robbed her. That is a false trail. Since when is it a false trail for a witness to a crime to make an identification of a [perpetrator]? This [Johnson] is who[m] she identified. The name Roquel Carter was used and so the Government assumed-the Government assumed that the picture shown on Channel 4 and the picture shown on Channel 2 was really Roquel Carter. And that assumption stayed there with the Government for two years. And when Terri Halliburton got her subpoena to testify in this case, she still had identified the person who robbed this bank as [Johnson]. And when she came to Nashville, what happened? Was the respect, given these circumstances, by letting her determine whether or not she had made a mistake, whether or not this was, in fact, the person who robbed the bank? Was there a line-up conducted? Did anyone say, Gosh, we need to get this rectified, we need to see really what is going on here. Instead of that happening, what happened was the statement was made, You got the right name, but the wrong face. You got the right name, and the wrong face. And that comes from-that comes not from [Halliburton's] 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 14 \f U.S. v. Carter, 236 F.3d 777 (2001) 2001 Fed.App. 0020P mouth, not from the crime victim, not from the person who saw what had happened; it came from the Government's mouth. And from that moment on, I tell you, that her testimony was poisoned. She knew that the Government did not think this was the person who robbed her.... [This affects] the validity of the identification made by the witness. It affects the identification, the reliability, whether it's correct or not, whether you can rely upon it, whether you can go home with the same degree of certainty that you would apply to your ordinary affairs to make important decisions, to rest easily as to a reasonable doubt, that this was the person who robbed the bank. Instead of some Government agent saying, You got the right name but the wrong face. And isn't that a false trail? Isn't [that] a huge false trail? And after that, knowing that that was their opinion, letting this witness come in here and see the only black man in this room, knowing that that is the person who the Government thought was going to be the person, and make an identification. That seems really strange to me. And it seems really strange that Officer Lanier would do the same thing. I don't know about lightning striking once, but I know lightning struck twice here; it struck twice in the form of Terri Halliburton and struck twice in the same place-in the same place with respect to the testimony of Officer Lanier.... It struck with both of these witnesses saying, within two days of this robbery occurring, that [Johnson] is the man. * * * * * * And before [Halliburton] was told this, there was one person [whom] she had identified as being the bank robber, and it wasn't Roquel Carter; it was this man [Johnson]. And interestingly, that is what Officer Lanier had done. * * * * * * And I have a great deal of difficulty in believing [that an accused person will be treated fairly in court] when a witness is told that you have got the right name but the wrong face before the witness hits the courtroom, before the witness has an opportunity of seeing the person, that that is fair. * * * * * * There are a lot of false trails here. And these false trails are a result of the Government's behavior of what they have specifically done in telling witnesses things and not telling them things, and not proving this case. It's the result of a closed mind, that was closed at ten o'clock on the morning of October 15 of 1996, before this investigation ever got started. J.A. at 548-51, 558-59 (emphasis added). 9 Halliburton testified that she told the police she was certain of her identification when she initially identified Terry Johnson as the robber. The relevant portions of the trial transcript read: Q: .... Ms. King of our office interviewed you, is that right? A: That's correct. * * * * * * Q: And you told Ms. King you were certain [that Terry Johnson, the man you saw on the TV news clip, was the robber] when she interviewed you? A: Yes. Q: And you told Agent Whitten you were certain [of the same thing] when he interviewed you in November of 1996 a short time after the bank robbery, is that right? A: Yes, sir. J.A. at 72-73. 10 When considering the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, a reasonable juror could conclude that (1) Ms. Colwell sold Carter the green Chrysler that was recovered by Officer Oliver; (2) Carter was the man Ms. Ford saw enter the Hartsville Citgo station and change into coveralls shortly before the bank robbery; (3) Carter was the man whom Ms. Cornwell saw at the carwash before the bank robbery; (4) Carter's green car was the same car that Mr. Holder saw the robber drive away in after the robbery; (5) it was Carter who fled from both Officer Oliver and Sergeant Lanier; and (6) Carter fled because he knew he committed the robbery at the Hartsville Bank. In sum, a rational fact finder could decide that Carter was the man who robbed Hartsville Bank on October 15, 1996. See, e.g., United States v. Bond, 22 F.3d 662, 667 (6th Cir.1994) (holding that there was sufficient evidence for a robbery conviction where the getaway car, a red Firebird, was identified by an individual who followed the vehicle and wrote down the license plate; the Firebird had been stolen from a gas station in a nearby city several weeks earlier; the Firebird had a defendant's fingerprints both on its inside and outside on the driver's side; a friend of one defendant testified that he had seen him driving a red Firebird 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 15 \f U.S. v. Carter, 236 F.3d 777 (2001) 2001 Fed.App. 0020P two or three weeks before the robbery; a music tape reported missing by the owner of the Firebird was found in one defendant's house; ammunition for handguns, a spent shotgun shell, and stacks of cash sorted by denomination were found in one defendant's house; a friend testified that the defendants confided in him about the robbery; and an FBI agent testified that he overheard the defendants talking about killing a person who planned to testify against them). The district court included the following instruction on flight in its charge to the jury: 11 INSTRUCTION: Flight. You have received evidence that after the crime was supposed to have been committed, the Defendant, Roquel Allen Carter, fled. If you believe from the evidence that the Defendant did indeed flee, then you may consider this conduct, along with all the other evidence, in deciding whether the Government has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that he committed the crime charged. This conduct may indicate that he thought he was guilty and was trying to avoid punishment. On the other hand, sometimes an innocent person may flee to avoid being arrested, or for some other innocent reason. J.A. at 577. In light of Sergeant Lanier's and Officer Hickman's testimony at trial, we do not believe it was an abuse of discretion for the district court to give this flight instruction. Additionally, we do not believe that the flight instruction violated Carter's right not to testify or incriminate himself. This instruction, which comes from the Sixth Circuit Pattern Jury Instructions, does not appear to suggest guilt on the part of Carter because of his decision not to testify or explain incidents of flight. See Committee on Pattern Criminal Jury Instructions, Pattern Criminal Jury Instructions 7.14 (1991 ed.). Rather, the instruction states that evidence of flight may or may not indicate a defendant's guilty conscience or intent to avoid punishment. See Illinois v. Wardlow, 528 U.S. 119, 123-27, 120 S.Ct. 673, 676-77, 145 L.Ed.2d 570 (2000) (noting that although flight may be indicative of ongoing criminal activity, there are also innocent reasons for flight from police).

Roquel Allen CARTER, Defendant-Appellant. No. 99-5430. | Argued Aug. 1, 2000. | Decided and Filed Jan. 18, 2001. Defendant was convicted in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee, John T. Nixon, J., of armed bank robbery, and he appealed. The Court of Appeals, Moore, Circuit Judge, held that: (1) prosecutor committed plain error in misstating the testimony of key identification witness and by repeatedly insisting that defense counsel was lying about witness's testimony; (2) prosecutor's misconduct affected defendant's substantial rights; and (3) misconduct seriously affected the integrity of judicial proceedings, warranting reversal of conviction and remand for new trial. Reversed and remanded.

Carter, 236 F.3d 777 (2001) 2001 Fed.App. 0020P two days after the robbery, and the reasons why defense counsel believed such changes and explanations lacked credibility, and reflected her desire to please the prosecution, were a legitimate attempt to cast doubt on the credibility of the witness and did not invite prosecutor's rebuttal misstating the evidence and accusing defense counsel of lying. Prosecutor's plain error in misrepresenting critical evidence during rebuttal argument, with no opportunity for an argumentative response, and in making personal attacks on opposing counsel that may have affected the jury's view of counsel's entire defense, seriously affected the integrity of judicial proceedings, warranting reversal of conviction and remand for new trial.

The district court denied Carter's motions for judgment of acquittal and a new trial and sentenced him to eighty-four months of imprisonment, followed by five years of supervised release. Although Carter now appeals his conviction on four grounds, we focus primarily on his claim that the prosecution deprived him of his right to due process and a fair trial under the Fifth Amendment when the prosecutor committed prosecutorial misconduct during closing arguments by misstating material evidence and accusing defense counsel of lying. Because we believe that the prosecutor committed misconduct that was sufficient to constitute plain error warranting reversal, we REVERSE the judgment of the district court and REMAND for a new trial. 2015 Thomson Reuters.

BACKGROUND On October 15, 1996, the Community First Bank of Hartsville, Tennessee (hereinafter Hartsville Bank or the bank ), opened at 8:30 a.m., with four bank tellers, including Terri Lynn Halliburton, working at its customer windows. Sheila Cornwell was the bank's first customer. While pulling away from a carwash bay across the street before entering the bank, Cornwell saw a black male standing next to a big green older model car. Joint Appendix ( J.A. ) at 153. Cornwell testified that this man was wearing coveralls and appeared to be about five seven, slender build .... [with] his hair .... braided with sprigs, spriggly braided hair sticking up about an inch maybe, half inch to an inch. J.A. at 153-54. While teller Halliburton was assisting the second customer Kenneth Keller with his bank deposit, she noticed a black man in coveralls enter the bank and approach the desk. Shortly after Keller had arrived, Dwight Holder entered the bank and noticed the man in coveralls, who by then was approaching Halliburton's window. Holder described the man as a black man who was wearing brown coveralls ... or tan-looking color coveralls .... a baseball cap and pretty new looking boots and who was between 5-10 and six foot tall. J.A. at 322-23, 326, 343. When the man in coveralls finally reached Halliburton's window, he handed her a note that said a 100 and a 50 and a 20 ; the other side of the note said You will be dead! J.A. at 416. Halliburton realized that she was the victim of a robbery and looked to Holder as if to say Help me, Dwight. J.A. at 417. Holder testified that he saw the hesitancy in Halliburton's face and looked at the man, at which point the man showed him what appeared to be the butt of a gun. In response to the note from the man in coveralls, Halliburton gave the man a hundred-dollar bill, a fifty-dollar bill, and a twenty-dollar bill, to which the man responded Give it all to me. I have a gun. J.A. at 417. While reaching for more money, Halliburton pulled the bait money, setting off the silent alarm, but accidentally making a gong noise to the middle drawer. J.A. at 418. The robber then took the $170 on the counter and walked out the front door. After the robber exited, Holder stated aloud, You have been robbed.... Call the police. J.A. at 330-31. Holder then proceeded out the front door and saw an older type car, [with] kind of a darkish green color and an Indiana tag pull away. J.A. at 331-32. As Holder watched the car pull away, he screamed for someone to write the car's license plate numbers as he called them out; the numbers he called were either 988831 or 988861. J.A. at 331, 342-43. Meanwhile, Keller was driving on Highway 25 to return to his restaurant. While on the road, Keller observed a black male *780 recklessly driving a big green car with an Indiana tag. When Keller arrived at his restaurant, he called 911 and reported the car to the police. By then, the police had arrived at the bank, spoken to witnesses, and put out a broadcast of the vehicle description over the radio, a Be on the Lookout ( BOLO ). After hearing the BOLO, Officer Jerry Hickman of the Gallatin Police Department contacted Chief Hank Scruggs of the Hartsville Police Department and told the Chief that he thought he had run a check on the tag number of a car that fit the BOLO description just the night before. Officer Hickman had a practice of running checks on cars with out-of-state tags in the Lackey Circle area, which is a government housing project, to see if they were stolen. Officer Hickman testified that, in the early morning hours of October 15, 1996, he ran a check on an out-of state car that he saw with Indiana tag 99S6881 in the Lackey Circle area. This check revealed that the car was not stolen but showed no other information, as Officer Hickman was unable to process out-of-state tags fully. After speaking with the Chief, Officer Hickman asked Detective Stanley Hilgadick of the Gallatin Police Department to try to locate the car in the Lackey Circle area. Detective Hilgadick did not locate the car in the area but heard from several people in the neighborhood that Roquel Halcomb drove the car. Because Detective Hilgadick had known Barbara Halcomb, Carter's aunt, for several years, he went to her home to ask her if she knew Roquel Halcomb. Ms. Halcomb informed the Detective that Carter was the person who owned the car in question. The prosecution also contends that, during her interview on October 17, 1996, Ms. Halcomb viewed a videotape taken at a Citgo station in Hartsville, Tennessee, on October 15, 1996, and identified Carter as an individual walking past the cashier in the videotape. J.A. at 186-87, 193-94. Ms. Halcomb, 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 4 \f U.S. v. Carter, 236 F.3d 777 (2001) 2001 Fed.App. 0020P however, testified that she did not identify Carter in the videotape. J.A. at 183-84. On cross-examination, defense counsel elicited further information from Officer Russ Pulley about Ms. Halcomb's alleged identification of Carter in the videotape. Officer Pulley's testimony revealed that, contrary to a frequently used police procedure, Ms. Halcomb did not sign or affirm any written statement to indicate that such an identification had been made. With the information Detective Hilgadick received from Ms. Halcomb, the Gallatin Police Department issued a BOLO, which listed information about Carter, including his height, weight, and address in Gallatin, as well as the names of his family members in Indianapolis, Indiana. The BOLO also stated that Carter was a suspect in two robberies and a shooting and had failed to appear for a warrant against him in Indianapolis. Further into their investigation, the police received more information from Kathleen Ford, an employee at the Citgo gas station in Hartsville, who claimed to have seen a suspicious looking black man at the Citgo station on the morning of the robbery. Specifically, Ford told the Chief that, early in the morning on October 15, 1996, she had seen a black man between five feet, three inches and six feet tall and with curly hair, come into the market; go to the men's room where he stayed for fifteen to twenty minutes; leave the store without purchasing anything; get into an old model, green car; and begin to dress in gold coveralls. Recordings from a surveillance camera in the Citgo market corroborated Ford's testimony, showing a black man, who was wearing a dark- colored jacket with letters on its front, enter and leave the Citgo market as described. A check with the Indiana authorities revealed that the green car with license number 99S6881 was registered to Rose Colwell from Indianapolis, who testified at trial to selling her car to Rock Carter on August 29, 1996. J.A. at 97. She also testified that she let Rock Carter borrow her tags while he repaired the car, and *781 that he promised to bring the tags back but never did. On October 17, 1996, Sergeant James Lanier was patrolling near White House, Tennessee, and saw a black male driving a green car that matched the description of a BOLO he received in connection with a robbery. Sergeant Lanier testified that he ran the tag number of a car, which was Indiana tag 99S6881; followed the car; and later approached the driver at a gas station. The man, however, fled from Lanier and successfully escaped in his green car. At trial, Sergeant Lanier identified Carter as the man he had chased in White House. On the night of the chase, however, Sergeant Lanier identified Terry Johnson, not Carter, as the man who had fled from him. Sergeant Lanier had identified Johnson from a photograph that was provided to him by the authorities in Simpson County, Kentucky after he had called in to report his chase in White House. J.A. at 634, 643. Additionally, Sergeant Lanier's written report of the chase failed to mention that he had observed an Indiana license plate or a license number and did not identify 99S68881 as an observed license number. J.A. at 637-38. On October 18, 1996, after receiving a suspicious person call from the Best Western Hotel in Riverside, Alabama, Officer Rick Oliver went to the hotel where he found a young black man asleep in a green car. After some conversation with the young man, Officer Oliver began a pat-down for weapons. In the middle of the pat-down, however, the man fled with his gun-initially on foot and then eventually in a stolen pick-up truck. At trial, Officer Oliver identified Carter as the man he had stopped in Riverside. He also testified that the jacket Carter was wearing at the time of his arrest was the same jacket that Officer Oliver saw on the man he pursued in Riverside. Carter was later arrested in Lincoln, Alabama, where he was forced outside a barn by police with tear gas. After Carter's arrest, Officer Oliver inventoried the green car that was abandoned in the hotel parking lot in Riverside. In so doing, he found a number of items, including (1) an Indiana license plate reading 99S6881; (2) receipts in Carter's name from a Firestone tire service center in Indianapolis, Indiana; (3) receipts dated October 8, 1996, from Wal-mart and R.H. Music Store in Gallatin, Tennessee, which appear to corroborate the testimony from Anita Duncan, Carter's first cousin, who testified that Carter was driving the green Chrysler at that time in 1996; and (4) a receipt dated October 18, 1996, from Mapco Express in Cornersville, Tennessee, which is south of Gallatin and north of Lincoln, Alabama, where Carter was eventually arrested. Carter's trial commenced in federal district court on December 8, 1998. One of the Government's key witnesses at trial was Halliburton, the teller who had been robbed at her bank window on October 15, 1996. In her direct examination, 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 5 \f U.S. v. Carter, 236 F.3d 777 (2001) 2001 Fed.App. 0020P Halliburton identified Carter as the man who robbed the bank. During cross-examination, however, Halliburton stated that just two days after the robbery, she saw a Channel 4 TV news clip on a robbery suspect that showed a picture of Terry Johnson 1 but identified the pictured suspect as Roquel Carter. She then called Chief Scruggs to tell him that she just saw a picture of the man who robbed the bank. Prior to seeing the TV news clip, Halliburton had not looked at and was not asked to view a photograph spread of potential suspects. In fact, Halliburton was not asked to look at a photograph spread of suspects until September of 1998, nearly two years *782 after the robbery and just a few months before trial. When she was finally asked to view a photograph spread, Halliburton declined to look at any pictures because she knew the trial was coming up and [she] just didn't feel comfortable ... looking at a whole bunch of pictures and because she didn't want to look at anything else that might confuse [her]. J.A. at 75, 427. Additionally, at trial Halliburton explained that when she arrived to testify at Carter's trial, she still believed she was going to identify the person she saw in the TV news clip as the robber. She further testified that she changed her testimony only after Agent Whitten, who was sitting at the prosecution's table during trial, told her it was the right name, Roquel Carter, but the wrong face on the TV news clip. 2 J.A. at 88. After defense counsel finished his closing argument, in which he pointed out the changes Halliburton made in her identification testimony, the prosecutor began his rebuttal argument. The beginning of the prosecutor's rebuttal argument was as follows: MR. KENNEDY: Ladies and gentlemen, I am going to submit to you to-will try to yell and scream I submit to you, you have heard one tremendous colossal lie. Terri Lynn Halliburton Presley testified she did-remember what she said [?] She did not say, You have got the right guy but the wrong face. And she never said anybody for the Government told her that. Remember what her answer was, she said, I was told to give an honest answer. The only person who has ever said she said that is Doug Thoresen [defense counsel]. She never said that. That is a lie, a bold fabrication. She said, I was told that the man in the picture is not Roquel Carter. She didn't say, I was told you have got the wrong guy . On that question, she answered, I was told to be honest. * * * * * * And it is an absolutely whole lie that she was told that she had the wrong guy on the bank robbery. She was told to give her honest answer, period. Don't let them sneak that one over on you. Evaluate the case, evaluate what it is, do your job. But don't let that curve sneak across the plate. It's a lie. J.A. at 560-61 (emphasis added). Defense counsel never objected during the prosecutor's rebuttal argument. Once closing arguments concluded, the district court gave its general charge to the jury, and the jury began deliberations. On the morning of December 16, 1998, the second day of deliberations, the jury sent the district court a message, asking whether it could base its verdict upon circumstantial evidence without basing it upon eyewitness identification. J.A. at 593. The district court then responded by providing the following instruction: you can base a verdict upon circumstantial evidence but only if that circumstantial evidence convinces you beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant is guilty of the crime charged in the Indictment. J.A. at 594-95. About an hour later, the jury came back with a guilty verdict. Defense counsel immediately asked the district court to poll the jury to ask if its members discounted eyewitness testimony and based their verdict on circumstantial evidence. The district court did not poll the jury, instead asking the foreperson if some jurors based their verdict only on circumstantial evidence and if some were satisfied with the eyewitness identifications. The foreperson responded in the affirmative, and all the jurors agreed. II. ANALYSIS [1] Although Carter raises four grounds for appeal in his brief, we focus on *783 only his prosecutorial misconduct claim regarding the prosecutor's comments during closing arguments, as we find such conduct to be reversible error. 3 Carter argues that his conviction should be reversed and that this case should be remanded for a new trial because the prosecutor committed flagrant misconduct during closing arguments. Specifically, Carter contends that the prosecutor misstated the testimony of Halliburton when the prosecutor insisted that Halliburton did not testify that Agent Whitten 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 6 \f U.S. v. Carter, 236 F.3d 777 (2001) 2001 Fed.App. 0020P told her it was the right name ... but the wrong face before she took the witness stand. J.A. at 88. Carter further argues that the prosecutor misled the jury by repeatedly insisting that defense counsel was lying about Halliburton's testimony. For the reasons stated below, we agree that such conduct constituted plain error sufficient to warrant a reversal of Carter's conviction and to remand for a new trial. [2] The Sixth Circuit has adopted a two-step approach for determining when prosecutorial misconduct warrants a new trial. See United States v. Carroll, 26 F.3d 1380, 1385-87 (6th Cir.1994). Under this approach, a court must first consider whether the prosecutor's conduct and remarks were improper. Id. at 1387; see also Boyle v. Million, 201 F.3d 711, 717 (6th Cir.2000). If the remarks were improper, the court must then consider and weigh four factors in determining whether the impropriety was flagrant and thus warrants reversal. These four factors are as follows: (1) whether the conduct and remarks of the prosecutor tended to mislead the jury or prejudice the defendant; (2) whether the conduct or remarks were isolated or extensive; (3) whether the remarks were deliberately or accidentally made; and (4) whether the evidence against the defendant was strong. Carroll, 26 F.3d at 1385; see also Boyle, 201 F.3d at 717; United States v. Collins, 78 F.3d 1021, 1039 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 872, 117 S.Ct. 189, 136 L.Ed.2d 127 (1996). [3] When reviewing challenges to a prosecutor's remarks at trial, we examine the prosecutor's comments within the context of the trial to determine whether such comments amounted to prejudicial error. United States v. Young, 470 U.S. 1, 11-12, 105 S.Ct. 1038, 84 L.Ed.2d 1 (1985); Collins, 78 F.3d at 1040. In so doing, we consider whether, and to what extent, the prosecutor's improper remarks were invited by defense counsel's argument. Young, 470 U.S. at 12, 105 S.Ct. 1038; Collins, 78 F.3d at 1040. [5] In this case, because defense counsel made no [4] objection to the prosecutor's statements at trial, this court will review for plain error only. Collins, 78 F.3d at 1039. As this court has previously recognized, prosecutorial misconduct may be so exceptionally flagrant that it constitutes plain error, and is grounds for reversal even if the defendant did not object to it. Carroll, 26 F.3d at 1385 n. 6. In United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993), the Supreme Court set forth three factors a defendant must prove to obtain relief under a plain error analysis. First, the defendant must show that there was an error. Id. at 732-33, 113 S.Ct. 1770. Error is defined as [d]eviation from a legal rule ... unless the rule has been waived, and waiver is defined as the intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right. Id. at 733, 113 S.Ct. 1770 (quoting Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458, 464, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 82 L.Ed. 1461 (1938)). Second, the defendant must show that the error was plain or obvious under current *784 law. Id. at 734, 113 S.Ct. 1770. Finally, the defendant must establish that the plain error affected his substantial rights. This means that the error must have been prejudicial: It must have affected the outcome of the district court proceedings. Id. If these requirements are satisfied, then the court of appeals should exercise its discretion to remedy the error if the error seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings. Id. at 736, 113 S.Ct. 1770 (quotation omitted). The Supreme Court and this court have subsequently clarified that the Olano test involves four steps. See Johnson v. United States, 520 U.S. 461, 466-67, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997) ( [B]efore an appellate court can correct an error not raised at trial, there must be (1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affect[s] substantial rights. If all three conditions are met, an appellate court may then exercise its discretion to notice a forfeited error, but only if (4) the error seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. ) (quotations omitted); United States v. Monus, 128 F.3d 376, 386 (6th Cir.1998). Carroll provides, as noted above, four specific factors to consider in evaluating whether a prosecutor's improper conduct or remarks warrant reversal. A. Error/Plain Error [6] We conclude that the prosecutor's conduct during closing arguments not only constituted error but also was plain error. The law is clear that, while counsel has the freedom at trial to argue reasonable inferences from the evidence, counsel cannot misstate evidence or make personal attacks on opposing counsel. See Young, 470 U.S. at 9 & n. 7, 105 S.Ct. 1038; Collins, 78 F.3d at 1040. In this case, the prosecutor committed both of these prohibited acts. First, although the prosecutor correctly stated that Halliburton testified she was told to be honest, he incorrectly stated that Halliburton did not admit to being told she had made a mistake in identifying the robber at the bank. In actuality, Halliburton had conceded on three separate occasions during trial that Agent Whitten had told her, just before she gave 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 7 \f U.S. v. Carter, 236 F.3d 777 (2001) 2001 Fed.App. 0020P her trial testimony, that she had made a mistake in her identification of the robber. For example, the trial transcript reads: Q: You were the witness to the bank robbery, is that correct? A: That's correct. Q: And he [Agent Whitten] told you that you had made a mistake, is that right? A: Yes, sir. Q: And you accepted that? A: Yes, sir. * * * * * * Q: You changed your mind about identifying the person [who] robbed the Hartsville bank that you had previously identified after Agent Whitten on the morning ... this trial was supposed to start told you that you had made a mistake in identifying the person? A: That's correct. Q: And when you knew or came into this room after not having seen the photo spread, you knew that Roquel Carter would be in this room? A: Yes, sir. J.A. at 79-80 (emphasis added). The transcript further reads: Q: When you came here from Hartsville on Tuesday, December 8th to testify, you still thought you were going to identify the person who is in these videos [including the TV news clip showing Terry Johnson's picture], isn't that true, as the man [who] robbed you? A: Yes, sir. Q: What made you change your mind? * * * * * * A. It was Tuesday morning. They told me there had been a change and they had told me that the person [whom] I had identified on Channel 4 News was not-his name was not Roquel Carter. *785 Q: Who told you that? A: [Agent] Whitten. J.A. at 77, 79 (emphasis added). The transcript also reads: Q: .... You testified a moment ago about a mistake. What type of mistake were you told had occurred? A: I was told that it was the right name, Roquel Carter, but the wrong face. That was the mistake that I was told they had made on the news. J.A. at 88 (emphasis added). In sum, the prosecutor clearly misrepresented material evidence when he asserted that Halliburton had not been told it was the right name ... but the wrong face before she took the witness stand and that [t]he only person who has ever said that is Doug Thoresen [defense counsel]. J.A. at 560. Given that this court has recognized that it is improper for attorneys, especially prosecutors who generally have the confidence of juries, to misstate evidence, we conclude that the prosecutor's misstatement of the evidence in this case, specifically of Halliburton's testimony, was not only error but also was plain error. See Washington v. Hofbauer, 228 F.3d 689, 700 (6th Cir.2000) (citing Donnelly v. DeChristoforo, 416 U.S. 637, 646, 94 S.Ct. 1868, 40 L.Ed.2d 431 (1974)); see also Davis v. Zant, 36 F.3d 1538, 1548 n. 15 (11th Cir.1994) ( It is a fundamental tenet of the law that attorneys may not make material misstatements of fact in summation. ). Cf. A.B.A., ABA Standards for Criminal Justice Prosecution Function and Defense Function 3-5.8(a) (3d ed. 1993) ( The prosecutor should not intentionally misstate the evidence or mislead the jury as to the inferences it may draw. ). Additionally, because this court, along with the Supreme Court, has repeatedly noted that it is improper for counsel to make personal attacks on an opposing advocate, we also conclude that the prosecutor's claims that defense counsel was lying were not only error but also were plain error. 2015 Thomson Reuters.

As the trial transcript reveals, the prosecutor personally attacked defense counsel's truthfulness four times during his rebuttal argument by asserting that defense counsel was lying about Halliburton's testimony and trying to sneak ... one over on [the jury]. J.A. at 561. Specifically, the prosecutor asserted that defense counsel's characterization of Halliburton's testimony was one tremendous colossal lie, a lie, a bold fabrication, an absolutely whole lie, and just plain a lie. J.A. at 560-61. In sum, because Carter has successfully shown that the prosecutor committed clear error under current law by misrepresenting material evidence and accusing defense counsel of lying, we conclude that Carter has satisfied both the first and second requirements for relief under a plain error analysis. B. Whether The Misconduct Substantially Affected Carter's Rights and Warrants Reversal [7] We also conclude, based upon our analysis of the prosecutor's misconduct under the four factors of the Carroll test, that the prosecutor's actions affected Carter's substantial rights and warrant reversal. 1. Whether The Prosecutor's Comments Were Likely To Prejudice Carter The first required factor of the Carroll test is that the prosecutor's comments were likely to mislead and prejudice the jury. We believe that Carter has shown that the prosecutor's misstatement of Halliburton's testimony and personal attacks on defense counsel's truthfulness were likely to mislead the jury and cause prejudice to Carter. regarding Halliburton's At the outset, we note our belief that the prosecutor's misstatement testimony was inherently prejudicial to Carter. This court has consistently recognized that a prosecutor's misrepresentation of material evidence can have a significant impact on jury deliberations because a jury generally has confidence that a prosecuting attorney is faithfully *786 observing his obligation as a representative of a sovereignty. Washington, 228 F.3d at 700; see also United States v. Solivan, 937 F.2d 1146, 1150 (6th Cir.1991) (Because jurors are likely to place great confidence in the faithful execution of the obligations of a prosecuting attorney, improper insinuations or suggestions [by the prosecutor] are apt to carry [great] weight against a defendant and therefore are more likely to mislead a jury.); United States v. Smith, 500 F.2d 293, 295 (6th Cir.1974). 4 More importantly, the prosecutor's misrepresentation in this case held an even greater potential for misleading the jury because the misstated evidence, Halliburton's testimony, was central to the Government's case. Because Halliburton was the only person who was at the bank during the robbery to identify Carter as the robber, her identification testimony was of critical importance to the prosecution. Defense counsel recognized the significance of Halliburton's testimony and raised several significant and relevant issues for the jury to consider during his cross-examination of Halliburton. Specifically, he raised important questions regarding the propriety of Agent Whitten's telling Halliburton that it was the right name, Roquel Carter, but the wrong face just prior to Halliburton's taking the witness stand. As defense counsel's cross-examination of Halliburton revealed, Halliburton did not even know the name of the man shown on the Channel 4 TV news clip until a few days before trial and did not recall telling the police the name of the man on the clip when she identified him as the robber nearly two years before. Therefore, defense counsel highlighted serious questions regarding whether the name of the man in the clip even mattered to Halliburton before she testified. Additionally, defense counsel's cross-examination of Halliburton revealed that Halliburton had no intention to change her previous identification of Johnson until after Agent Whitten told her she had made a mistake, that Halliburton knew Carter was sitting at the defense table before she took the witness stand, and that Carter was the only black person in the courtroom at the time Halliburton testified. In other words, defense counsel pointed out critical problems concerning the reliability of Halliburton's in-court identification and important issues concerning possible attempts by the prosecution to influence Halliburton's testimony before she took the witness stand. 5 The prosecutor, however, tainted the jury's ability to weigh Halliburton's averments of honesty during her in- court identification of Carter against these suspicious circumstances when he repeatedly asserted that defense counsel was lying and mistakenly claimed that Halliburton did not admit to being told she had made a mistake in her initial identification. With these actions, the prosecutor may very well have caused the jurors, some of whom relied on Halliburton's in-court identification of Carter in 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 9 \f U.S. v. Carter, 236 F.3d 777 (2001) 2001 Fed.App. 0020P making their decision to *787 convict, to question whether they remembered Halliburton's testimony correctly. He also may have further caused these jurors to question other arguments presented by defense counsel who was portrayed by the prosecutor as lying. In sum, the prosecutor adversely influenced the jury's ability to assess Halliburton's credibility and to evaluate her in-court identification of Carter as the robber, in contrast to her previous identification of Terry Johnson as the robber. Such prejudice, however, could have been cured, [9] [8] or at least minimized, by curative instructions to the jury. Consequently, we must now determine whether any prejudice caused by the prosecutor's misconduct was cured by instructions given to the jury. Carroll, 26 F.3d at 1385 ( The first factor [whether the remarks tended to mislead the jury or to prejudice the defendant] includes consideration of whether the trial judge gave an appropriate cautionary instruction to the jury. ). Ordinarily, a court should not overturn a criminal conviction on the basis of a prosecutor's comments alone, especially where the district court has given the jury an instruction that may cure the error. See Young, 470 U.S. at 11-13, 105 S.Ct. 1038; United States v. Cobleigh, 75 F.3d 242, 247 (6th Cir.1996). As a general matter, juries are presumed to understand and follow directions from the court. United States v. Forrest, 17 F.3d 916, 920-21 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 511 U.S. 1113, 114 S.Ct. 2115, 128 L.Ed.2d 673 (1994). [10] In this case, although we believe that the district court could have given an instruction that neutralized the error, we do not believe that any of the jury instructions given at this trial sufficiently cured the prejudice caused by the prosecutor's actions. We note that defense counsel did not request any curative instruction. The only possibly relevant instruction given by the district court was an instruction that objections or arguments made by the lawyers are not evidence in the case. J.A. at 574. This instruction, however, was made along with all other routine instructions for evaluating the evidence presented at trial. Furthermore, the instruction was not given at the time of the improper comments. Instead, it was given only after closing arguments had been completed and, even then, after a fifteen-minute recess. Therefore, there was nothing directly linking this jury instruction to the prosecutor's misconduct. See Lent v. Wells, 861 F.2d 972, 977 (6th Cir.1988), cert. denied, 489 U.S. 1100, 109 S.Ct. 1577, 103 L.Ed.2d 943 (1989) (trial judge's instructions did not cure the error caused by the misconduct because [n]o curative instructions were given at the time of defense's objections and the judge did not mention the prosecutor's improper comments during his general charge to the jury); see also Smith, 500 F.2d at 298 (cautionary instruction did not neutralize the prejudice of comments that called attention to the defendants' failure to testify because it failed expressly to instruct the jury that no adverse inference could be drawn from [the defendants'] silence ). Cf. United States v. Cruz-Padilla, 227 F.3d 1064, 1069 (8th Cir.2000) (prejudice caused by prosecutorial misconduct during closing argument was not cured because the district court issued no curative instructions where the defense failed to object to the misconduct). We believe that measures more substantial than a general instruction that objections or arguments made by the lawyers are not evidence in the case were needed to cure the prejudicial effect of the prosecutor's comments during closing arguments. 6 As the Ninth Circuit stated in United States v. Kerr, it is very doubtful that the generalized observations of the court really conveyed a sufficient sense of judicial approval of both *788 content and circumstances needed to dispell [sic] the harm in the core of the prosecutor's statements. 981 F.2d 1050, 1053 (9th Cir.1992) (quotation omitted). In conclusion, in light of the suspect circumstances surrounding Halliburton's in- court identification and the fact that no curative instructions were given shortly after the prosecutor's improper comments during closing arguments, we conclude that the prosecutor's misconduct significantly impacted the jury's ability to assess Halliburton's testimony. 2. Whether The Prosecutor's Comments Were Isolated Or Extensive The second required factor under the Carroll test is that the improper comments must be more than mere isolated remarks, incapable of infecting the entire trial. If a prosecutor's comments were simply isolated remarks made during the course of a long trial, then the error caused by such misconduct may be harmless. United States v. Leon, 534 F.2d 667, 679 (6th Cir.1976). After considering the prosecutor's improper comments within the context of the entire trial, we conclude that such comments were not merely harmless, isolated comments but instead were prejudicial statements that infected the entire trial. The prosecutor's improper comments occurred during his rebuttal 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 10 \f U.S. v. Carter, 236 F.3d 777 (2001) 2001 Fed.App. 0020P argument and therefore were the last words from an attorney that were heard by the jury before deliberations. Given the critical nature of Halliburton's testimony, the weaknesses in some of the circumstantial evidence presented at trial, see infra, and the lasting impression that certainly remained with the jury after the prosecutor's rebuttal argument, we cannot state that the prosecutor's conduct did not shake our faith in the jury's verdict. Moreover, we do not believe that the fact the prosecutor made these improper comments only during closing arguments alters the extent of the prejudice caused by them. 7 As we have previously acknowledged, even a single misstep on the part *789 of the prosecutor may be so destructive of the right of the defendant to a fair trial that reversal must follow. Smith, 500 F.2d at 297 (quoting Pierce v. United States, 86 F.2d 949, 952 (6th Cir.1936)). [11] We also do not believe that the prosecutor's comments were an invited response to defense counsel's statements during closing argument. 8 Instead, we see defense counsel's arguments as a restatement *790 of Halliburton's explanation of how she came to identify Carter, instead of Johnson, as the robber, and the reasons why defense counsel believed such changes and explanations lacked credibility, i.e. Halliburton's changes reflected her desire to please the prosecution. In other words, we view defense counsel's closing argument as simply a legitimate attempt to cast doubt on the credibility of a witness who, for two years, had held the belief that Terry Johnson, the man she had confidently identified as the robber only two days after the robbery, 9 was the man who robbed Hartsville Bank on October 15, 1996, and who changed her identification testimony only after a federal agent informed her that it was the right name ... but the wrong face on the TV news clip. J.A. at 88. Finally, we do not believe that the prejudicial effects of the prosecutor's improper comments were any less extensive because the prosecutor later told the jury that it could question the credibility of Halliburton. The prosecutor stated: I don't know what more I can say to that. You may question [Halliburton] for sure.... [Seeing] her live and in person look at ... Carter, look at these pictures, and tell you what her honest answer is to the best of her ability, as you watched her go through the thought process for the very first time, and answer the questions. That is to your benefit as judges of the facts of this case. J.A. at 561. [12] As we previously noted in this opinion, juries are apt to place great confidence in the statements of prosecutors, and we do not believe that this brief statement by the prosecutor was sufficient to overcome the prejudice caused by his repeated insistence that defense counsel was lying and that Halliburton had not admitted to being told she had made a mistake. 3. Whether The Comments Were Deliberately Or Accidentally Placed Before The Jury The third required factor under the Carroll test is that the improper comments be deliberately placed before the jury. After careful review, we conclude that the prosecutor knowingly and deliberately made his improper comments before the jury. In Young, the Supreme Court explained that the proper course of action for an attorney who takes issue with comments made by opposing counsel is for that attorney to object to the offensive comments, not to respond with equally offensive comments. Young, 470 U.S. at 13, 105 S.Ct. 1038 (noting that the prosecutor at the close of defense summation should have objected to the defense counsel's improper statements with a request that the court give a *791 timely warning and curative instruction to the jury ). In this case, the prosecutor did not object to what he believed was a mischaracterization of Halliburton's testimony by defense counsel, nor did he attempt to refute defense counsel's closing argument by pointing to contradictory evidence presented at trial. Instead, the prosecutor repeatedly claimed that defense counsel, a man whom, as the prosecutor noted during appellate oral argument, he had known for many years and whom he held in high regard, was telling a colossal lie. In other words, rather than properly object to what he believed were improper statements made by defense counsel, the prosecutor simply committed another clear wrong and thereby eliminated any possibility that the district court could correct defense counsel's wrongs with a curative instruction. When such action is viewed in light of 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 11 \f U.S. v. Carter, 236 F.3d 777 (2001) 2001 Fed.App. 0020P the prosecutor's familiarity with defense counsel, it must be considered deliberate and calculated. Indeed, the very repetition with which the prosecutor stated that defense counsel had lied, in and of itself, reveals that such comments were not accidentally placed before the jury. See United States v. Smith, 962 F.2d 923, 935 (9th Cir.1992) ( The repeated comments also demonstrate that the errors were not inadvertent; clearly, we are not dealing with a spontaneous comment that could be regretted but not retracted. ). Consequently, we conclude that Carter has also satisfied the third factor of the Carroll test. 4. Strength Of The Evidence The fourth and final required factor under the Carroll test is that the strength of the evidence against the defendant not be overwhelming. We conclude that, while there arguably was sufficient circumstantial evidence presented at trial to support the jury's guilty verdict, 10 this evidence was not so strong as to overcome the improper and inflammatory comments made by the prosecutor. Although numerous pieces of circumstantial evidence presented at trial seem to suggest that Carter may have robbed the Hartsville Bank, we do not consider the cumulative weight of this evidence to be overwhelming, especially in the light of the evidence suggesting that Terry Johnson may have been the robber, not Carter. For example, evidence at trial revealed that both Halliburton, the teller who was robbed at the bank, and Sergeant Lanier, who chased a suspect matching a BOLO for Carter two days after the robbery, initially identified Terry Johnson as the robbery suspect. Additionally, evidence at trial revealed that Terry Johnson had escaped from a prison, *792 where he was serving time for a conviction of robbery and carjacking, on October 1, 1996, and that Terry Johnson was arrested in Lebanon, a town near Gallatin and Hartsville, Tennessee, just two days after the Hartsville Bank robbery. Evidence also showed that Terry Johnson and Carter both had their hair in braids during the relevant period. [13] In addition to the evidence indicating that Johnson may have been the robber, there also are some weaknesses in the other evidence presented against Carter. For instance, even assuming that it was Carter, and not Johnson, who fled from Officer Oliver and Sergeant Lanier, the negative inference which can be drawn from this evidence is weakened by the fact that Carter may have had another reason to flee from officers: his failure to appear for a warrant against him in Indianapolis. 11 Therefore, it is possible that Carter was fleeing because of his warrant in Indiana when he fled from both Sergeant Lanier and Officer Oliver, and not because he committed the bank robbery in Hartsville. Additionally, Sergeant Lanier's testimony regarding the chase is weakened by the fact that his written report failed to mention that he observed an Indiana license plate and did not identify 99S68881 as an observed license number. Furthermore, at trial many of the witnesses providing circumstantial evidence against Carter, including Holder, Ford, and Cornwell, could not identify Carter as the man they saw on the day of the robbery. Finally, although the police claim that Ms. Halcomb, Carter's aunt, identified him as the person Ms. Ford described in the Citgo station on October 15, 1996, the evidence shows that, contrary to a frequently used police procedure, Ms. Halcomb did not sign or affirm any written statement verifying this identification. In sum, in light of the evidence suggesting that Johnson perhaps may have been the Hartsville Bank robber and the problems with some of the other evidence presented against Carter, we conclude that Carter has also satisfied the fourth and final factor of the Carroll test and thus has shown the prejudice required for relief under a plain error analysis. See, e.g., Kerr, 981 F.2d at 1054 (reversing on ground of prosecutorial misconduct where the testimony of the four vouched witnesses was crucial to the government's case and the prosecutor's argument and [o]nly indirect evidence connected [the defendant] to the [crime] ). Cf. Boyle, 201 F.3d at 717-18 (reversing for prosecutorial misconduct even though the evidence against the defendant was strong); United States v. Francis, 170 F.3d 546, 552 (6th Cir.1999) (same). *793 [14] As our final step, we conclude that the error here was of a magnitude seriously to affect the fairness and integrity of judicial proceedings. As noted above, the prosecutor in this case failed to honor his obligation as a representative of the sovereign when he misrepresented critical evidence at the close of trial with no opportunity for an argumentative response and when he made personal attacks on opposing counsel that may have affected the jury's view of counsel's entire defense. To hold that such action does not seriously affect the integrity of judicial proceedings would be tantamount to excusing the prosecutor's deliberate disregard of his duty to uphold the Government's interest in ensuring 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Carter, 236 F.3d 777 (2001) 2001 Fed.App. 0020P that justice shall be done, not that it shall win a case, and would render a profound blow to our judicial system's ideal of providing each defendant with a fair trial. Berger, 295 U.S. at 88, 55 S.Ct. 629. III. CONCLUSION In conclusion, Carter has successfully established that the prosecutor committed misconduct sufficient to warrant reversal under a plain error analysis. Carter has demonstrated that the prosecutor committed clear and obvious error by misstating material evidence at trial and improperly accusing defense counsel of lying. Carter has also shown that such misconduct affected the outcome of the trial. Specifically, Carter has shown that the prosecutor's improper comments were highly likely to mislead the jury, that the effect of the comments was considerable, that the prosecutor deliberately made the improper comments to the jury, and that the strength of the evidence against him was not so overwhelming that it negated the improper comments made by the prosecutor. In sum, because we believe that allowing a conviction to stand here where the prosecutor affected Carter's substantial rights by clearly misstating a key witness's testimony and repeatedly asserting that defense counsel lied during closing arguments would pose a clear threat to the integrity of judicial proceedings, we REVERSE the district court's judgment in this case and REMAND for a new trial. Parallel Citations 2001 Fed.App. 0020P Footnotes * 1 2 3 4 5 6 The Honorable Denise Page Hood, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Michigan, sitting by designation. Terry Johnson was arrested on October 18, 1996, in Lebanon, Tennessee, which is near both Gallatin and Hartsville, Tennessee. He had escaped from Simpson County Jail on October 1, 1996, where he was serving time for carjacking and robbery. At the time of his arrest, Johnson had braids in his hair. As noted above, Sergeant Lanier also initially identified Terry Johnson as the man who eluded his capture. The TV news clip on Channel 4 was based upon an interview with Sergeant Lanier that occurred after Lanier had unsuccessfully chased the suspect in White House, Tennessee. Halliburton's interview with Agent Whitten on December 8, 1998 took place in the presence of the prosecutor in this case. J.A. at 51. We note, however, that our analysis of Carter's prosecutorial misconduct claim indirectly involves an analysis of Carter's remaining arguments, which are (1) that there was insufficient evidence from which a jury could constitutionally find Carter guilty; (2) that the district court abused its discretion in giving a flight instruction in its charge to the jury; and (3) that the district court abused its discretion by denying both his motion for a mistrial and his motion to strike the entire jury panel on the ground of prosecutorial misconduct during voir dire. As the Supreme Court stated in Berger v. United States: The United States Attorney is the representative not of an ordinary party to a controversy, but of a sovereignty whose obligation to govern impartially is as compelling as its obligation to govern at all; and whose interest, therefore, in a criminal prosecution is not that it shall win a case, but that justice shall be done. As such, he is in a peculiar and very definite sense the servant of the law, the twofold aim of which is that guilt shall not escape or innocence suffer. He may prosecute with earnestness and vigor-indeed, he should do so. But, while he may strike hard blows, he is not at liberty to strike foul ones. It is as much his duty to refrain from improper methods calculated to produce a wrongful conviction as it is to use every legitimate means to bring about a just one. Berger, 295 U.S. 78, 88, 55 S.Ct. 629, 79 L.Ed. 1314 (1935). Other evidence that tends to weaken Halliburton's testimony includes the fact that Halliburton was first asked to view a photograph spread of potential suspects in September of 1998, nearly two years after her initial identification and just a few months before the trial. Furthermore, the only other black person who had even been in the courtroom during Carter's trial was a woman, and she [was] part of the court personnel. J.A. at 76. While we do not rule that it was error for the district court not to instruct the jury sua sponte of the impropriety of the prosecutor's comments, we note our belief that the district court should have done so or at the very least, should have called a sidebar conference with the lawyers. See Young, 470 U.S. at 10, 105 S.Ct. 1038 ( The judge must meet situations as they arise and [be able] to cope with ... the contingencies inherent in the adversary process. ) (quotation omitted, 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 13 \f U.S. v. Carter, 236 F.3d 777 (2001) 2001 Fed.App. 0020P 7 alteration in original). A trial judge should be alert to deviations from proper argument and take prompt corrective action as appropriate. Kerr, 981 F.2d at 1054. In fact, the prosecutor made improper comments at another time during the judicial proceedings. As Carter argues in his brief, the prosecutor also made improper comments during voir dire. The events occurred as follows. The prosecutor first questioned the jury panel: Q: Anybody here ever been down to-not down to, but spent a lot of time in, grew up in, worked in, got relatives, close friends in Talladega, Alabama? Pell City? All right. Ms. Qualls. Wow, I didn't think I would ring a bell on that one. A: I have a good friend who lives in Talladega, Alabama. But I haven't seen him in a long time. Q: Well, let me put it this way, have you had any occasions to hear about-this is 1996 now-anybody, any friends down there who work in law enforcement? A: No. Q: Had any occasion to hear about a shoot-out with police back in October of 1996, down there? Does that ring a bell? A: No. J.A. at 294. Following this line of questioning, defense counsel asked to approach the bench with government counsel, moved for a mistrial, and moved to strike the entire panel on the ground that the prosecutor's questioning was prejudicial because Carter was not charged with a shoot-out in this case. J.A. at 295. The district court denied the motion but instructed the prosecutor not to make a reference to a shoot-out or anything else that may have happened. J.A. at 295. Not satisfied with the court's decision, defense counsel reiterated his objection to the prosecutor's line of questioning, stating that he felt the jury panel was affected by the questioning and that its members now knew that this Defendant has been charged in a shoot-out. J.A. at 296. In response, the district court noted defense counsel's concerns but pointed out that the jury panel did not know Carter had been charged with a shoot-out but had simply heard something about a shoot-out. J.A. at 296. The court then overruled defense counsel's motion. At conclusion of the side-bar, the prosecutor proceeded to question the jury panel about connections to Talladega County, Alabama. What is interesting about the prosecutor's questions, however, is that, just immediately after the court pointed out that the panel was not aware of Carter's charge in a shoot-out, the prosecutor, although not directly mentioning or asking anything about Carter's involvement in the shoot-out, asked a question which clearly implied Carter's involvement in a shoot-out in Talladega County. Government counsel asked, And my question would be, is there anything that you might have heard that might conceivably be connected with this case? J.A. at 296-97 (emphasis added). When viewed in the context of the prosecutor's prior questions during voir dire, this question seems to hint indirectly to the jury that Carter was indeed involved in a shoot-out in Talladega County. Thus, the question potentially may have prejudiced the jury panel against Carter. In sum, as the district court recognized, the prosecutor made improper comments during voir dire by making a reference to a shoot-out. In addition to this comment, the prosecutor also arguably made another improper comment when he asked a question that implied Carter was indeed involved in a shoot-out. 8 In his closing argument, defense counsel stated: MR. THORESEN: The next false trail is this picture. This picture which was broadcast on the night of October 17 by two media stations. And Terri Halliburton saw this some two days after the robbery when her memory was fresh, when the details of this were fresh-not two years later. And she identified this man [Johnson] as being the person who robbed her. That is a false trail. Since when is it a false trail for a witness to a crime to make an identification of a [perpetrator]? This [Johnson] is who[m] she identified. The name Roquel Carter was used and so the Government assumed-the Government assumed that the picture shown on Channel 4 and the picture shown on Channel 2 was really Roquel Carter. And that assumption stayed there with the Government for two years. And when Terri Halliburton got her subpoena to testify in this case, she still had identified the person who robbed this bank as [Johnson]. And when she came to Nashville, what happened? Was the respect, given these circumstances, by letting her determine whether or not she had made a mistake, whether or not this was, in fact, the person who robbed the bank? Was there a line-up conducted? Did anyone say, Gosh, we need to get this rectified, we need to see really what is going on here. Instead of that happening, what happened was the statement was made, You got the right name, but the wrong face. You got the right name, and the wrong face. And that comes from-that comes not from [Halliburton's] 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 14 \f U.S. v. Carter, 236 F.3d 777 (2001) 2001 Fed.App. 0020P mouth, not from the crime victim, not from the person who saw what had happened; it came from the Government's mouth. And from that moment on, I tell you, that her testimony was poisoned. She knew that the Government did not think this was the person who robbed her.... [This affects] the validity of the identification made by the witness. It affects the identification, the reliability, whether it's correct or not, whether you can rely upon it, whether you can go home with the same degree of certainty that you would apply to your ordinary affairs to make important decisions, to rest easily as to a reasonable doubt, that this was the person who robbed the bank. Instead of some Government agent saying, You got the right name but the wrong face. And isn't that a false trail? Isn't [that] a huge false trail? And after that, knowing that that was their opinion, letting this witness come in here and see the only black man in this room, knowing that that is the person who the Government thought was going to be the person, and make an identification. That seems really strange to me. And it seems really strange that Officer Lanier would do the same thing. I don't know about lightning striking once, but I know lightning struck twice here; it struck twice in the form of Terri Halliburton and struck twice in the same place-in the same place with respect to the testimony of Officer Lanier.... It struck with both of these witnesses saying, within two days of this robbery occurring, that [Johnson] is the man. * * * * * * And before [Halliburton] was told this, there was one person [whom] she had identified as being the bank robber, and it wasn't Roquel Carter; it was this man [Johnson]. And interestingly, that is what Officer Lanier had done. * * * * * * And I have a great deal of difficulty in believing [that an accused person will be treated fairly in court] when a witness is told that you have got the right name but the wrong face before the witness hits the courtroom, before the witness has an opportunity of seeing the person, that that is fair. * * * * * * There are a lot of false trails here. And these false trails are a result of the Government's behavior of what they have specifically done in telling witnesses things and not telling them things, and not proving this case. It's the result of a closed mind, that was closed at ten o'clock on the morning of October 15 of 1996, before this investigation ever got started. J.A. at 548-51, 558-59 (emphasis added). 9 Halliburton testified that she told the police she was certain of her identification when she initially identified Terry Johnson as the robber. The relevant portions of the trial transcript read: Q: .... Ms. King of our office interviewed you, is that right? A: That's correct. * * * * * * Q: And you told Ms. King you were certain [that Terry Johnson, the man you saw on the TV news clip, was the robber] when she interviewed you? A: Yes. Q: And you told Agent Whitten you were certain [of the same thing] when he interviewed you in November of 1996 a short time after the bank robbery, is that right? A: Yes, sir. J.A. at 72-73. 10 When considering the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, a reasonable juror could conclude that (1) Ms. Colwell sold Carter the green Chrysler that was recovered by Officer Oliver; (2) Carter was the man Ms. Ford saw enter the Hartsville Citgo station and change into coveralls shortly before the bank robbery; (3) Carter was the man whom Ms. Cornwell saw at the carwash before the bank robbery; (4) Carter's green car was the same car that Mr. Holder saw the robber drive away in after the robbery; (5) it was Carter who fled from both Officer Oliver and Sergeant Lanier; and (6) Carter fled because he knew he committed the robbery at the Hartsville Bank. In sum, a rational fact finder could decide that Carter was the man who robbed Hartsville Bank on October 15, 1996. See, e.g., United States v. Bond, 22 F.3d 662, 667 (6th Cir.1994) (holding that there was sufficient evidence for a robbery conviction where the getaway car, a red Firebird, was identified by an individual who followed the vehicle and wrote down the license plate; the Firebird had been stolen from a gas station in a nearby city several weeks earlier; the Firebird had a defendant's fingerprints both on its inside and outside on the driver's side; a friend of one defendant testified that he had seen him driving a red Firebird 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The district court included the following instruction on flight in its charge to the jury: 11 INSTRUCTION: Flight. You have received evidence that after the crime was supposed to have been committed, the Defendant, Roquel Allen Carter, fled. If you believe from the evidence that the Defendant did indeed flee, then you may consider this conduct, along with all the other evidence, in deciding whether the Government has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that he committed the crime charged. This conduct may indicate that he thought he was guilty and was trying to avoid punishment. On the other hand, sometimes an innocent person may flee to avoid being arrested, or for some other innocent reason. J.A. at 577. In light of Sergeant Lanier's and Officer Hickman's testimony at trial, we do not believe it was an abuse of discretion for the district court to give this flight instruction. Additionally, we do not believe that the flight instruction violated Carter's right not to testify or incriminate himself. This instruction, which comes from the Sixth Circuit Pattern Jury Instructions, does not appear to suggest guilt on the part of Carter because of his decision not to testify or explain incidents of flight. See Committee on Pattern Criminal Jury Instructions, Pattern Criminal Jury Instructions 7.14 (1991 ed.). Rather, the instruction states that evidence of flight may or may not indicate a defendant's guilty conscience or intent to avoid punishment. See Illinois v. Wardlow, 528 U.S. 119, 123-27, 120 S.Ct. 673, 676-77, 145 L.Ed.2d 570 (2000) (noting that although flight may be indicative of ongoing criminal activity, there are also innocent reasons for flight from police).

No. CRIM.97 10060 REK. | Aug. 15, 2002. Jury returned guilty verdict on six federal counts of engaging in transactions in criminally derived property. Defendant moved for judgment of acquittal and for new trial. The District Court, Keeton, J., held that: (1) evidence was insufficient to satisfy knowledge element as to four of six subject transactions that bore no indicia of being out of the ordinary; (2) evidence was sufficient to satisfy knowledge element as to remaining two counts involving insufficiently identified bank account holder; (3) prosecutorial misconduct, consisting of overcharging, did not warrant dismissal of two remaining counts or new trial on those counts.

The Indictment On March 11, 1997, a Grand Jury of the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts returned a 103 Count Indictment against Stephen J. Flemmi and Michael L. Carucci. It charged only Flemmi in Counts 67 69. It charged against both, *119 Edward T. Hinchey, Sloane & Walsh, Boston, MA, for Estate of Michael J. Donahue, interested party. in Count 1, a Money Laundering Conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. 1956(h); 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 2 \f U.S. v. Carucci, 222 F.Supp.2d 117 (2002) in Counts 2 66, substantive money-laundering offenses under 18 U.S.C. 1956; in Counts 70 102, transactions in criminally derived property under 18 U.S.C. 1957; and in Count 103, a RICO Conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. 1962(d). (Docket No. 1, filed March 11, 1997). the indictment were Money Laundering Concluding Forfeiture Allegations and Racketeering Forfeiture Allegations, the practical effect of which was to deprive both defendants of access to their respective interests in numerous real estate parcels and bank accounts, regardless of whether or not the government would be able to prove its charges at trial. The indictment also alleged that Stephen J. Flemmi had been involved continuously since the 1960s ... in organized crime within the District of Massachusetts and elsewhere and during the 1970s acted in a supervisory position in a criminal organization known by various names, including The Winter Hill Gang and South Boston. The opening paragraph of the INTRODUCTION of the indictment added, as part of paragraph (a): In or about 1979, the defendant STEPHEN J. FLEMMI and James J. Bulger became the leaders of the Winter Hill Gang. The defendant STEPHEN J. FLEMMI has remained a leader of the Winter Hill Gang up to the date of this indictment. Id. After allegations in part (b) about income from unlawful activity as sources of Flemmi's income and allegations in part (c) about MLC Properties Inc., d/b/a Group Boston Real Estate (also called Group Boston), as a Massachusetts Corporation engaged in the business of brokering, managing, developing, and investing in real estate properties, characterizing it as a *120 financial institution as that phrase is used in 18 U.S.C. 1956(c)(6) and 31 U.S.C. 5312(a)(2), the INTRODUCTION continued: (d) The defendant MICHAEL L. CARUCCI is the President, Clerk, Treasurer and Director of Group Boston and owns 100% of the outstanding shares of stock in Group Boston. The defendant MICHAEL L. CARUCCI is a person involved in real estate closings and settlements, and is engaged in, and has activities which affect, interstate and foreign commerce. (e) Between approximately 1991 and the present, the defendant MICHAEL L. CARUCCI has participated in multiple business and real estate ventures with the defendant STEPHEN J. FLEMMI, as the defendant FLEMMI's partner and otherwise. Id. B. Availability of Prompt Trial The judge to whom this case was randomly drawn under the court's assignment system was available to try the charges in this case against both defendants together, or against them separately in sequence, as appropriate, during the period provided by law for speedy trial in the absence of excludable time apart from that incident to severance, if severance had been determined to be appropriate. It was approximately five years before any part of the case came to trial. Trial commenced with jury selection on March 11, 12, and 14, 2002, on 100 of 103 Counts, and against defendant Carucci only. The court at all times after indictment in 1997 had been prepared to try the case promptly upon its being ready for trial. For a period of a few months the originally assigned judge would have been unavailable because of major surgery, and the case would then have been tried before another judge of the court. But the originally assigned judge was again available before any part of the case was ready for trial. C. The Pattern of Delay On the full record that is now before me in this case, I find that the United States Attorney for the District of Massachusetts and the Assistant United States Attorneys to whom he assigned responsibility for prosecution of this case chose not to seek a prompt trial. Either according to an initial plan or by a series of decisions as circumstances associated with the case developed, they preferred to delay trial for approximately five years. Each of the defendants also had his own distinctive reasons for preferring delay over prompt trial. 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 3 \f U.S. v. Carucci, 222 F.Supp.2d 117 (2002) Thus, all parties requested extensions of time on grounds the court found acceptable and consistent with excludable-time provisions of rules regarding speedy trial rights of the public and the parties. D. Status of the Case at Time of Impanelment When the government eventually declared it was ready to proceed with trial, it was barred from proceeding with the trial against defendant Stephen J. Flemmi under a plea agreement in United States v. Stephen J. Flemmi, Criminal Number 94 10287 MLW, a case in which the indictment also included allegations of money laundering and conspiracy to commit money laundering. (See United States' Motion to Dismiss Indictment with Respect to Defendant Stephen J. Flemmi, Docket No. 186, filed March 18, 2002; the court allowed that motion by an endorsement on its margin on March 19, 2002). Before the trial commenced, the court concluded also that discovery requests and motions to dismiss all or at least some counts of the indictment against the defendant Michael L. Carucci, ultimately determined to be meritorious at least in part, *121 had to be heard and decided before the court could properly submit the case to the jury that was impaneled on March 11, 12, and 14, 2002. The court denied the requests that the court hold an evidentiary hearing and make its decision on whether it would submit the conspiracy charges against Michael L. Carucci before impaneling a jury. The court gave notice that instead it would follow the practice of making its final decision on that matter after the close of all the evidence, as approved and directed by the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in, among other cases, United States v. Ciampaglia, 628 F.2d 632, 638 (1st Cir.1980), and United States v. Bradshaw, 281 F.3d 278, 284 (1st Cir.2002). Because the government still had not disclosed admissible evidence sufficient for the case to go to the jury against defendant Michael L. Carucci on either of the two conspiracy Counts, the court warned government counsel that it would allow a mistrial if requested by defendant Carucci on adequately supported grounds that the government had withheld evidence that it should have disclosed in advance of trial and in fact disclosed only during trial, and that if the government did not produce during trial admissible evidence sufficient to close the gaps in the governments's advance proffer of evidence to show that Carucci had knowingly become a member of a conspiracy charged against him, the court expected to direct acquittal at least on the conspiracy counts and possibly on substantive counts on which the court had declined to direct acquittal before impanelment but with notice that it would consider on the merits, count by count, after the close of evidence and before submission to the jury, the defense motion for acquittal because of the government's failure to persuade the court that it had a valid legal theory, supported by adequate evidence for submission of each particular count to the jury. E. Order of Acquittal on Specified Counts Before Submission of Other Counts to the Jury Near the conclusion of the Rule 29 Hearing, on April 4, 2002, the court stated and explained its order of acquittal on Counts 1, 14 66, 76 103. (Transcript of Rule 29 Hearing of April 4, 2002, Docket No. 263, at pp. 30 33). As noted before, Carucci was not charged in Counts 67 69. Thus, the counts remaining to be submitted to the jury were Counts 2 13 and 70 75. See id. at p. 33. F. Verdict In the Verdict received on April 16, 2002, the jury found the defendant: NOT GUILTY on Counts 2 13, and GUILTY on Counts 70 75. (Verdict, Docket No. 258). III. Applicable Law A. Reservations Stated by the Court in the Charge Conference In the Charge Conference of April 5, 2002, very helpful suggestions of counsel for the government and the defendant clarified issues that had been troubling in earlier hearings. With the benefit of these suggestions, the court was then and still is now satisfied that the charge given to the jury correctly states the law on nearly all of the issues addressed. 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 4 \f U.S. v. Carucci, 222 F.Supp.2d 117 (2002) On a few of the objections then made and later stated by defense counsel, after the charge was given to the jury and before they commenced deliberations, I expressed my concern and gave notice of my willingness to reconsider afresh in post-verdict proceedings any matters essential to deciding what rulings I should make on post-verdict motions. These matters are *122 identified in the Transcript of the Charge Conference (Docket No. 264). (1) One issue of ongoing concern was whether the government had advanced or could advance any valid legal theory of conspiracy together with a proffer of admissible evidence sufficient to support a finding of a conspiracy that defendant Carucci had manifested agreement to becoming a member of the conspiracy. See defense counsel's argument, id. at 3 6, and my response, id. at 6 7. (2) Another issue concerned whether the government had advanced or could advance, for each substantive count, any viable legal theory together with a proffer of admissible evidence sufficient to support a jury finding of each of the elements of the substantive offense identified by that legal theory beyond reasonable doubt. issues concerning whether Among the subsidiary issues bearing on particular counts were the government had proffered or ever could proffer admissible evidence sufficient to support a finding that profits from any of the alleged unlawful activities ended up in bank accounts upon which checks to American Equipment, produced by Flemmi individually or through the Mary Irene Trust, were drawn. Id. at 24. Another subsidiary issue concerned whether Flemmi's daughter, Jeannette Benedetti, or others in the family, gave to RECOLL Management funds derived from identifiable unlawful activities for the purchase of a condominium from or through RECOLL Management. See defense counsel's argument, id. at 3 6, and my response, id. at 6 7. Another subsidiary issue concerned causal connection. Defendant agreed that the government was not required under 18 U.S.C. 1956 to trace proceeds of a particular sale (or other transaction) to a particular specified unlawful activity, id. at 24, but argued that the government had to show some causal connection between an identifiable unlawful activity and bank funds used in the transaction charged in a particular count, id. at 3, 24. (3) Another set of issues concerned the instructions on willful blindness. See id. at 20 24. (4) Another set of issues concerned the defense contention of government misconduct by concealment, id. at 31, and the defense contention that one or more counts should be dismissed by application of a legal test for dismissal of charges in an indictment under a factors analysis, id. at 32 33. (5) Another set of issues concerned the use and meaning in various contexts of the word willfully, id., at 34 36, 39. (6) Another set of issues concerned the defense contention that the government had proffered no admissible evidence, direct or circumstantial, that Flemmi collected extortionate extensions of credit, id. at 49 52. B. Applicable Law as Stated in the Charge to the Jury Excerpts from the Charge to the Jury that are potentially relevant to issues remaining for decision on post-verdict motions are recited here: The charges submitted to you are in Counts 2 13 and 70 75 of the indictment. . . . . . Counts 70 75 charge that the defendant Michael Carucci, along with Stephen Flemmi, knowingly violated the statute prohibiting monetary transactions in criminally derived property, with a value of over $10,000, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1957. The defendant contends that he did not know that any of the funds involved in the purchase of the commercial condominium at 362 Commonwealth Avenue, *123 the equipment from Commonwealth Laundry, or the services from Mr. Heat derived from any unlawful activity by Stephen Flemmi. He instead believed that the funds used by Flemmi or his family were legitimate funds derived from bank accounts. Even if you believe that Mr. Carucci was aware that Flemmi's reputation was not favorable, absent proof beyond a reasonable doubt that he knew that the 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 5 \f U.S. v. Carucci, 222 F.Supp.2d 117 (2002) funds for the specific transactions that are the subject of Counts 2 13 and 70 75 derived from Flemmi's unlawful activity then Mr. Carucci is entitled to an acquittal on all counts. . . . . . Counts 70 75 of the indictment contain allegations of acts by defendant Michael Carucci and others that constitute transactions in criminally derived property in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1957. Title 18, Section 1957(a) of the United States Code provides, in pertinent part, that: Whoever ... knowingly engages or attempts to engage in a monetary transaction in criminally derived property that is of a value greater than $10,000 and is derived from specified unlawful activity ... shall be guilty of an offense against the United States. In order to prove a violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1957, the government must prove the following three elements beyond a reasonable doubt: First Element. The defendant engaged or attempted to engage in a monetary transaction with a value of more than $10,000. Second Element. The defendant knew that the property involved in the transaction had been derived from some form of criminal activity. Third Element. The property involved in the transaction was actually derived from specified unlawful activity. First Eement. To satisfy the first element, the government must prove that the defendant knowingly engaged in, or attempted to engage in, a monetary transaction involving property of a value greater than $10,000. A monetary transaction is the deposit, withdrawal, transfer, or exchange, in or affecting interstate commerce, of funds or a monetary instrument by, through, or to a financial institution. I have previously defined for you the terms monetary instrument and financial institution. Thus, the transaction must involve three things: First, it must be in, or have some minimal relationship to, interstate commerce. Second, it must be by, through, or to a financial institution. For example, drawing a check on a bank account would satisfy this requirement. Third, the property involved must have a value greater than $10,000. Second Element. To prove the second element, the government must show that the defendant knew that the money involved in the transaction was criminally derived property. Criminally derived property includes any property constituting or derived from proceeds of criminal activity. This means that the property must have been obtained from some previous, separate criminal action. The government is only required to show that the defendant knew that the property was derived from some form of criminal activity. It does not have to prove that the defendant knew what particular type of criminal act produced the property. *124 In order to prove the element of knowledge, the government must show that the defendant actually knew that the property was derived from criminal activity. It is not sufficient for the government to show that the defendant might have known or should have known. In determining whether the defendant knew that the property was derived from criminal activity, the jury must make a decision about the defendant's state of mind at the time of the transaction. It is impossible to prove this directly, because the jury cannot look into the defendant's mind. Therefore, you may rely on circumstantial evidence in making this determination. You should consider all the facts and circumstances shown in the evidence in order to infer with a reasonable degree of accuracy what the defendant's state of mind was. In deciding whether the defendant acted knowingly, you may infer that the defendant had knowledge that the property involved in the transaction was derived from criminal activity if you find that he deliberately closed his eyes to the fact that otherwise would have been obvious to 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 6 \f U.S. v. Carucci, 222 F.Supp.2d 117 (2002) him. It is for the jury to decide whether the defendant was willfully blind to the fact that the property was criminally derived and, if so, what inference should be drawn. It is important, however, to bear in mind that mere negligence or mistake in failing to learn that the property was derived from criminal activity is not sufficient. The government is not required to prove that the defendant knew that the transaction involving criminally derived property was itself an illegal act. In other words, although the defendant must know that the property was derived from criminal acts, the law does not require that he be aware that the transaction involving that property was a separate illegal act. Third Element. To prove the third element of the offense, the government must show that the property involved in the transaction was actually derived from specified criminal activity. Specified criminal activity refers to crimes included in a list of offenses included in the statute. I have already instructed you on the specified unlawful activity alleged in the indictment. It is for the jury to decide whether the government has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the property involved in the transaction was actually derived from the criminal activities just mentioned. In proving the third element, it is not necessary for the government to show that all of the property involved in the transaction was derived from the criminal activity. The government can meet its burden of proof even if some of the involved property was derived from lawful sources and was commingled with the criminally derived property in the transaction, so long as the government proves beyond reasonable doubt that at least $10,000 of each monetary transaction was derived from specified unlawful activity. In determining whether the property involved in a transaction was derived from specified criminal activity, you may consider circumstantial evidence insofar as it would support common sense inferences based on the realities of human experience. As already mentioned, the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant knew that the property involved in the transaction was derived from criminal activity. The government, however, does not need to show that the defendant knew that the property was derived from any *125 of the offenses that qualify as specified criminal activity. All that is required is knowledge that the property was produced by some form of unlawful action. I am sending a copy of the relevant portion of the indictment into the jury room for you to have during your deliberations. You may use it to read the crimes which the defendant is charged with committing. You are reminded, however, that an indictment is merely an accusation and is not to be used by you as any proof of the conduct charged. (Charge to the Jury, Docket No. 305 at 17, 45 49). IV. Count 70 Under applicable law, on Count 70 the government's burden was to prove beyond reasonable doubt each of the following three elements: First Element. The defendant engaged or attempted to engage in a monetary transaction with a value of more than $10,000. Second Element. The defendant knew that the property involved in the transaction had been derived from some form of criminal activity. Third Element. The property involved in the transaction was actually derived from specified unlawful activity. Charge to the Jury, Part III above, at page 10. See also, e.g., 18 U.S.C. 1957; United States v. Sokolow, 91 F.3d 396, 408 (3d Cir.1996); United States v. Gabriele, 63 F.3d 61, 65 (1st Cir.1995). [1] The transaction identified in Count 70 of the Indictment was the June 4, 1993 transfer, in the amount of $35,883, of Bank of Braintree check # 108 (account # 146400161), payable to the order of American Equipment Corp. for the purchase of laundromat equipment by Commonwealth Laundries & Cleaners, Inc. 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 7 \f U.S. v. Carucci, 222 F.Supp.2d 117 (2002) I conclude that under applicable law the defense stated a valid objection to the submission of this count to the jury. The Bank of Braintree check was payable to a corporate entity (American Equipment Corp.) engaged regularly in receiving payments of amounts of $35,000 or more for equipment, installation, and maintenance for use in laundromats like the one operated as Commonwealth Laundries & Cleaners, Inc., and American Equipment in fact treated it as a routine and acceptable method of payment for its furnishing and installing for this laundromat a type of upgrading equipment ordinarily required for equipment of the age of the equipment found there by American Equipment's representatives. The government's evidence received at the trial was insufficient as a matter of law to support a jury finding against defendant Carucci on the Second Element (that Carucci knew that the property involved in the transaction had been derived from some form of criminal activity). See United States v. Tramunti, 500 F.2d 1334 (2d Cir.1974) (Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29 permits judgment of acquittal based on insufficiency of evidence). This outcome is the only correct outcome if the property involved is held to be the money in the Bank of Braintree account and also if the property involved is held to be either the equipment that was upgraded or the equipment that American Equipment supplied to effect the upgrade. Thus, this court erred as a matter of law in submitting Count 70 to the jury, and the jury verdict cannot have the effect of curing the court's error of law. I take into account also the government's contention that evidence received regarding the 1992 transactions involved in Counts 73 75 served not only as evidence bearing on Counts 73 75 but also as circumstantial evidence bearing on the 1993 transactions involved in Counts 70 72. The weight of this evidence as it bears on *126 Counts 70 72, however, is very limited and is not sufficient, when added to the other evidence received in relation to Counts 70 72, to provide adequate support for a finding favorable to the government on the Second Element of the government's burden on Count 70. The banking transactions and properties involved in Counts 73 75 were exceptional rather than routine. Those exceptional qualities of the 1992 transactions have little weight as supporting an inference of knowledge or notice to defendant Carucci that anything was irregular about the 1993 transactions between Commonwealth Laundries and American Equipment, and I conclude as a matter of law that adding this limited evidence to that bearing on Count 70, considered above, as a matter of law does not overcome the government's failure to meet its burden on the Second Element of Count 70. For these reasons, the Order below sustains the defendant's Post Verdict Motion for Acquittal in Count 70. V. Count 71 Under applicable law, on Count 71 the government's burden was to prove beyond reasonable doubt each of the following three elements: First Element. The defendant engaged or attempted to engage in a monetary transaction with a value of more than $10,000. Second Element. The defendant knew that the property involved in the transaction had been derived from some form of criminal activity. Third Element. The property involved in the transaction was actually derived from specified unlawful activity. Charge to the Jury, Part III above, at page 10. See also, e.g., 18 U.S.C. 1957; United States v. Sokolow, 91 F.3d 396, 408 (3d Cir.1996); United States v. Gabriele, 63 F.3d 61, 65 (1st Cir.1995). The transaction identified in Count 71 of the Indictment was the June 11, 1993 transfer, in the amount of $15,108.18, of Bank of Braintree check # 110 (account # 146400161), payable to the order of American Equipment Corp. for the purchase of laundromat equipment by Commonwealth Laundries & Cleaners, Inc. I conclude that under applicable law the defense stated a valid objection to the submission of this count to the jury. The Bank of Braintree check was payable to a corporate entity (American Equipment Corp.) engaged regularly in receiving payments of amounts substantially larger than $15,000 for equipment, installation, and maintenance for use in laundromats like that of Commonwealth Laundries & Cleaners, Inc., and American Equipment in fact treated it as a routine and acceptable method of payment for its furnishing and installing for this laundromat a type of 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Carucci, 222 F.Supp.2d 117 (2002) upgrading equipment ordinarily required for equipment of the age of the equipment found there by American Equipment's representatives. The government's evidence received at the trial was insufficient as a matter of law to support a jury finding against defendant Carucci on the Second Element (that Carucci knew that the property involved in the transaction had been derived from some form of criminal activity). This outcome is the only correct outcome if the property involved is held to be the money in the Bank of Braintree account and also if the property involved is held to be either the equipment that was upgraded or the equipment that American Equipment supplied to effect the upgrade. Thus, this court erred as a matter of law in submitting Count 71 to the jury, and the jury verdict cannot have the effect of curing the court's error of law. I take into account also the government's contention that evidence received *127 regarding the 1992 transactions involved in Counts 73 75 served not only as evidence bearing on Counts 73 75 but also as circumstantial evidence bearing on the 1993 transactions involved in Counts 70 72. As explained in Part IV above, however, the weight of this evidence as it bears on Counts 70 72 is very limited and is not sufficient, when added to the other evidence received in relation to Count 71, to provide adequate support for a finding favorable to the government on the Second Element of the government's burden on Count 71. For these reasons, the Order below sustains the defendant's Post Verdict Motion for Acquittal in Count 71. VI. Count 72 Under applicable law, on Count 72 the government's burden was to prove beyond reasonable doubt each of the following three elements: First Element. The defendant engaged or attempted to engage in a monetary transaction with a value of more than $10,000. Second Element. The defendant knew that the property involved in the transaction had been derived from some form of criminal activity. Third Element. The property involved in the transaction was actually derived from specified unlawful activity. Charge to the Jury, Part III above, at page 10. See also, e.g., 18 U.S.C. 1957; United States v. Sokolow, 91 F.3d 396, 408 (3d Cir.1996); United States v. Gabriele, 63 F.3d 61, 65 (1st Cir.1995). The transaction identified in Count 72 of the Indictment was the June 16, 1993 transfer, in the amount of $27,461, of Bank of Braintree check # 117 (account # 146000648), payable to the order of American Equipment Corp. for the purchase of laundromat equipment by Commonwealth Laundries & Cleaners, Inc. I conclude that under applicable law the defense stated a valid objection to the submission of this count to the jury. The Bank of Braintree check was payable to a corporate entity (American Equipment Corp.) engaged regularly in receiving payments of amounts larger than $27,500 for equipment, installation, and maintenance for use in laundromats like that of Commonwealth Laundries & Cleaners, Inc., and American Equipment in fact treated it as a routine and acceptable method of payment for its furnishing and installing for this laundromat a type of upgrading equipment ordinarily required for equipment of the age of the equipment found there by American Equipment's representatives. The government's evidence received at the trial was insufficient as a matter of law to support a jury finding against defendant Carucci on the Second Element (that Carucci knew that the property involved in the transaction had been derived from some form of criminal activity). This outcome is the only correct outcome if the property involved is held to be the money in the Bank of Braintree account and also if the property involved is held to be either the equipment that was upgraded or the equipment that American Equipment supplied to effect the upgrade. Thus, this court erred as a matter of law in submitting Count 72 to the jury, and the jury verdict cannot have the effect of curing the court's error of law. I take into account also the government's contention that evidence received regarding the 1992 transactions involved in Counts 73 75 served not only as evidence bearing on Counts 73 75 but also as circumstantial evidence bearing on the 1993 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 9 \f U.S. v. Carucci, 222 F.Supp.2d 117 (2002) transactions involved in Counts 70 72. The weight of this evidence as it bears on Counts 70 72, however, is very limited and is not sufficient, when added to the other *128 evidence received in relation to Count 72, to provide adequate support for a finding favorable to the government on the Second Element of the government's burden on Count 72. For these reasons, the Order below sustains the defendant's Post Verdict Motion for Acquittal on Count 72. VII. Count 73 Under applicable law, on Count 73 the government's burden was to prove beyond reasonable doubt each of the following three elements: First Element. The defendant engaged or attempted to engage in a monetary transaction with a value of more than $10,000. Second Element. The defendant knew that the property involved in the transaction had been derived from some form of criminal activity. Third Element. The property involved in the transaction was actually derived from specified unlawful activity. Charge to the Jury, Part III above, at page 10. See also, e.g., 18 U.S.C. 1957; United States v. Sokolow, 91 F.3d 396, 408 (3d Cir.1996); United States v. Gabriele, 63 F.3d 61, 65 (1st Cir.1995). [2] The transaction identified in Count 73 of the Indictment was the December 9, 1992 transfer, in the amount of $30,500, of Mount Washington Bank check # 153453, payable to the order of Jeannette Benedetti, Trustee, Comm # 1 Realty Trust, for purchase of Unit # 1, 362 Commonwealth Avenue, Boston, Massachusetts. I conclude that under applicable law the defense objection to the submission of this count to the jury was properly overruled. Although the amount gave no notice of potential irregularity of the transaction, the identification of the account holder only by a name not generally known to the public or to persons who were bank employees or were often engaged in real estate transactions involving units in a condominium, and identified only as trustee of a Realty Trust apparently created only for the purchase and holding of one unit in a building containing condominiums, gave indications of something out of the ordinary about this transaction. I conclude that the admissible evidence before the jury in relation to this count was sufficient to support the verdict on Count 73. For these reasons, the Order below denies defendant Carucci's post-verdict motion for acquittal on Count 73. VIII. Count 74 Under applicable law, on Count 74 the government's burden was to prove beyond reasonable doubt each of the following three elements: First Element. The defendant engaged or attempted to engage in a monetary transaction with a value of more than $10,000. Second Element. The defendant knew that the property involved in the transaction had been derived from some form of criminal activity. Third Element. The property involved in the transaction was actually derived from specified unlawful activity. Charge to the Jury, Part III above, at page 10. See also, e.g., 18 U.S.C. 1957; United States v. Sokolow, 91 F.3d 396, 408 (3d Cir.1996); United States v. Gabriele, 63 F.3d 61, 65 (1st Cir.1995). [3] The transaction identified in Count 74 of the Indictment was the December 9, 1992 transfer, in the amount of $16,408.37, of Winter Hill Federal Savings Bank check # 449778014, payable to the order of Summers and Summers, for purchase of Unit # 1, 362 Commonwealth Avenue, Boston, Massachusetts. *129 I conclude that under applicable law the defense stated a valid objection to the submission of this count to the jury. The Winter Hill Federal Savings Bank check was payable to a law firm engaged regularly in receiving payments of amounts larger than $27,500 for the purchase of real estate for residential use and for use in businesses like that of Commonwealth Laundries & Cleaners, Inc., and Summers 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 10 \f U.S. v. Carucci, 222 F.Supp.2d 117 (2002) and Summers in fact treated it as a routine and acceptable method of payment. The government's evidence received at the trial was insufficient as a matter of law to support a jury finding against defendant Carucci on the Second Element (that Carucci knew that the property involved in the transaction had been derived from some form of criminal activity). This outcome is the only correct outcome if the property involved is held to be the money in the Winter Hill Federal Savings Bank account and also if the property involved is held to be either the equipment that was upgraded or the equipment that American Equipment supplied to effect the upgrade. Thus, this court erred as a matter of law in submitting Count 74 to the jury, and the jury verdict cannot have the effect of curing the court's error of law. I take into account also the government's contention that the fact that the account was in a Winter Hill entity gave indications of something out of the ordinary about the transaction. I conclude that the fact that a federally insured banking institution was located in the same area that Flemmi and James Bulger operated a criminal enterprise and that the criminal enterprise coincidentally shared part of its name with the banking institution does not indicate that every or any check drawn on that institution is related to any criminal enterprise or is otherwise out of the ordinary. For these reasons, the Order below sustains the defendant's Post Verdict Motion for Acquittal on Count 74. IX. Count 75 Under applicable law, on Count 75 the government's burden was to prove beyond reasonable doubt each of the following three elements: First Element. The defendant engaged or attempted to engage in a monetary transaction with a value of more than $10,000. Second Element. The defendant knew that the property involved in the transaction had been derived from some form of criminal activity. Third Element. The property involved in the transaction was actually derived from specified unlawful activity. Charge to the Jury, Part III above, at page 10. See also, e.g., 18 U.S.C. 1957; United States v. Sokolow, 91 F.3d 396, 408 (3d Cir.1996); United States v. Gabriele, 63 F.3d 61, 65 (1st Cir.1995). The transaction identified in Count 75 of the Indictment was the December 9, 1992 transfer, in the amount of $70,000 of Hyde Park Savings Bank check # 61 074013040, payable to the order of Jeannette Benedetti, for purchase of Unit # 1, 362 Commonwealth Avenue, Boston, Massachusetts. I conclude that under applicable law the defense objection to the submission of this count to the jury was properly overruled. Although the amount gave no notice of potential irregularity of the transaction, the identification of the account holder only by a name not generally known to the public or to persons who were bank employees or were often engaged in real estate transactions involving units in a condominium, and that it was the same name as that involved in Count 72, gave indications of something out of the ordinary about this transaction. *130 I conclude that the admissible evidence before the jury in relation to this count was sufficient to support the verdict on Count 75. For these reasons, the Order below denies defendant Carucci's post-verdict motion for acquittal on Count 75. X. The Defense Contention on Concealment [4] In the Charge Conference of April 5, 2002, and again in the defendant Carucci's objections to the charge after it was given and before the jury commenced deliberations, defendant Carucci objected to the submission of any count to the jury on grounds of government misconduct. See Part III A, above, of this Memorandum. This defense contention is that the court should have dismissed the indictment and that, having failed to do so before verdict, the court should now dismiss all counts on which the jury returned verdicts of guilty. 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 11 \f U.S. v. Carucci, 222 F.Supp.2d 117 (2002) I find that government misconduct did occur, in the form of unwarranted overcharging. But in view of the rulings made on other aspects of Carucci's post-verdict motions, for the reasons explained in this Memorandum, I conclude that dismissal would be an unwarranted sanction, intruding upon the public's interest in proceedings fair and appropriate for protection of the public's interest as well as the interests of the United States Attorney and his assistants in prosecution and the defense interests in fair trial. See, e.g., United States v. Font Ramirez, 944 F.2d 42, 46 (1st Cir.1991) ( Even where misconduct is present, post-conviction dismissal of an indictment is a rare event ... ). make a conditional ruling on his motion for a new trial in Docket Number 261 at page 18. [5] Because I find, as state in Part IX above, that prosecutorial misconduct did occur, and that the weight of the evidence does not support the verdict, as I state in Parts IV, V, VI, and VIII, I conclude that if the judgment of acquittal I order below is hereafter vacated or reversed a new trial should be granted for the reasons stated in those parts. See, e.g., United States v. Dixon, 658 F.2d 181, 193 (3d Cir.1981) (noting that court may grant a *131 new trial for prosecutorial misconduct or insufficiency of evidence). Remaining for consideration is whether the court should invoke the lesser sanction of allowing a new trial on Counts 73 and 75, which the defendant has requested under Rule 33 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. I do not consider defendant's request for a new trial on Count 74 because I allow defendant's motion for judgment of acquittal on that count. Although I reach this conclusion based on the combination of these two factors, I also conclude that if the judgment of acquittal I order below is hereafter vacated or reversed a new trial should be granted based solely on the fact that the verdict on Counts 70, 71, 72, and 74 is not supported by the weight of the evidence. Defendant Carucci argues that a new trial is appropriate because the government, in its summation, improperly invited the jury to rely on acquitted conduct. (Docket No. 287). Specifically, the defendant asserts that the government's references in its summation to the 238 Marlborough Street transactions was improper. I find that, although the government skirted close to the demarcation between propriety and impropriety, it did not cross it, at least in its summation. Although a court may order a new trial on the basis of prosecutorial misconduct, Luttrell v. United States, 320 F.2d 462 (5th Cir.1963), I conclude that the misconduct in this case in the form of unwarranted overcharging does not by itself warrant a new trial on Counts 73 and 75. XI. Conditional Motion for New Trial Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29(d) requires this court, if it allows a motion for judgment of acquittal, to also determine whether any motion for a new trial should be granted if the judgment of acquittal is thereafter vacated or reversed, specifying the grounds for such determination. Defendant Carucci requested that the court For these reasons, the Order below allows the defendant Carucci's conditional motion for a new trial. ORDER For the foregoing reasons, it is ORDERED: (1) Defendant's Post Verdict Motion for Judgment of Acquittal (Docket No. 261) (a) is SUSTAINED as to Counts 70, 71, 72, and 74; and (b) is DENIED as to Counts 73 and 75. (2) The defendant Carucci's motion for new trial on Counts 73 and 75 is DENIED. (3) The defendant Carucci's conditional motion for new trial on Counts 70, 71, 72, and 74 is ALLOWED.

No. CRIM.97 10060 REK. | Aug. 15, 2002. Jury returned guilty verdict on six federal counts of engaging in transactions in criminally derived property. Defendant moved for judgment of acquittal and for new trial. The District Court, Keeton, J., held that: (1) evidence was insufficient to satisfy knowledge element as to four of six subject transactions that bore no indicia of being out of the ordinary; (2) evidence was sufficient to satisfy knowledge element as to remaining two counts involving insufficiently identified bank account holder; (3) prosecutorial misconduct, consisting of overcharging, did not warrant dismissal of two remaining counts or new trial on those counts.

(Docket No. 1, filed March 11, 1997). the indictment were Money Laundering Concluding Forfeiture Allegations and Racketeering Forfeiture Allegations, the practical effect of which was to deprive both defendants of access to their respective interests in numerous real estate parcels and bank accounts, regardless of whether or not the government would be able to prove its charges at trial. The indictment also alleged that Stephen J. Flemmi had been involved continuously since the 1960s ... in organized crime within the District of Massachusetts and elsewhere and during the 1970s acted in a supervisory position in a criminal organization known by various names, including The Winter Hill Gang and South Boston.

Bulger became the leaders of the Winter Hill Gang. The defendant STEPHEN J. FLEMMI has remained a leader of the Winter Hill Gang up to the date of this indictment. Id.

(e) Between approximately 1991 and the present, the defendant MICHAEL L. CARUCCI has participated in multiple business and real estate ventures with the defendant STEPHEN J. FLEMMI, as the defendant FLEMMI's partner and otherwise. Id. B. Availability of Prompt Trial The judge to whom this case was randomly drawn under the court's assignment system was available to try the charges in this case against both defendants together, or against them separately in sequence, as appropriate, during the period provided by law for speedy trial in the absence of excludable time apart from that incident to severance, if severance had been determined to be appropriate. It was approximately five years before any part of the case came to trial. Trial commenced with jury selection on March 11, 12, and 14, 2002, on 100 of 103 Counts, and against defendant Carucci only. The court at all times after indictment in 1997 had been prepared to try the case promptly upon its being ready for trial. For a period of a few months the originally assigned judge would have been unavailable because of major surgery, and the case would then have been tried before another judge of the court. But the originally assigned judge was again available before any part of the case was ready for trial. C. The Pattern of Delay On the full record that is now before me in this case, I find that the United States Attorney for the District of Massachusetts and the Assistant United States Attorneys to whom he assigned responsibility for prosecution of this case chose not to seek a prompt trial. Either according to an initial plan or by a series of decisions as circumstances associated with the case developed, they preferred to delay trial for approximately five years. Each of the defendants also had his own distinctive reasons for preferring delay over prompt trial. 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 3 \f U.S. v. Carucci, 222 F.Supp.2d 117 (2002) Thus, all parties requested extensions of time on grounds the court found acceptable and consistent with excludable-time provisions of rules regarding speedy trial rights of the public and the parties. D. Status of the Case at Time of Impanelment When the government eventually declared it was ready to proceed with trial, it was barred from proceeding with the trial against defendant Stephen J. Flemmi under a plea agreement in United States v. Stephen J. Flemmi, Criminal Number 94 10287 MLW, a case in which the indictment also included allegations of money laundering and conspiracy to commit money laundering. (See United States' Motion to Dismiss Indictment with Respect to Defendant Stephen J. Flemmi, Docket No. 186, filed March 18, 2002; the court allowed that motion by an endorsement on its margin on March 19, 2002). Before the trial commenced, the court concluded also that discovery requests and motions to dismiss all or at least some counts of the indictment against the defendant Michael L. Carucci, ultimately determined to be meritorious at least in part, *121 had to be heard and decided before the court could properly submit the case to the jury that was impaneled on March 11, 12, and 14, 2002. The court denied the requests that the court hold an evidentiary hearing and make its decision on whether it would submit the conspiracy charges against Michael L. Carucci before impaneling a jury. The court gave notice that instead it would follow the practice of making its final decision on that matter after the close of all the evidence, as approved and directed by the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in, among other cases, United States v. Ciampaglia, 628 F.2d 632, 638 (1st Cir.1980), and United States v. Bradshaw, 281 F.3d 278, 284 (1st Cir.2002). Because the government still had not disclosed admissible evidence sufficient for the case to go to the jury against defendant Michael L. Carucci on either of the two conspiracy Counts, the court warned government counsel that it would allow a mistrial if requested by defendant Carucci on adequately supported grounds that the government had withheld evidence that it should have disclosed in advance of trial and in fact disclosed only during trial, and that if the government did not produce during trial admissible evidence sufficient to close the gaps in the governments's advance proffer of evidence to show that Carucci had knowingly become a member of a conspiracy charged against him, the court expected to direct acquittal at least on the conspiracy counts and possibly on substantive counts on which the court had declined to direct acquittal before impanelment but with notice that it would consider on the merits, count by count, after the close of evidence and before submission to the jury, the defense motion for acquittal because of the government's failure to persuade the court that it had a valid legal theory, supported by adequate evidence for submission of each particular count to the jury. E. Order of Acquittal on Specified Counts Before Submission of Other Counts to the Jury Near the conclusion of the Rule 29 Hearing, on April 4, 2002, the court stated and explained its order of acquittal on Counts 1, 14 66, 76 103. (Transcript of Rule 29 Hearing of April 4, 2002, Docket No. 263, at pp. 30 33). As noted before, Carucci was not charged in Counts 67 69. Thus, the counts remaining to be submitted to the jury were Counts 2 13 and 70 75. See id. at p. 33. F. Verdict In the Verdict received on April 16, 2002, the jury found the defendant: NOT GUILTY on Counts 2 13, and GUILTY on Counts 70 75. (Verdict, Docket No. 258). III. Applicable Law A. Reservations Stated by the Court in the Charge Conference In the Charge Conference of April 5, 2002, very helpful suggestions of counsel for the government and the defendant clarified issues that had been troubling in earlier hearings. With the benefit of these suggestions, the court was then and still is now satisfied that the charge given to the jury correctly states the law on nearly all of the issues addressed. 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 4 \f U.S. v. Carucci, 222 F.Supp.2d 117 (2002) On a few of the objections then made and later stated by defense counsel, after the charge was given to the jury and before they commenced deliberations, I expressed my concern and gave notice of my willingness to reconsider afresh in post-verdict proceedings any matters essential to deciding what rulings I should make on post-verdict motions. These matters are *122 identified in the Transcript of the Charge Conference (Docket No. 264). (1) One issue of ongoing concern was whether the government had advanced or could advance any valid legal theory of conspiracy together with a proffer of admissible evidence sufficient to support a finding of a conspiracy that defendant Carucci had manifested agreement to becoming a member of the conspiracy. See defense counsel's argument, id. at 3 6, and my response, id. at 6 7. (2) Another issue concerned whether the government had advanced or could advance, for each substantive count, any viable legal theory together with a proffer of admissible evidence sufficient to support a jury finding of each of the elements of the substantive offense identified by that legal theory beyond reasonable doubt. issues concerning whether Among the subsidiary issues bearing on particular counts were the government had proffered or ever could proffer admissible evidence sufficient to support a finding that profits from any of the alleged unlawful activities ended up in bank accounts upon which checks to American Equipment, produced by Flemmi individually or through the Mary Irene Trust, were drawn. Id. at 24. Another subsidiary issue concerned whether Flemmi's daughter, Jeannette Benedetti, or others in the family, gave to RECOLL Management funds derived from identifiable unlawful activities for the purchase of a condominium from or through RECOLL Management. See defense counsel's argument, id. at 3 6, and my response, id. at 6 7. Another subsidiary issue concerned causal connection. Defendant agreed that the government was not required under 18 U.S.C. 1956 to trace proceeds of a particular sale (or other transaction) to a particular specified unlawful activity, id. at 24, but argued that the government had to show some causal connection between an identifiable unlawful activity and bank funds used in the transaction charged in a particular count, id. at 3, 24. (3) Another set of issues concerned the instructions on willful blindness. See id. at 20 24. (4) Another set of issues concerned the defense contention of government misconduct by concealment, id. at 31, and the defense contention that one or more counts should be dismissed by application of a legal test for dismissal of charges in an indictment under a factors analysis, id. at 32 33. (5) Another set of issues concerned the use and meaning in various contexts of the word willfully, id., at 34 36, 39. (6) Another set of issues concerned the defense contention that the government had proffered no admissible evidence, direct or circumstantial, that Flemmi collected extortionate extensions of credit, id. at 49 52. B. Applicable Law as Stated in the Charge to the Jury Excerpts from the Charge to the Jury that are potentially relevant to issues remaining for decision on post-verdict motions are recited here: The charges submitted to you are in Counts 2 13 and 70 75 of the indictment. . . . . . Counts 70 75 charge that the defendant Michael Carucci, along with Stephen Flemmi, knowingly violated the statute prohibiting monetary transactions in criminally derived property, with a value of over $10,000, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1957. The defendant contends that he did not know that any of the funds involved in the purchase of the commercial condominium at 362 Commonwealth Avenue, *123 the equipment from Commonwealth Laundry, or the services from Mr. Heat derived from any unlawful activity by Stephen Flemmi. He instead believed that the funds used by Flemmi or his family were legitimate funds derived from bank accounts. Even if you believe that Mr. Carucci was aware that Flemmi's reputation was not favorable, absent proof beyond a reasonable doubt that he knew that the 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 5 \f U.S. v. Carucci, 222 F.Supp.2d 117 (2002) funds for the specific transactions that are the subject of Counts 2 13 and 70 75 derived from Flemmi's unlawful activity then Mr. Carucci is entitled to an acquittal on all counts. . . . . . Counts 70 75 of the indictment contain allegations of acts by defendant Michael Carucci and others that constitute transactions in criminally derived property in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1957. Title 18, Section 1957(a) of the United States Code provides, in pertinent part, that: Whoever ... knowingly engages or attempts to engage in a monetary transaction in criminally derived property that is of a value greater than $10,000 and is derived from specified unlawful activity ... shall be guilty of an offense against the United States. In order to prove a violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1957, the government must prove the following three elements beyond a reasonable doubt: First Element. The defendant engaged or attempted to engage in a monetary transaction with a value of more than $10,000. Second Element. The defendant knew that the property involved in the transaction had been derived from some form of criminal activity. Third Element. The property involved in the transaction was actually derived from specified unlawful activity. First Eement. To satisfy the first element, the government must prove that the defendant knowingly engaged in, or attempted to engage in, a monetary transaction involving property of a value greater than $10,000. A monetary transaction is the deposit, withdrawal, transfer, or exchange, in or affecting interstate commerce, of funds or a monetary instrument by, through, or to a financial institution. I have previously defined for you the terms monetary instrument and financial institution. Thus, the transaction must involve three things: First, it must be in, or have some minimal relationship to, interstate commerce. Second, it must be by, through, or to a financial institution. For example, drawing a check on a bank account would satisfy this requirement. Third, the property involved must have a value greater than $10,000. Second Element. To prove the second element, the government must show that the defendant knew that the money involved in the transaction was criminally derived property. Criminally derived property includes any property constituting or derived from proceeds of criminal activity. This means that the property must have been obtained from some previous, separate criminal action. The government is only required to show that the defendant knew that the property was derived from some form of criminal activity. It does not have to prove that the defendant knew what particular type of criminal act produced the property. *124 In order to prove the element of knowledge, the government must show that the defendant actually knew that the property was derived from criminal activity. It is not sufficient for the government to show that the defendant might have known or should have known. In determining whether the defendant knew that the property was derived from criminal activity, the jury must make a decision about the defendant's state of mind at the time of the transaction. It is impossible to prove this directly, because the jury cannot look into the defendant's mind. Therefore, you may rely on circumstantial evidence in making this determination. You should consider all the facts and circumstances shown in the evidence in order to infer with a reasonable degree of accuracy what the defendant's state of mind was. In deciding whether the defendant acted knowingly, you may infer that the defendant had knowledge that the property involved in the transaction was derived from criminal activity if you find that he deliberately closed his eyes to the fact that otherwise would have been obvious to 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 6 \f U.S. v. Carucci, 222 F.Supp.2d 117 (2002) him. It is for the jury to decide whether the defendant was willfully blind to the fact that the property was criminally derived and, if so, what inference should be drawn. It is important, however, to bear in mind that mere negligence or mistake in failing to learn that the property was derived from criminal activity is not sufficient. The government is not required to prove that the defendant knew that the transaction involving criminally derived property was itself an illegal act. In other words, although the defendant must know that the property was derived from criminal acts, the law does not require that he be aware that the transaction involving that property was a separate illegal act. Third Element. To prove the third element of the offense, the government must show that the property involved in the transaction was actually derived from specified criminal activity. Specified criminal activity refers to crimes included in a list of offenses included in the statute. I have already instructed you on the specified unlawful activity alleged in the indictment. It is for the jury to decide whether the government has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the property involved in the transaction was actually derived from the criminal activities just mentioned. In proving the third element, it is not necessary for the government to show that all of the property involved in the transaction was derived from the criminal activity. The government can meet its burden of proof even if some of the involved property was derived from lawful sources and was commingled with the criminally derived property in the transaction, so long as the government proves beyond reasonable doubt that at least $10,000 of each monetary transaction was derived from specified unlawful activity. In determining whether the property involved in a transaction was derived from specified criminal activity, you may consider circumstantial evidence insofar as it would support common sense inferences based on the realities of human experience. As already mentioned, the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant knew that the property involved in the transaction was derived from criminal activity. The government, however, does not need to show that the defendant knew that the property was derived from any *125 of the offenses that qualify as specified criminal activity. All that is required is knowledge that the property was produced by some form of unlawful action. I am sending a copy of the relevant portion of the indictment into the jury room for you to have during your deliberations. You may use it to read the crimes which the defendant is charged with committing. You are reminded, however, that an indictment is merely an accusation and is not to be used by you as any proof of the conduct charged. (Charge to the Jury, Docket No. 305 at 17, 45 49). IV. Count 70 Under applicable law, on Count 70 the government's burden was to prove beyond reasonable doubt each of the following three elements: First Element. The defendant engaged or attempted to engage in a monetary transaction with a value of more than $10,000. Second Element. The defendant knew that the property involved in the transaction had been derived from some form of criminal activity. Third Element. The property involved in the transaction was actually derived from specified unlawful activity. Charge to the Jury, Part III above, at page 10. See also, e.g., 18 U.S.C. 1957; United States v. Sokolow, 91 F.3d 396, 408 (3d Cir.1996); United States v. Gabriele, 63 F.3d 61, 65 (1st Cir.1995). [1] The transaction identified in Count 70 of the Indictment was the June 4, 1993 transfer, in the amount of $35,883, of Bank of Braintree check # 108 (account # 146400161), payable to the order of American Equipment Corp. for the purchase of laundromat equipment by Commonwealth Laundries & Cleaners, Inc. 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 7 \f U.S. v. Carucci, 222 F.Supp.2d 117 (2002) I conclude that under applicable law the defense stated a valid objection to the submission of this count to the jury. The Bank of Braintree check was payable to a corporate entity (American Equipment Corp.) engaged regularly in receiving payments of amounts of $35,000 or more for equipment, installation, and maintenance for use in laundromats like the one operated as Commonwealth Laundries & Cleaners, Inc., and American Equipment in fact treated it as a routine and acceptable method of payment for its furnishing and installing for this laundromat a type of upgrading equipment ordinarily required for equipment of the age of the equipment found there by American Equipment's representatives. The government's evidence received at the trial was insufficient as a matter of law to support a jury finding against defendant Carucci on the Second Element (that Carucci knew that the property involved in the transaction had been derived from some form of criminal activity). See United States v. Tramunti, 500 F.2d 1334 (2d Cir.1974) (Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29 permits judgment of acquittal based on insufficiency of evidence). This outcome is the only correct outcome if the property involved is held to be the money in the Bank of Braintree account and also if the property involved is held to be either the equipment that was upgraded or the equipment that American Equipment supplied to effect the upgrade. Thus, this court erred as a matter of law in submitting Count 70 to the jury, and the jury verdict cannot have the effect of curing the court's error of law. I take into account also the government's contention that evidence received regarding the 1992 transactions involved in Counts 73 75 served not only as evidence bearing on Counts 73 75 but also as circumstantial evidence bearing on the 1993 transactions involved in Counts 70 72. The weight of this evidence as it bears on *126 Counts 70 72, however, is very limited and is not sufficient, when added to the other evidence received in relation to Counts 70 72, to provide adequate support for a finding favorable to the government on the Second Element of the government's burden on Count 70. The banking transactions and properties involved in Counts 73 75 were exceptional rather than routine. Those exceptional qualities of the 1992 transactions have little weight as supporting an inference of knowledge or notice to defendant Carucci that anything was irregular about the 1993 transactions between Commonwealth Laundries and American Equipment, and I conclude as a matter of law that adding this limited evidence to that bearing on Count 70, considered above, as a matter of law does not overcome the government's failure to meet its burden on the Second Element of Count 70. For these reasons, the Order below sustains the defendant's Post Verdict Motion for Acquittal in Count 70. V. Count 71 Under applicable law, on Count 71 the government's burden was to prove beyond reasonable doubt each of the following three elements: First Element. The defendant engaged or attempted to engage in a monetary transaction with a value of more than $10,000. Second Element. The defendant knew that the property involved in the transaction had been derived from some form of criminal activity. Third Element. The property involved in the transaction was actually derived from specified unlawful activity. Charge to the Jury, Part III above, at page 10. See also, e.g., 18 U.S.C. 1957; United States v. Sokolow, 91 F.3d 396, 408 (3d Cir.1996); United States v. Gabriele, 63 F.3d 61, 65 (1st Cir.1995). The transaction identified in Count 71 of the Indictment was the June 11, 1993 transfer, in the amount of $15,108.18, of Bank of Braintree check # 110 (account # 146400161), payable to the order of American Equipment Corp. for the purchase of laundromat equipment by Commonwealth Laundries & Cleaners, Inc. I conclude that under applicable law the defense stated a valid objection to the submission of this count to the jury. The Bank of Braintree check was payable to a corporate entity (American Equipment Corp.) engaged regularly in receiving payments of amounts substantially larger than $15,000 for equipment, installation, and maintenance for use in laundromats like that of Commonwealth Laundries & Cleaners, Inc., and American Equipment in fact treated it as a routine and acceptable method of payment for its furnishing and installing for this laundromat a type of 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Carucci, 222 F.Supp.2d 117 (2002) upgrading equipment ordinarily required for equipment of the age of the equipment found there by American Equipment's representatives. The government's evidence received at the trial was insufficient as a matter of law to support a jury finding against defendant Carucci on the Second Element (that Carucci knew that the property involved in the transaction had been derived from some form of criminal activity). This outcome is the only correct outcome if the property involved is held to be the money in the Bank of Braintree account and also if the property involved is held to be either the equipment that was upgraded or the equipment that American Equipment supplied to effect the upgrade. Thus, this court erred as a matter of law in submitting Count 71 to the jury, and the jury verdict cannot have the effect of curing the court's error of law. I take into account also the government's contention that evidence received *127 regarding the 1992 transactions involved in Counts 73 75 served not only as evidence bearing on Counts 73 75 but also as circumstantial evidence bearing on the 1993 transactions involved in Counts 70 72. As explained in Part IV above, however, the weight of this evidence as it bears on Counts 70 72 is very limited and is not sufficient, when added to the other evidence received in relation to Count 71, to provide adequate support for a finding favorable to the government on the Second Element of the government's burden on Count 71. For these reasons, the Order below sustains the defendant's Post Verdict Motion for Acquittal in Count 71. VI. Count 72 Under applicable law, on Count 72 the government's burden was to prove beyond reasonable doubt each of the following three elements: First Element. The defendant engaged or attempted to engage in a monetary transaction with a value of more than $10,000. Second Element. The defendant knew that the property involved in the transaction had been derived from some form of criminal activity. Third Element. The property involved in the transaction was actually derived from specified unlawful activity. Charge to the Jury, Part III above, at page 10. See also, e.g., 18 U.S.C. 1957; United States v. Sokolow, 91 F.3d 396, 408 (3d Cir.1996); United States v. Gabriele, 63 F.3d 61, 65 (1st Cir.1995). The transaction identified in Count 72 of the Indictment was the June 16, 1993 transfer, in the amount of $27,461, of Bank of Braintree check # 117 (account # 146000648), payable to the order of American Equipment Corp. for the purchase of laundromat equipment by Commonwealth Laundries & Cleaners, Inc. I conclude that under applicable law the defense stated a valid objection to the submission of this count to the jury. The Bank of Braintree check was payable to a corporate entity (American Equipment Corp.) engaged regularly in receiving payments of amounts larger than $27,500 for equipment, installation, and maintenance for use in laundromats like that of Commonwealth Laundries & Cleaners, Inc., and American Equipment in fact treated it as a routine and acceptable method of payment for its furnishing and installing for this laundromat a type of upgrading equipment ordinarily required for equipment of the age of the equipment found there by American Equipment's representatives.

The weight of this evidence as it bears on Counts 70 72, however, is very limited and is not sufficient, when added to the other *128 evidence received in relation to Count 72, to provide adequate support for a finding favorable to the government on the Second Element of the government's burden on Count 72. For these reasons, the Order below sustains the defendant's Post Verdict Motion for Acquittal on Count 72. VII. Count 73 Under applicable law, on Count 73 the government's burden was to prove beyond reasonable doubt each of the following three elements: First Element. The defendant engaged or attempted to engage in a monetary transaction with a value of more than $10,000. Second Element. The defendant knew that the property involved in the transaction had been derived from some form of criminal activity. Third Element. The property involved in the transaction was actually derived from specified unlawful activity. Charge to the Jury, Part III above, at page 10. See also, e.g., 18 U.S.C. 1957; United States v. Sokolow, 91 F.3d 396, 408 (3d Cir.1996); United States v. Gabriele, 63 F.3d 61, 65 (1st Cir.1995). [2] The transaction identified in Count 73 of the Indictment was the December 9, 1992 transfer, in the amount of $30,500, of Mount Washington Bank check # 153453, payable to the order of Jeannette Benedetti, Trustee, Comm # 1 Realty Trust, for purchase of Unit # 1, 362 Commonwealth Avenue, Boston, Massachusetts. I conclude that under applicable law the defense objection to the submission of this count to the jury was properly overruled. Although the amount gave no notice of potential irregularity of the transaction, the identification of the account holder only by a name not generally known to the public or to persons who were bank employees or were often engaged in real estate transactions involving units in a condominium, and identified only as trustee of a Realty Trust apparently created only for the purchase and holding of one unit in a building containing condominiums, gave indications of something out of the ordinary about this transaction. I conclude that the admissible evidence before the jury in relation to this count was sufficient to support the verdict on Count 73. For these reasons, the Order below denies defendant Carucci's post-verdict motion for acquittal on Count 73. VIII. Count 74 Under applicable law, on Count 74 the government's burden was to prove beyond reasonable doubt each of the following three elements: First Element. The defendant engaged or attempted to engage in a monetary transaction with a value of more than $10,000. Second Element. The defendant knew that the property involved in the transaction had been derived from some form of criminal activity. Third Element. The property involved in the transaction was actually derived from specified unlawful activity. Charge to the Jury, Part III above, at page 10. See also, e.g., 18 U.S.C. 1957; United States v.

[3] The transaction identified in Count 74 of the Indictment was the December 9, 1992 transfer, in the amount of $16,408.37, of Winter Hill Federal Savings Bank check # 449778014, payable to the order of Summers and Summers, for purchase of Unit # 1, 362 Commonwealth Avenue, Boston, Massachusetts. *129 I conclude that under applicable law the defense stated a valid objection to the submission of this count to the jury. The Winter Hill Federal Savings Bank check was payable to a law firm engaged regularly in receiving payments of amounts larger than $27,500 for the purchase of real estate for residential use and for use in businesses like that of Commonwealth Laundries & Cleaners, Inc., and Summers 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 10 \f U.S. v. Carucci, 222 F.Supp.2d 117 (2002) and Summers in fact treated it as a routine and acceptable method of payment. The government's evidence received at the trial was insufficient as a matter of law to support a jury finding against defendant Carucci on the Second Element (that Carucci knew that the property involved in the transaction had been derived from some form of criminal activity). This outcome is the only correct outcome if the property involved is held to be the money in the Winter Hill Federal Savings Bank account and also if the property involved is held to be either the equipment that was upgraded or the equipment that American Equipment supplied to effect the upgrade. Thus, this court erred as a matter of law in submitting Count 74 to the jury, and the jury verdict cannot have the effect of curing the court's error of law. I take into account also the government's contention that the fact that the account was in a Winter Hill entity gave indications of something out of the ordinary about the transaction. I conclude that the fact that a federally insured banking institution was located in the same area that Flemmi and James Bulger operated a criminal enterprise and that the criminal enterprise coincidentally shared part of its name with the banking institution does not indicate that every or any check drawn on that institution is related to any criminal enterprise or is otherwise out of the ordinary. For these reasons, the Order below sustains the defendant's Post Verdict Motion for Acquittal on Count 74. IX. Count 75 Under applicable law, on Count 75 the government's burden was to prove beyond reasonable doubt each of the following three elements: First Element. The defendant engaged or attempted to engage in a monetary transaction with a value of more than $10,000. Second Element. The defendant knew that the property involved in the transaction had been derived from some form of criminal activity. Third Element. The property involved in the transaction was actually derived from specified unlawful activity. Charge to the Jury, Part III above, at page 10. See also, e.g., 18 U.S.C. 1957; United States v.

The transaction identified in Count 75 of the Indictment was the December 9, 1992 transfer, in the amount of $70,000 of Hyde Park Savings Bank check # 61 074013040, payable to the order of Jeannette Benedetti, for purchase of Unit # 1, 362 Commonwealth Avenue, Boston, Massachusetts. I conclude that under applicable law the defense objection to the submission of this count to the jury was properly overruled. Although the amount gave no notice of potential irregularity of the transaction, the identification of the account holder only by a name not generally known to the public or to persons who were bank employees or were often engaged in real estate transactions involving units in a condominium, and that it was the same name as that involved in Count 72, gave indications of something out of the ordinary about this transaction. *130 I conclude that the admissible evidence before the jury in relation to this count was sufficient to support the verdict on Count 75. For these reasons, the Order below denies defendant Carucci's post-verdict motion for acquittal on Count 75. X. The Defense Contention on Concealment [4] In the Charge Conference of April 5, 2002, and again in the defendant Carucci's objections to the charge after it was given and before the jury commenced deliberations, defendant Carucci objected to the submission of any count to the jury on grounds of government misconduct. See Part III A, above, of this Memorandum. This defense contention is that the court should have dismissed the indictment and that, having failed to do so before verdict, the court should now dismiss all counts on which the jury returned verdicts of guilty. 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 11 \f U.S. v. Carucci, 222 F.Supp.2d 117 (2002) I find that government misconduct did occur, in the form of unwarranted overcharging. But in view of the rulings made on other aspects of Carucci's post-verdict motions, for the reasons explained in this Memorandum, I conclude that dismissal would be an unwarranted sanction, intruding upon the public's interest in proceedings fair and appropriate for protection of the public's interest as well as the interests of the United States Attorney and his assistants in prosecution and the defense interests in fair trial. See, e.g., United States v. Font Ramirez, 944 F.2d 42, 46 (1st Cir.1991) ( Even where misconduct is present, post-conviction dismissal of an indictment is a rare event ... ). make a conditional ruling on his motion for a new trial in Docket Number 261 at page 18. [5] Because I find, as state in Part IX above, that prosecutorial misconduct did occur, and that the weight of the evidence does not support the verdict, as I state in Parts IV, V, VI, and VIII, I conclude that if the judgment of acquittal I order below is hereafter vacated or reversed a new trial should be granted for the reasons stated in those parts. See, e.g., United States v. Dixon, 658 F.2d 181, 193 (3d Cir.1981) (noting that court may grant a *131 new trial for prosecutorial misconduct or insufficiency of evidence). Remaining for consideration is whether the court should invoke the lesser sanction of allowing a new trial on Counts 73 and 75, which the defendant has requested under Rule 33 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. I do not consider defendant's request for a new trial on Count 74 because I allow defendant's motion for judgment of acquittal on that count. Although I reach this conclusion based on the combination of these two factors, I also conclude that if the judgment of acquittal I order below is hereafter vacated or reversed a new trial should be granted based solely on the fact that the verdict on Counts 70, 71, 72, and 74 is not supported by the weight of the evidence. Defendant Carucci argues that a new trial is appropriate because the government, in its summation, improperly invited the jury to rely on acquitted conduct. (Docket No. 287). Specifically, the defendant asserts that the government's references in its summation to the 238 Marlborough Street transactions was improper. I find that, although the government skirted close to the demarcation between propriety and impropriety, it did not cross it, at least in its summation. Although a court may order a new trial on the basis of prosecutorial misconduct, Luttrell v. United States, 320 F.2d 462 (5th Cir.1963), I conclude that the misconduct in this case in the form of unwarranted overcharging does not by itself warrant a new trial on Counts 73 and 75. XI. Conditional Motion for New Trial Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29(d) requires this court, if it allows a motion for judgment of acquittal, to also determine whether any motion for a new trial should be granted if the judgment of acquittal is thereafter vacated or reversed, specifying the grounds for such determination. Defendant Carucci requested that the court For these reasons, the Order below allows the defendant Carucci's conditional motion for a new trial. ORDER For the foregoing reasons, it is ORDERED: (1) Defendant's Post Verdict Motion for Judgment of Acquittal (Docket No. 261) (a) is SUSTAINED as to Counts 70, 71, 72, and 74; and (b) is DENIED as to Counts 73 and 75. (2) The defendant Carucci's motion for new trial on Counts 73 and 75 is DENIED. (3) The defendant Carucci's conditional motion for new trial on Counts 70, 71, 72, and 74 is ALLOWED. (4) A Case Management Conference is set for September 5, 2002, at 10:00 a.m. to consider the schedule for a sentencing hearing and final disposition on Counts 73 and 75. 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Castetter, Assistant U.S., Office of the U.S. Attorney, San Diego, CA, for Plaintiff Appellee. Kristi A. Hughes, Vincent James Brunkow, Federal Defenders of San Diego, Inc., San Diego, CA, for Defendant Appellant. Appeal from the United States District Court for the Southern District of California, Anthony J. Battaglia, District Judge, Presiding. D.C. No. 3:11 cr 03639 AJB 1. Before: SCHROEDER, PREGERSON, and NGUYEN, Circuit Judges. MEMORANDUM * Jonathan Cruz ( Cruz ) was found guilty of importing 9.84 kilograms of marijuana and 4.50 kilograms of methamphetamine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. 952 and 960, and sentenced to the mandatory minimum sentence of ten years. Cruz appeals his *624 conviction and sentence. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. 1291. Because we reverse Cruz's conviction for prosecutorial misconduct, we do not reach his other issues. We review prosecutorial misconduct claims for plain error where defense counsel failed to object before the district court. United States v. Reyes, 660 F.3d 454, 461 (9th Cir.2011). Under plain error review, we will reverse Cruz's conviction only if the prosecutor's statements were improper and the statements resulted in substantial prejudice. United States v. Sanchez, 659 F.3d 1252, 1256 (9th Cir.2011). In rebuttal, the prosecutor argued [Cruz] is guilty of what he is charged with. Find him guilty and do the right thing and make him finally take responsibility for what he did. By stating do the right thing the prosecutor improperly expressed his personal opinion to the jury. See United States v. McKoy, 771 F.2d 1207, 1210 11 (9th Cir.1985). Without reference to the evidence or the burden of proof, the do the right thing statement improperly urged the jury to convict on the basis of the prosecutor's subjective belief of what was right, as opposed to the persuasive force of the evidence. See Sanchez, 659 F.3d at 1257 (holding prosecutor's statement to the jury to send a memo to all drug traffickers was improper because it urged the jury to convict for reasons wholly irrelevant to the defendant's guilt or innocence); United States v. Sanchez, 176 F.3d 1214, 1224 25 (9th Cir.1999) (holding prosecutor's statement to the jury that it was its duty to find defendant guilty was improper because the prosecutor did not tell the jury that it had a duty to find the defendant guilty only if every element of the crime had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. ). The prosecutor's do the right thing statement was prejudicial to Cruz for several reasons. First, because the prosecutor is the sovereign's representative, the jury may have been misled into thinking his do the right thing statement was validated by the government. See United States v. Kerr, 981 F.2d 1050, 1053 (9th Cir.1992) ( A prosecutor has no business telling the jury his individual impressions of the evidence. Because he is the sovereign's representative, the jury may be misled into thinking his conclusions have been validated by the government's investigatory apparatus. ). Second, the court did not give a curative instruction. See Sanchez, 659 F.3d at 1258. Third, the prosecutor's rebuttal argument was the last thing the jury heard before beginning deliberation; this timing increased the risk that the prosecutor's improper statement influenced the jurors. Id. at 1261. We reverse Cruz's convictions and remand for a new trial. 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 1 \f U.S. v. Cruz, 592 Fed.Appx. 623 (2015) REVERSED and REMANDED. NGUYEN, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part: I agree that the prosecutor's do the right thing statement clearly constitutes prosecutorial misconduct. However, under plain error review, we may only reverse when prosecutorial misconduct has deprived a defendant of a fair trial, which we determine by look[ing] to the substance of any curative instructions and the strength of the case against the defendant absent the misconduct. United States v. Sanchez, 659 F.3d 1252, 1257 (9th Cir.2011). Here, the evidence against Cruz was overwhelming he was caught red-handed with the drugs in his car and confessed that he agreed to smuggle the drugs for money. The single instance of argument error during the government's rebuttal did not affect Cruz's substantial rights. Nevertheless, I am troubled by the government's failure to recognize the error, *625 particularly because the same office that prosecuted Cruz recently assured us that its training would reinforce the principle that all Assistant U.S. Attorneys must be aware of the rules pertaining to closing argument and must make every effort to stay well within those rules. United States v. Maloney, 755 F.3d 1044, 1046 (9th Cir.2014) (en banc). Although the trial in this case occurred before Maloney was decided, the government, post-Maloney, insisted at oral argument that its statement was proper. It was not. As the majority stated, a prosecutor steps outside of his or her proper role by encouraging the jury to do the right thing. However, there's no basis for reversal, not on this or the three other claims that Cruz also raised on appeal. I therefore would affirm.

I would otherwise have sentenced the defendant at the top of his guidelines range based on his sales of marijuana to minors, which was a factor not reflected in his advisory guidelines range. However, the Chief Judge of our district had already found the prosecution's breach of the plea agreement to be prosecutorialmisconduct, and I imposed the sentence reduction, at the defendant's request, as the appropriate sanction for such serious misconduct. I now enter this memorandum opinion and order to memorialize more fully my rationale for granting a sentence reduction as a targeted remedy for serious and recidivist prosecutorialmisconduct. I. INTRODUCTION A. Factual Background In a plea agreement, dated May 29, 2007, the parties stipulated to the following pertinent facts: A. On March 10, 2006, Tami Dicus [a co-defendant] knowingly and intentionally distributed marijuana to C.W. and S.C., minors under the age of 18 years old. B. On March 13, 2006, the Marion Police Department executed a search on the Dicus residence [in] Marion, IA. At the time of the search both Tami and David Dicus resided at the residence. Defendant's residence [in] Marion, IA, is located within 1,000 feet of Hannah Park, a playground. During this search the Marion Police Department seized the following: - $3,170 cash in drug proceeds; - Four gallon bags of marijuana; - marijuana cigarettes; *1145 - miscellaneous drug paraphernalia, including a digital scale; - ammunition; and - letters discussing their drug activity. Defendant and Tami Dicus knowingly and intentionally possessed these items. Defendant and Tami Dicus intended to distribute some or all of the marijuana. The $3,170 constituted proceeds of defendant and Tami Dicus's prior marijuana sales. * * * E. Defendant stipulates and agrees that he devised and lead [sic] the marijuana distribution conspiracy. As the leader, defendant made all the arrangements with the suppliers and purchased all the marijuana he and Tami Dicus sold during the conspiracy. F. Defendant and Tami Dicus distributed marijuana to C.W. over 30 times between 2005 and March 13, 2006. During that period, C.W. purchased a quarter of an ounce of marijuana (7 grams) on twenty or more occasions, an ounce on two occasions, and something less than a quarter of an ounce on other occasions. At the time of the distributions, C.W. was 16 years of age. Additionally, C.W. used marijuana in the Dicus residence with defendant and/or Tami Dicus on four occasions. * * * J. Defendant and Tami Dicus distributed marijuana to S.C. around 20 times. During that period, S.C. would typically purchase a dub (4 grams) of marijuana each time. At the time of the distributions, S.C. was 16 years of age. Additionally, on at least three occasions, S.C. used marijuana with defendant and Tami Dicus in the 2015 Thomson Reuters.

S.C. used marijuana with defendant on one occasion and with Tami Dicus on three occasions. * * * L. Defendant stipulates and agrees is a convicted felon, having been previously convicted of the following: that he - On about July 15, 1998 in the Iowa District Court in and for Linn County, Iowa, case number FECR 23666, defendant was sentenced for the Class D Felony offense of Possession with Intent to Deliver a Controlled Substance and the Class D felony offense of Dominion and Control of a Firearm as a Felon. - On or about September 29, 1992 in the Iowa District Court in and for Linn County, Iowa, case number CRF 13034, defendant was sentenced for the felony offense of Operating While Intoxicated, Third Offense. Plea Agreement (docket no. 27-2) (attached to minutes of May 31, 2007, plea hearing). The plea agreement also included a handwritten addition that, with the exception of an enhancement based on Dicus's role in the offense, there would be [n]o other enhancements making the adjusted offense level 25 after 3 levels downward for acceptance. Plea Agreement, 8 (emphasis added). The court finds that this stipulation was part of the consideration for the plea agreement. B. Procedural Background 1. The charges and Dicus's plea On April 18, 2007, a Grand Jury handed down an Indictment (docket no. 5) charging David Dicus with the following offenses: Count 1 charged Dicus with conspiracy to distribute and to possess with intent to distribute marijuana within 1,000 feet of a playground in violation of 21 U.S.C. 841(a)(1), 846, and 860; Count 3 *1146 charged Dicus with possession with intent to distribute marijuana within 1,000 feet of a playground after a prior conviction for a felony drug offense in violation of 21 U.S.C. 841(a)(1), 851, and 860; Count 4 charged Dicus with maintaining a place for the purpose of using marijuana within 1,000 feet of a playground in violation of 21 U.S.C. 856(a)(1) and 860; and Count 5 charged Dicus with being an unlawful user of marijuana and a felon in possession of ammunition in violation of 18 U.S.C. 922(g)(1), 922(g)(3), and 924(a)(2). 1 The Indictment included forfeiture allegations pertaining to currency, any firearms, and ammunition. On May 29, 2007, Dicus entered into the plea agreement referenced above, agreeing to plead guilty to Counts 1 and 5, and on May 31, 2007, he entered a guilty plea to those charges before a magistrate judge of this court. In the plea agreement, the parties made the following stipulations with respect to Dicus's advisory Sentencing Guidelines calculation: 8. The parties stipulate and agree that the United States Sentencing Guidelines should be applied as follows: A. For Count 1 of the Indictment: Under USSG 2D1.2(a)(3) the offense level should be calculated by starting with a base offense level of 26 because the offense occurred within 1,000 feet of a protected location and involved persons less than 18 years of age. The parties further stipulate and agree that there are no applicable specific offense characteristics. The Chapter Two offense level for Count 1 is 26. B. For Count 5 of the Indictment: Under USSG[ ] 2K2.1 the offense level should be calculated by starting with a base offense level of 14, because defendant was a prohibited person at the time he possessed the ammunition. The parties further stipulate and agree that there are no applicable specific offense characteristics. The Chapter Two offense level for Count 5 is Level 14. C. Role in the Offense The parties stipulate and agree based upon [D]efendant's leadership role in the offense, [D]efendant should receive a two-level upward adjustment. Defendant's adjusted offense level is 28. Defendant was a supervisor or leader of the conspiracy during the commission of the offenses. No other enhancements making the adjusted offense level 25 after 3 levels downward for acceptance. D. Acceptance of Responsibility 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 5 \f U.S. v. Dicus, 579 F.Supp.2d 1142 (2008) The parties stipulate and agree, that as of the date of this agreement, [D]efendant appears to qualify for a two-level downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility.... If, at the time of sentencing, the court grants a two-level reduction under U.S.S.G. 3E1.1(a), the United States agrees to make a motion under USSG 3E1.1(b) for an additional one-level reduction, acknowledging the timeliness of the [D]efendant's decision to plead guilty. 9. The [D]efendant, his attorney and the United States may make whatever comment and evidentiary offer they deem appropriate at the time of the guilty plea, sentencing or any other proceeding related to this case, so long as the offer or comment does not *1147 violate any other provision of this agreement.... Plea Agreement, at 8-9 (all emphasis in original, except handwritten words italicized and offense levels bolded). On June 18, 2007, Chief Judge Linda R. Reade, to whom this case was then assigned, accepted the magistrate judge's Report and Recommendation that the court accept Dicus's guilty plea to Counts 1 and 5. Chief Judge Reade set Dicus's sentencing for December 5, 2007. 2. The PSIR and sentencing arguments On October 29, 2007, the probation office filed a sealed presentence investigation report (PSIR) recommending, inter alia, that Dicus be sentenced as a career offender, with an adjusted base offense level of 29 and criminal history category III, based, in part, on Dicus's 1992 conviction for Operating While Intoxicated, Third Offense (1992 OWI 3rd), which was identified in the plea agreement. Plea Agreement, 23, L. On November 21, 2007, Dicus filed a Sentencing Memorandum (docket no. 45), asserting that the prosecution was bound by the plea agreement that there would be no enhancements or any finding of career offender status. Dicus also argued that his 1992 OWI 3rd offense was too old to be properly counted to establish his career offender status. Also on November 21, 2007, the prosecution filed a Sentencing Memorandum (docket no. 44) in which, notwithstanding the terms of the plea agreement, the prosecution expressly argued that Dicus should be sentenced as a career offender as defined in U.S.S.G. 4B1.1, with an adjusted offense level of 29 after a reduction for acceptance of responsibility. The only other issue addressed in the prosecution's Sentencing Memorandum was Dicus's ability to pay a fine. On November 27, 2007, the prosecution also filed a Response To Defendant's Sentencing Memorandum (docket no. 46), in which the prosecution argued that the plea agreement did not prevent the prosecution from arguing that Dicus qualifies as a career offender. 3. The prosecutorialmisconduct issue On November 29, 2007, Chief Judge Reade entered an order (docket no. 49) requiring supplemental briefs from the parties concerning whether the prosecution had breached the plea agreement and what remedy would be appropriate if the court found such a breach, expressly directing the parties' attention to United States v. Mosley, 505 F.3d 804 (8th Cir.2007), which had just been decided on October 12, 2007. Chief Judge Reade subsequently reset the sentencing hearing for December 17, 2007. filed The prosecution its Supplemental Sentencing Memorandum (docket no. 51) on December 3, 2007, and Dicus filed his Supplemental Sentencing Memorandum (docket no. 55) on December 9, 2007. By sealed order dated December 12, 2007, Chief Judge Reade found a clear violation by the prosecution of the handwritten unnumbered paragraph of the plea agreement stipulating that no other enhancement applied and that Dicus's adjusted offense level after a reduction for acceptance of responsibility would be 25. Based upon her finding of a breach of the plea agreement, Chief Judge Reade found that, pursuant to Mosley, 505 F.3d at 809-12, and Santobello v. New York, 404 U.S. 257, 262-62, 92 S.Ct. 495, 30 L.Ed.2d 427 (1971), she had no choice but to recuse herself from this case. Therefore, she cancelled the sentencing hearing scheduled for December 17, 2007, and directed that the Clerk of Court reassign the case to another district court judge. This matter was then reassigned to me. *1148 C. The Sentencing Hearing I reset Dicus's sentencing hearing for September 9, 2008. On April 16, 2008, in the interim between reassignment of the case and the sentencing hearing, the United States Supreme Court decided Begay v. United States, --- U.S. ----, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008), in which the Court held that a felony offense of driving while under the influence of alcohol is not a violent felony within the meaning of the Armed Career Criminal Act. On May 15, 2008, the Eighth Circuit 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 6 \f U.S. v. Dicus, 579 F.Supp.2d 1142 (2008) Court of Appeals held that, pursuant to Begay, felony offenses of driving while under the influence of alcohol do not qualify as violent felonies under the Armed Career Criminal Act and do not permit application of the career offender guideline, U.S.S.G. 4B1.1. United States v. Heikes, 525 F.3d 662, 664 (8th Cir.2008). At the sentencing hearing on September 9, 2008, the parties agreed, and I found, that in the wake of Begay, Dicus could no longer be sentenced as a career offender, notwithstanding the probation office's prior recommendation of such an enhancement and the prosecution's prior argument for such an enhancement. The parties also agreed, and I found, that the probation office had rescored Dicus's total offense level as 25, his criminal history category as III, and his resulting advisory Sentencing Guidelines range as 70 to 87 months. Dicus then reiterated his argument that his 1992 OWI 3rd offense was too old to be properly considered for determination of his criminal history category, adding that the State of Iowa wipes the slate clean after 12 years for such an offense, so that his criminal history category should be I. The prosecution argued that the State of Iowa only wipes the slate clean for administrative purposes of driver's licensing, but that the offense remains a prior felony conviction. Dicus's attorney conceded that he was making the argument about the effect of the 1992 OWI 3rd offense at his client's request. I found that the 1992 OWI 3rd offense was within the pertinent fifteen-year period for consideration of Dicus's criminal history, because Dicus had received a five-year prison term and was paroled on October 15, 1994. Thus, I found that, notwithstanding Dicus's objections, Dicus's criminal history category remained III. to argue that he wished Dicus next asserted the reasonableness of the sentence in light of the misconduct on the part of the prosecution in breaching the plea agreement. Dicus argued that the prosecution had gotten the benefit of the Supreme Court's decision in Begay, in that the decision in Begay appeared to remedy the prosecution's misconduct in seeking a career offender enhancement based on the 1992 OWI 3rd offense, notwithstanding contrary provisions in the plea agreement, so that the prosecution should still have some accountability for blatantly disregarding the plea agreement. Therefore, he sought a sentence at the low end of his advisory Sentencing Guidelines range as the appropriate sanction for the prosecution's misconduct. The prosecution, now represented by a different Assistant United States Attorney, argued that, even if the violation of the plea agreement was clear or blatant, it was not in bad faith, and was more in the nature of a technical violation, because the career offender provision was not what one would ordinarily consider an enhancement. The prosecution also suggested that the career offender argument had been more in the way of informing the court of the circumstances pertinent to the defendant's sentence. Contrary to the prosecution's frivolous and grossly inaccurate assertions, the record plainly establishes that the parties had *1149 known about the 1992 OWI 3rd offense and its possible effect on Dicus's status as a career offender from at least as early as the date of the plea agreement, and, indeed, the probation office had already brought the offense and its impact on Dicus's possible career offender status to the court's attention in the October 29, 2007, PSIR, before the prosecution filed its Sentencing Memorandum expressly arguing for a career offender enhancement. Thus, there was no need for the prosecution to bring the career offender issue to the court's attention. The record also plainly established that the prosecution's agreement not to seek career offender status based on the 1992 OWI 3rd offense was part of the consideration for the plea agreement, where a career offender enhancement would almost double, or even more than double, Dicus's potential sentence. Finally, the record plainly establishes that the prosecution did more than simply advise the court of the possibility of a career offender issue; the prosecution affirmatively argued for application of a career offender enhancement, notwithstanding the no other enhancements provision of the plea agreement. Consequently, I found as follows: I think it's beyond blatant. I think it's egregious. To enter into an agreement that you're going to do something and do a 180-degree turn and then actually argue for the enhancement in complete violation of the plea agreement? Why isn't that blatant and egregious? It's one thing if you're trying to bring information to the judge because you have a duty as an officer of the Court. But that's not the situation we have here. It was already brought to the attention of the judge by probation, and then the government turned around and argued it in direction violation of the plea agreement. * * * 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 7 \f U.S. v. Dicus, 579 F.Supp.2d 1142 (2008) ... I'm just going with what Judge Reade found, it was a clear violation and the language of the agreement was plain and simple and clear and the government breached the plea agreement. So I'm not making any additional findings. I'm not-I like your analogy to punitive damages, you know. I'm not finding any bad faith, although it seems inconceivable to me that you could breach the plea agreement in the way the government did it and argue that it was in good faith. Real Time Transcript, September 8, 2008, Sentencing Hearing at 16, 19; see also id. at 27 (reiterating that the breach was egregious, and adding that it was willful, although not necessarily malicious ). Upon further reflection, and further opportunity to study the transcript of the sentencing hearing, I now conclude that the prosecution clearly acted in bad faith when it breached the plea agreement. Nevertheless, whether I characterize the prosecution's breach of the plea agreement as in bad faith or not in good faith makes no difference in my decision concerning the appropriate remedy in this case. In light of the prosecution's egregious misconduct, and the relief from that misconduct already provided-however serendipitously-by the Supreme Court's decision in Begay, Dicus argued for some positive benefit in the form of a sentence at the low end of the advisory guidelines range. The prosecution chose to offer no arguments concerning the appropriate sentence. I found that Dicus's total offense level is 25 and that his criminal history category is III, which results in an advisory United States Sentencing Guidelines range of 70 to 87 months. I pointed out that Dicus's drug sales to minors would ordinarily have led me to sentence him at the top of the advisory guidelines range, or indeed, to *1150 impose an upward variance, because I did not find that such conduct was taken into consideration in the guidelines calculation, and that the statutory enhancement for such conduct was of no consequence, because Dicus's guidelines range was higher than the statutory enhancement. I found, however, that my belief that the prosecution's breach of the plea agreement was egregious and that there ought to be some consequence to the United States Attorney's Office for that breach weighed against my inclination to sentence Dicus at the top of the guidelines range. Therefore, I determined that Dicus should be sentenced at the bottom of the guidelines range, resulting in what is essentially a seventeen-month reduction in his sentence for the prosecution's breach of the plea agreement, albeit a reduction still within the context of Dicus's advisory guidelines range. I also found that the low end of the guidelines range was sufficient to meet all of the factors in 18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(2), and that none of the other 3553(a) factors weighed in favor of an upward or downward variance. Therefore, I concluded that a reasonable sentence was 70 months and that such a sentence was sufficient, but no greater than necessary, to achieve all of the sentencing purposes. I turn now to a fuller explanation of my legal rationale for granting a sentence reduction as a remedy for prosecutorialmisconduct. I have issued this ruling with speed, but not with haste, within the time for the prosecution to appeal the sentencing determination, if it should desire to do so in light of the amplified rationale that I now provide. However, I note that at no time during the sentencing hearing did the prosecution object to my sentence at the low end of the guidelines range based upon the serious and recidivist prosecutorialmisconduct. II. LEGAL ANALYSIS A. The Prosecution's Breach Of A Plea Agreement 1. Due process implications The breach of a plea agreement by the prosecution is a serious matter: Allowing the government to breach a promise that induced a guilty plea violates due process. Santobello v. New York, 404 U.S. 257, 92 S.Ct. 495, 30 L.Ed.2d 427 (1971); [United States v.] Van Thournout, 100 F.3d [590,] 594 [ (8th Cir.1996) ]. Further, with respect to federal prosecutions, the courts' concerns run even wider than protection of the defendant's individual constitutional rights-to concerns for the honor of the government, public confidence in the fair administration of justice, and the effective administration of justice in a federal scheme of government. United States v. Jensen, 423 F.3d 851, 854 (8th Cir.2005) (internal citation omitted). 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 8 \f U.S. v. Dicus, 579 F.Supp.2d 1142 (2008) United States v. E.V., 500 F.3d 747, 751 (8th Cir.2007); accord United States v. Sanchez, 508 F.3d 456, 460 (8th Cir.2007) ( Due process may be violated if there is a breach of a promise that induced a guilty plea. ). Indeed, breach of a plea agreement is sufficiently serious that harmless-error analysis does not apply when the government breaches a plea agreement. United States v. Mosley, 505 F.3d 804, 810 (8th Cir.2007); see also id. at 812 (reading Santobello to hold that harmless-error analysis does not apply to breach of a plea agreement). 2. Recidivist prosecutorialmisconduct in the Northern District of Iowa Because of the seriousness of the prosecution's breach of a plea agreement, it is unfortunate that such incidents are not unheard of, either in this Circuit or this District. Indeed, just before the breach of *1151 the plea agreement occurred in this case, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals held on October 12, 2007, in United States v. Mosley, 505 F.3d 804 (8th Cir.2007), that the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Iowa had also breached a plea agreement in another case before Chief Judge Reade by making improper sentencing arguments. Specifically, in Mosley, the prosecution had argued that the defendant had failed to accept responsibility because of actions taken before she signed the plea agreement, after stipulating that, as of the date of the plea agreement, the defendant appeared to qualify for a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility. See505 F.3d at 808-09. Under these circumstances, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Iowa should have been particularly cautious about compliance with the terms of plea agreements at the time of the breach in question here, which once again involved arguing for sentence determinations that were contrary to stipulations in a plea agreement. Consequently, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Iowa now comes before me as a repeat offender, in light of the violations of plea agreements, in similar ways and, indeed, within a relatively short time span, in Mosley and this case. 2 3. The applicable two-step analysis [1] When a defendant asserts that the prosecution has breached a plea agreement, the court engages in a two-step process: The court must first determine whether or not there has been a breach of the plea agreement, and if there was a breach, then determine the proper remedy. See, e.g., E.V., 500 F.3d at 751 & 754;accord Mosley, 505 F.3d at 809-12 (where there has been a breach of the plea agreement, harmless- error analysis does not apply, and the court must consider the proper remedy). Here, Chief Judge Reade has already performed the first step in the process, by finding a clear violation of the plea agreement by the prosecution. The process here is bifurcated, because Chief Judge Reade found that, under Santobello v. New York, 404 U.S. 257, 262-63, 92 S.Ct. 495, 30 L.Ed.2d 427 (1971), as construed in Mosley, 505 F.3d at 809-12, once she found a breach of the plea agreement, Dicus had to be sentenced by a different judge to determine the appropriate remedy for the breach. Mosley, 505 F.3d at 812 (emphasizing that reassignment to a different judge is in no sense to question the fairness of the sentencing judge ) (quoting Santobello, 404 U.S. at 263, 92 S.Ct. 495). Thus, the second step in the process is left for me. Nevertheless, because I find that the nature of the breach is relevant to the proper remedy, I will examine both steps in the process. B. The Two-Step Analysis Here 1. Step 1: Determination of breach [2] As to the first step in the analysis of an alleged breach of a plea agreement by the prosecution, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals has explained, Whether the government has breached a plea agreement is a matter of law reviewed de novo. Id. at 751 (citing United States v. Van Thournout, 100 F.3d 590, 594 (8th Cir.1996)). More specifically, [p]lea agreements are contractual in nature and should be interpreted according to general contractual principles. Id.; accord Sanchez, 508 F.3d at 460;Mosley, 505 F.3d at 808 ( Where a plea agreement has been accepted *1152 by the court, we generally interpret the meaning of the terms of the agreement according to basic principles of contract law. ). [W]hen a plea rests in any significant degree on a promise or agreement of the prosecutor, so that it can be said to be part of the inducement or consideration, such promise must be fulfilled. Id. at 752 (quoting Santobello, 404 U.S. at 262, 92 S.Ct. 495). Thus, the court looks to see if there is an enforceable, bargained-for term of the plea agreement that has been violated. Id. 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 9 \f U.S. v. Dicus, 579 F.Supp.2d 1142 (2008) [3] Here, the handwritten addition to the plea agreement, stating that, apart from an enhancement for role in the offense, there would be [n]o other enhancements, and that the adjusted offense level would, therefore, be 25 after 3 levels downward for acceptance, see Plea Agreement (docket no. 27-2), 8(D), was plainly a bargained-for term of the plea agreement, E.V., 500 F.3d at 752, as evidenced by its handwritten addition to the otherwise typewritten plea agreement. Moreover, where the existence of Dicus's prior conviction for the 1992 OWI 3rd was plainly known to the parties at the time of the plea agreement, because it was mentioned in that plea agreement, Plea Agreement, 23, L, the agreement to the adjusted offense level and no further enhancements was plainly an inducement to enter into the agreement. E.V., 500 F.3d at 752. Moreover, I concur fully in Chief Judge Reade's finding that the term of the plea agreement in question was plain and unambiguous, and that the prosecution's argument for a career offender enhancement was, consequently, a clear violation of that provision. Indeed, as explained above, I find that the violation was not just clear, but egregious, not least because it went to the heart of Dicus's inducement to plead guilty to avoid the career offender implications of the 1992 OWI 3rd offense under pre-Begay law. Thus, I find that there was not only a breach of the plea agreement by the prosecution, but an egregious breach. 2. Step 2: Determination of the appropriate remedy Because Chief Judge Reade found, and I agree, that there was a breach of the plea agreement, the question that is entirely for me to decide is the proper remedy for the prosecution's breach of the plea agreement. See, e.g., E.V., 500 F.3d at 751 & 754;accord Mosley, 505 F.3d at 809-12 (where there has been a breach of the plea agreement, harmless-error analysis does not apply, and the court must consider the proper remedy). I begin that determination by examining the typical remedies for the prosecution's breach of a plea agreement. a. The typical remedies When the government breaches a plea agreement, the defendant is typically given the option of withdrawing his guilty plea or demanding specific performance. E.V., 500 F.3d at 754 (quoting United States v. Goings, 200 F.3d 539, 544 (8th Cir.2000), with internal citations omitted). Indeed, most courts, including the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, have usually treated withdrawal of the defendant's guilty plea or specific performance of the breached provision of the agreement as the only available options. See, e.g., Goings, 200 F.3d at 544 ( Where it is clear that the government violated the terms of a plea bargain, the defendant is typically given the option of withdrawing his guilty plea or demanding specific performance. ); United States v. Mitchell, 136 F.3d 1192, 1194 (8th Cir.1998) (noting that the remedies for breach of plea agreement are specific performance or permission to withdraw plea), cert. denied,534 U.S. 856, 122 S.Ct. 129, 151 L.Ed.2d 83 (2001); *1153 United States v. Van Thournout, 100 F.3d 590, 594 (8th Cir.1996) ( There are two potential remedies for the government's breach of a plea agreement: remand for specific performance and withdrawal of the guilty plea. ) (quoting Margalli-Olvera, cited infra); Margalli-Olvera v. I.N.S., 43 F.3d 345, 354-55 (8th Cir.1994) ( There are two potential remedies for the government's breach of a plea agreement: remand for specific performance and withdrawal of the guilty plea. ); accord United States v. Cudjoe, 534 F.3d 1349, 1356-57 & n. 4 (10th Cir.2008); United States v. Griffin, 510 F.3d 354, 367 (2d Cir.2007); United States v. Rivera, 357 F.3d 290, 297 (3d Cir.2004) ( When the government breaches a plea agreement, the general rule is to remand the case to the district court for a determination whether to grant specific performance or to allow withdrawal of the plea. ) (quoting United States v. Nolan-Cooper, 155 F.3d 221, 241 (3d Cir.1998)); United States v. Skidmore, 998 F.2d 372, 375 (6th Cir.1993) (if the prosecution breaches a plea agreement, the breach may be remedied by requiring specific performance or permitting the defendant to withdraw the plea); United States v. Jefferies, 908 F.2d 1520, 1527 (11th Cir.1990) (in the event of a breach of a plea agreement by the prosecution, there are two available remedies: [t]he court can order specific performance of the agreement or afford the defendant the opportunity to withdraw the plea. ). These are, after all, the two remedies expressly discussed by the Supreme Court in Santobello, 404 U.S. at 262-63, 92 S.Ct. 495. Of the two, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals has suggested that specific performance is the preferred remedy. Goings, 200 F.3d at 544;Van Thournout, 100 F.3d at 594;Margalli-Olvera, 43 F.3d at 354-55;accord Cudjoe, 534 F.3d at 1357 n. 4 (finding that resentencing pursuant to the terms of the plea agreement is the preferred remedy and suggesting that withdrawal of the guilty plea should only be allowed when the breach is 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 10 \f U.S. v. Dicus, 579 F.Supp.2d 1142 (2008) particularly egregious or intentional ) (quoting United States v. Brye, 146 F.3d 1207, 1213 (10th Cir.1998)). a different judge as the remedy that would fully cure the prosecution's breach. Id. In contrast to the assumption that the court must grant one of these two typical remedies if the prosecution breaches a plea agreement, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals has recognized that [t]here is a very limited exception to the need for a remedy for a plea agreement breach by the government where the violation is so minor that it does not cause the defendant to suffer any meaningful detriment. United States v. Vaval, 404 F.3d 144, 155 (2d Cir.2005). As that court explained, In assessing whether a defendant suffered a meaningful detriment, the critical question is what the defendant reasonably understood to be the terms of the plea agreement, and whether his or her reasonable expectations have been fulfilled. See Paradiso v. United States, 689 F.2d 28, 31 (2d Cir.1982). For example, in United States v. Casamento, 887 F.2d 1141, 1181 (2d Cir.1989), we held that the government violated a plea agreement by submitting a sentencing memorandum without specifically reserving its right to do so. We deemed a remedy to be unnecessary, however, because the memorandum included only brief statements that could properly have been presented to the district court as rebuttal to [defendant's] arguments. Id. at 1182. Thus, the essential purpose of the agreement was fulfilled. Similarly, in Paradiso, 689 F.2d at 30-31, we held that no remedy was required for a technical violation by the court of a binding plea agreement because the sentence imposed did comport with the reasonable understanding and expectations of the defendant as to the sentence for which he had bargained. Id. at 31. Vaval, 404 F.3d at 155-56. In Vaval, however, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals *1154 found that the prosecution's breach, which consisted of breach of a promise not to move for an upward departure or to argue where to sentence the defendant within his guidelines range, required a remedy, because the breached promise was unquestionably the centerpiece of the agreement. Id. at 156. The court found that, because the prosecution had violated essential provisions of the plea agreement, and because no specific performance of the agreement was (or could be) granted to [the defendant] through a Rule 35 proceeding, the court was required to order some remedy, and the court granted resentencing before The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals has also held that no relief from the prosecution's violation of the plea agreement was appropriate where the sentencing court had refused to impose the enhancement for which the prosecution had improperly argued, in derogation of its promises in a plea agreement. See E.V., 500 F.3d at 755. In E.V., the prosecution's breach was introduction of firearms testimony, despite terms of a plea agreement that none of the offense characteristics contained in U.S.S.G. 2D1.1(b), which includes possession of a dangerous weapon, including a firearm, were applicable. Id. at 752. The reason that no remedy was necessary in that case was that [t]he [district] court adhered to its assurance that there's not going to be a gun enhancement, and did not increase Appellant's base offense level pursuant to section 2D1.1 or enhance his sentence pursuant to section 5K2.6 based on his alleged possession of a weapon. Id. at 755. Thus, there may be circumstances in which, notwithstanding a breach of a plea agreement by the prosecution, the defendant may not be entitled to any relief. b. Dicus's entitlement to relief [4] I find that this is not a case in which no remedy is appropriate, because the prosecution's breach was not minor or technical. See Vaval, 404 F.3d at 155-56. Rather, much as in Vaval, the prosecution's argument for a career offender enhancement was contrary to the no other enhancements provision that was unquestionably the centerpiece of the agreement. Id. at 156. Because the plea agreement was clear, Dicus reasonably expected that the prosecution would not seek a career offender enhancement, and that reasonable expectation was not fulfilled. Id. Thus, Dicus suffered a meaningful detriment when, notwithstanding the no other enhancements provision, the prosecution expressly argued for a career offender enhancement, and some remedy is required. Id.; accord Mosley, 505 F.3d at 809-12 (where there has been a breach of the plea agreement, harmless- error analysis does not apply, and the court must consider the proper remedy). 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 11 \f U.S. v. Dicus, 579 F.Supp.2d 1142 (2008) I also find that this is not a case in which no remedy is appropriate, because the sentencing court declined to impose the sentencing enhancement for which the prosecution improperly argued, which, in this case, was the then- applicable career offender enhancement, based on Dicus's 1992 OWI 3rd. See E.V., 500 F.3d at 755 (no relief from the prosecution's violation of the plea agreement was appropriate, because the sentencing court had refused to impose the enhancement for which the prosecution had improperly argued, in derogation of its promises in a plea agreement). Here, the sentencing court did not save Dicus from the consequences of the prosecution's improper actions, an intervening change in the law did. I agree with Dicus that the prosecution should not get the benefit of Begay to save it from the consequences of its violation of the plea *1155 agreement, because granting no relief is inappropriate where the defendant has been subjected to a due process violation for which harmless-error analysis is not available. See Santobello, 404 U.S. at 257, 92 S.Ct. 495 (allowing the government to breach a promise that induced a guilty plea violates due process to which harmless-error analysis does not apply); Sanchez, 508 F.3d at 460 ( Due process may be violated if there is a breach of a promise that induced a guilty plea. ); Mosley, 505 F.3d at 810-812 (breach of a plea agreement is a due process violation to which harmless-error analysis does not apply); E.V., 500 F.3d at 751 (violation of a plea agreement violates due process). Granting no relief is also inappropriate, because it would do nothing to deter prosecutorialmisconduct or to give defendants an incentive to raise prosecutorialmisconduct claims. See, e.g., Sonja Starr, 3 Sentence Reduction as a Remedy for ProsecutorialMisconduct (hereinafter Starr, Sentence Reduction ), 2 & n. 10 (unpublished draft, September 2, 2008; used by permission) (citing Guido Calabresi, The Exclusionary Rule, 26 HARV. J.L. & PUB. POL'YY 111, 116-17 (2003), and Harry M. Caldwell and Carol A. Chase, The Unruly Exclusionary Rule, 78 MARQ. L.REV.. 45, 68-71 (1994), as suggesting that the appropriate remedy for prosecutorialmisconduct should be the combination of direct sanctions against the police, such as fines, to deter misconduct, with sentence reductions, to give defendants an incentive to raise misconduct claims). Moreover, [p]rosecutorialmisconduct has been a widespread and widely criticized problem in the U.S. criminal justice system for decades, albeit one for which existing remedies are ineffective, largely because they are rarely invoked. Id. at 4 & 1. For example, as the Second Circuit Court of Appeals observed more than two decades ago, Given this Court's unwillingness to use reversals as a means of disciplining prosecutors, threats to do so seem unlikely to have much effect. As a practical matter, prosecutors know that courts are reluctant to overturn convictions because of improper [conduct]. United States v. Modica, 663 F.2d 1173, 1183 (2d Cir.1981) (cited in Starr, Sentence Reduction, at 13). The problem cannot continue to go unremedied by the courts, so that some relief from prosecutorialmisconduct is appropriate in this case. c. Inadequacy of the typical remedies here Courts have recognized that there may be circumstances in which one or the other of the preferred remedies for the prosecution's breach of a plea agreement-specific performance of the breached provision or withdrawal of the defendant's guilty plea-is inadequate. For example, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals has recognized that, where the defendant has already served a considerable portion of his sentence, so that permitting the withdrawal of his plea would be an empty remedy, or where the defendant sought specific performance because he did not want to withdraw his guilty plea, the court should not impose a remedy against the non-breaching party's will or a remedy that would be no remedy at all. See United States v. Williams, 510 F.3d 416, 427 (3d Cir.2007) (citing United States v. Badaracco, 954 F.2d 928, 941 (3d Cir.1992), as the first example, and Nolan-Cooper, 155 F.3d at 241, as the second). Thus, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals recognized that an exception to a typical remedy was appropriate, when the circumstances dictate that there is only one appropriate remedy for the [non-breaching] defendant, although the exception was simply to default to the other typical remedy. Id.; see also *1156 United States v. VanDam, 493 F.3d 1194, 1206 (10th Cir.2007) ( Although the choice of remedy rests with the court rather than the defendant, the court would grant the defendant's request for resentencing, rather than requiring him to withdraw of his guilty plea, because [w]hen ... the defendant does not seek to withdraw his guilty plea, the less dramatic remedy of resentencing appears to be most apt. ). 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 12 \f U.S. v. Dicus, 579 F.Supp.2d 1142 (2008) [5] Here, however, the circumstances are exceptional in that neither of the typical remedies would provide adequate relief. Requiring specific performance of the breached term of the plea agreement would grant Dicus no relief whatsoever, because, in the interim between the prosecution's breach of the plea agreement and Dicus's sentencing hearing, the Supreme Court had mooted the issue of whether Dicus could be subjected to the career offender enhancement he was trying to avoid by entering into the plea agreement. See Begay, --- U.S. ----, 128 S.Ct. 1581 (holding that a felony offense of driving while under the influence of alcohol is not a violent felony within the meaning of the Armed Career Criminal Act); Heikes, 525 F.3d at 664 (recognizing that the decision in Begay means that a felony offense of driving while under the influence of alcohol cannot be the basis for a career offender sentencing enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. 4B1.1). Similarly, granting Dicus the opportunity to withdraw his guilty plea would likely result in prejudice to Dicus, rather than any relief from the prosecution's misconduct, as he would have to commence the whole process anew, admittedly without any possibility of a career offender enhancement, but equally without any assurance that the prosecution will not contest his adjusted offense level of 25. Under these circumstances, it is inappropriate to foist upon the defendant a remedy of allowing him to withdraw his guilty plea, because he does not seek such a remedy, even if specific performance of the breached term of the plea agreement would provide him with no relief. Cf. Williams, 510 F.3d at 427 (holding that the court should not impose a remedy against the non-breaching party's will, so that the defendant, who did not want to withdraw his guilty plea, should be resentenced pursuant to the terms of the breached plea agreement). Thus, in this case, the recognized remedies for the prosecution's breach of the plea agreement provide no relief at all. The question is, what remedies are available in such circumstances? d. The touchstones for the appropriate remedy Although the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, like other courts, has explicitly recognized only the typical remedies of specific performance or withdrawal of a guilty plea for the prosecution's breach of a plea agreement, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals has recognized that the determination of the appropriate remedy is typically left to the discretion of the court, and that enforcement of the agreement and withdrawal of the guilty plea are [a]mong the options available to the court. United States v. Fowler, 445 F.3d 1035, 1038 (8th Cir.2006) (emphasis added); see also E.V., 500 F.3d at 754 ( When the government breaches a plea agreement, the defendant is typically given the option of withdrawing his guilty plea or demanding specific performance. ) (emphasis added) (quoting Goings, 200 F.3d at 544). 4 This language appears to me to recognize that, in appropriate circumstances, *1157 the court can consider sanctions for the prosecution's breach of a plea agreement beyond the recognized remedies of ordering specific performance of the breached provision or allowing the defendant to withdraw his guilty plea. Similarly, as I read the Supreme Court's decision in Santobello, that case does not stand for the proposition that specific performance or withdrawal of a guilty plea are necessarily the only remedies available for the prosecution's violation of a plea agreement, even though those were the only two remedies expressly discussed in that case. See Santobello, 404 U.S. at 262-63, 92 S.Ct. 495. In remanding the case to the state court to determine, in its discretion, which remedy was appropriate, the Supreme Court explained that its concern was to best serve the interests of justice and appropriate recognition of the duties of the prosecution in relation to promises made in the negotiation of pleas of guilty. Id. I believe that the interests of justice and appropriate recognition of the duties of the prosecution in relation to promises made in the negotiation of pleas of guilty, therefore, should be the touchstones in determining the appropriate remedy for the prosecution's breach of a plea agreement. I also believe that a wider range of remedies should be considered, in appropriate cases, because breach of a plea agreement is a due process violation that is sufficiently serious that harmless-error analysis does not apply. Mosley, 505 F.3d at 810;see also id. at 812(Santobello holds that harmless-error analysis does not apply). If the typical remedies provide no relief, then failing to award any other relief suggests, in effect, that there has been no harm from the breach to be remedied, and the absence of other relief denigrates the due process right that has been violated. Santobello, 404 U.S. at 257, 92 S.Ct. 495 (allowing the government to breach a promise that induced a guilty plea violates due process); Sanchez, 508 F.3d at 460 ( Due process 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 13 \f U.S. v. Dicus, 579 F.Supp.2d 1142 (2008) may be violated if there is a breach of a promise that induced a guilty plea. ); E.V., 500 F.3d at 751 (violation of a plea agreement violates due process). e. The appropriate remedy here Here, using what I find from Santobello to be the touchstones for determination of the appropriate relief for the prosecution's breach of a plea agreement, I cannot find that the interests of justice or appropriate recognition of the duties of the prosecution in relation to promises made in the negotiation of pleas of guilty, Santobello, 404 U.S. at 262-63, 92 S.Ct. 495, will be served by according Dicus no relief on the ground that he has obtained what he sought in the plea agreement's no other enhancements provision. It is true that Dicus obtained what he sought in the plea agreement-avoidance of a career offender enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. 4B1.1 because of his 1992 OWI 3rd conviction-but because of an intervening change in the law wrought by Begay, --- U.S. ----, 128 S.Ct. 1581. The situation might be different, if Dicus had already been sentenced, and the sentencing court had declined to impose the then-applicable career offender enhancement, based on Dicus's 1992 OWI 3rd, notwithstanding the prosecution's improper argument for such an enhancement in derogation of its promises in the plea agreement. See E.V., 500 F.3d at 755 (no relief from the prosecution's violation of the plea agreement was appropriate, because the sentencing court had refused to impose the enhancement for which the prosecution had improperly argued, in derogation of its promises in a plea agreement). Here, however, I agree with Dicus that the prosecution should not get the benefit of Begay to save it from the consequences of its violation of the plea agreement, because granting no relief in these circumstances simply will not recognize *1158 the duties of the prosecution in relation to promises made in the negotiation of pleas of guilty. The situation also might be different, if the prosecution's violation of the plea agreement had been less egregious, but it was egregious, and thus, undermined the whole system of trust upon which plea negotiations must be based. Again, granting no relief in these circumstances will not recognize the duties of the prosecution in relation to promises made in the negotiation of pleas of guilty, nor will it serve the interests of justice, which are best served by granting relief from egregious misconduct. Moreover, as I mentioned above, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Iowa is a repeat offender, where just before the breach of the plea agreement occurred in this case, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals had held that, in another case before Chief Judge Reade, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Iowa had also breached a plea agreement by seeking sentencing determinations contrary to stipulations in the plea agreement. See Mosley, 505 F.3d at 808-09 (handed down October 12, 2007, just over a month before the prosecution filed its sentencing memorandum in this case on November 21, 2007, in which the prosecution sought application of the career offender sentencing provision contrary to the stipulations in the plea agreement). Both the interests of justice and recognition of the duties of the prosecution in relation to promises made in the negotiation of pleas of guilty require a response to the repeated misconduct of the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Iowa. Under the circumstances of this case, I believe that an appropriate remedy for the prosecution's misconduct-that is, a remedy that serves both the interests of justice and shows appropriate recognition of the duties of the prosecution in relation to promises made in the negotiation of pleas of guilty, Santobello, 404 U.S. at 262-63, 92 S.Ct. 495-is to reduce Dicus's sentence to the low end of his advisory sentencing guidelines range. This is so, notwithstanding that, in the absence of such prosecutorialmisconduct, I would very likely have sentenced Dicus at the top end of the range based on his repeated sales of marijuana to minors. I find that such a remedy is appropriate, because it is likely to have a deterrent effect on prosecutorialmisconduct, to provide an incentive to defendants to raise misconduct claims, and to serve other salutary goals. 5 *1159 First, precisely because this remedy provides a tangible consequence for the prosecution's misconduct, which the usual remedies for breach of a plea agreement do not in this case, this remedy serves the interests of justice by reinforcing that there must be consequences for violation of a defendant's due process rights, and the remedy also relates directly to the prosecution's duties in relation to promises made in the negotiation of pleas of guilty, because it recognizes that the prosecution's breached promise was an inducement to the defendant's guilty plea. Santobello, 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 14 \f U.S. v. Dicus, 579 F.Supp.2d 1142 (2008) 404 U.S. at 262-63, 92 S.Ct. 495 (identifying the interests that the proper remedy should serve). Most scholars have assumed that prosecutors generally prefer higher sentences, and the existing empirical evidence supports that conclusion. Starr, Sentence Reduction, at 23 (citing Stephen F. Smith, Proportionality and Federalization, 91 VA. L.REV. 879, (2005) 879, 896, 928 (2005); Jeffrey Standen, Plea Bargaining in the Shadow of the Guidelines, 81 CAL. L.REV. 1471, 1480 (1993); and Albert Altschuler, Prosecutor's Role in Plea Bargaining, 36 U. CHI. L.REV.. 50, 52 (1968)). Indeed, my own experience over fourteen years and the sentencing of over 2,600 defendants does nothing to suggest that the assumption that prosecutors in this District prefer higher sentences is wrong. Thus, a sentence reduction is likely to be an effective deterrent to prosecutorialmisconduct. There is also a symmetry to such a remedy, which grants a defendant a sentence reduction for the prosecution's post- plea misconduct, where the United States Sentencing *1160 Guidelines are replete with provisions that impose a sentence increase upon a defendant for his post-plea misconduct. Indeed, the United States Attorney's Office in this District frequently attempts to increase a defendant's sentence for alleged post-plea misconduct. In answer to the suggestion that such a sanction visits upon the client, the United States, the sins of the attorney, whereas the Sentencing Guidelines visit upon the client the consequences of his own misconduct, I would respond that I am sanctioning egregious conduct by an Assistant United States Attorney in his official capacity and, in that respect, I am sanctioning conduct that is conduct by the executive branch of the United States. No other sanction would be a deterrent to official misconduct, because a fine against the prosecutor personally would inflict a private sanction for official misconduct, and a fine against the United States would be no deterrent at all, no matter how large. Second, such a remedy provides an important incentive to defendants to raise issues of prosecutorialmisconduct. Cf. Starr, Sentence Reduction, at 2 & n. 10 (citing commentators who have suggested that the appropriate remedy is a combination of sanctions, including sentence reductions, to deter misconduct and to give defendants an incentive to raise misconduct claims). This is so, because, just as a sentence reduction provides a tangible consequence for the prosecution's misconduct, it provides a tangible benefit to the wronged defendant. Such a remedy also serves the interests of justice by vindicating the defendant's due process rights in a way that relates directly to the prosecution's duties in relation to promises made in the negotiation of pleas of guilty, where such a remedy recognizes that the prosecution's breached promise was an inducement to the defendant's guilty plea. Santobello, 404 U.S. at 262-63, 92 S.Ct. 495 (identifying the interests that the proper remedy should serve). Even in cases in which a defendant may have some incentive to assert prosecutorialmisconduct, it is rare that the defendant's counsel does not have some disincentives for asserting such a claim arising from the possibility of friction in future relations with the prosecutor's office in question, which could result in a detriment to other clients. This case was unique in that Dicus's sentencing hearing was defense counsel's last appearance in a federal criminal case before retiring, after thirty-two years of very impressive service to the legal profession, so that defense counsel was in the unique and unusual position of having nothing to fear for future clients from arguing for some relief for Dicus from prosecutorialmisconduct in his case. Thus, the availability of a remedy that is less disruptive than withdrawal of a guilty plea may help to overcome the disincentives that defense counsel may otherwise face to raising a claim of prosecutorialmisconduct, at the same time that the availability of such a remedy may increase the incentives for defendants to raise such claims and may increase the incentives for courts to sanction such misconduct, for the reasons explained just below. Third, such a remedy not only avoids the inadequacies of the typical remedies, it avoids a remedy that would appear to be excessive or a windfall to the defendant, such as dismissal of the indictment, thereby removing one explanation for the failure of courts to respond to prosecutorialmisconduct. As Professor Starr has observed, them as for Current remedies prosecutorialmisconduct are strikingly ineffective, largely because courts view too costly to grant. Scholars too often have been unrealistic about this remedial deterrence proposing stronger remedies for misconduct when the more realistic solution might be nominally weaker ones. Adding sentence reduction *1161 to current all-or-nothing remedial schemes could help to deter and problem, 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 15 \f U.S. v. Dicus, 579 F.Supp.2d 1142 (2008) condemn prosecutorialmisconduct, while avoiding the social costs of retrial and providing a fair measure of relief to defendants whose rights have been violated. Starr, Sentence Reduction at 55. Thus, a sentence reduction may be more palatable for the court to impose than other, more typical remedies for prosecutorialmisconduct. Moreover, in this case, a sentence reduction is more appropriate, in my view, than foisting withdrawal of his plea on Dicus, which he does not want and which could work to his detriment, or doing nothing, because specific performance is no longer an option. Cf. Williams, 510 F.3d at 427 (holding that the court should not impose a remedy against the non- breaching party's will, so that the defendant, who did not want to withdraw his guilty plea, should be resentenced pursuant to the terms of the breached plea agreement). Finally, the interests of justice from a public perspective are also served by imposing a sentence reduction as a sanction for the prosecution's violation of a plea agreement, where, as here, notwithstanding the reduction for prosecutorialmisconduct, the sentence imposed still falls within the advisory guidelines range and is, therefore, presumptively reasonable on appeal. See Rita v. United States, 551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2465, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007); Gall v. United States, 552 U.S. 38, ----, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); United States v. Whiting, 522 F.3d 845, 849 (8th Cir.2008). 6 The interests of justice from both the defendant's and the public's perspective are also served, where, for the reasons explained below, the reduced sentence imposed as a sanction still serves the purposes of sentencing without regard to remedying prosecutorialmisconduct. Therefore, as a sanction for the prosecution's violation of the plea agreement in this case, I sentence Dicus to 70 months imprisonment, the low end of his advisory guidelines range. C. Reasonableness Of The Resulting Sentence [6] Because I have reduced Dicus's sentence as a sanction for prosecutorialmisconduct, I must determine whether the resulting sentence in this case, as in any other case not involving such a sanction, still serves the purposes of sentencing, without regard to remedying prosecutorialmisconduct. As explained above, there are no remaining objections to the calculation of Dicus's advisory guidelines range. Thus, the focus is the reasonableness of the sentence that I have ultimately imposed, after calculation of Dicus's advisory guidelines range. 1. The reasonableness analysis As the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals very recently reiterated, review the imposed sentence *1162 We for reasonableness, first ensur[ing] that the district court committed no significant procedural error. Gall v. United States, 552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); see also Whiting, 522 F.3d at 849. If the district court's decision is procedurally sound, we proceed to review the sentence for substantive reasonableness under an abuse of discretion standard. Gall, 128 S.Ct. at 597;Whiting, 522 F.3d at 849. We may apply a presumption of reasonableness to a sentence within the properly calculated guideline range but are not required to do so. See Rita v. United States, 551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2465, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007); Gall, 128 S.Ct. at 597;Whiting, 522 F.3d at 849. In imposing a sentence under 18 U.S.C. 3553(a), a sentencing court abuses its discretion if it fails to consider a relevant factor that should have received significant weight, gives significant weight to an improper or irrelevant factor, or considers only the appropriate factors but commits a clear error of judgment in weighing those factors. United States v. Watson, 480 F.3d 1175, 1177 (8th Cir.2007). United States v. Brown, 539 F.3d 835, 841-42 (8th Cir.2008). As the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals has also explained, Substantive sentencing acts include, most importantly, how a district court balances the 3553(a) sentencing factors to derive its sentence. United States v. Saddler, 538 F.3d 879, 889 (8th Cir.2008) (quoting United States v. Tabor, 531 F.3d 688, 691 (8th Cir.2008)). 2. The balance of the 3553(a) factors Section 3553(a) of Title 18 provides that [t]he court shall impose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes set forth in paragraph (2) of 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 16 \f U.S. v. Dicus, 579 F.Supp.2d 1142 (2008) this subsection, giving consideration to various enumerated factors. 18 U.S.C. 3553(a). After considering the balance of the pertinent 3553(a) factors, see Saddler, 538 F.3d at 889 (such balance is the most important substantive sentencing act), I find that a 70-month sentence is appropriate. In particular, such a sentence is appropriate in light of the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant, 18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(1), including prior convictions, which fully justify a sentence within the advisory guidelines range; the need for the sentence imposed, 18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(2), which here arises in large part from the extent and frequency of the defendant's illegal conduct; the kinds of sentences available, 18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(3); the kinds of sentence and the sentencing range established for Dicus's offenses, 18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(4) (A); pertinent policy statements, 18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(5); and the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct, including in this case Dicus's wife, who received a 48-month sentence in this case, 18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(6). in that the alternative, I believe Indeed, albeit the prosecution's breach of a plea agreement may properly be considered as a 3553(a) factor in determining the defendant's sentence. This is so, because 3553(a)(1) requires the court to consider, inter alia, the defendant's history. 18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(1). The defendant's post-plea history presumably includes not only his own conduct, but the conduct of the prosecution toward him. In other words, wrongs done to the defendant post-plea seem to me to be just as relevant to determination of the defendant's sentence as any wrongs done by the defendant post-plea. For that reason, I believe that I could properly consider the prosecution's *1163 breach of the defendant's plea agreement as part of his history pursuant to 3553(a)(1) in determining the appropriate sentence. More specifically, as to the purposes set forth in subsection (2), I find that a sentence of 70 months is sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to reflect the seriousness of and to provide just punishment for Dicus's offenses of conspiracy to distribute and to possess with intent to distribute marijuana within 1,000 feet of a playground in violation of 21 U.S.C. 841(a)(1), 846, and 860 in Count 1, and being an unlawful user of marijuana and a felon in possession of ammunition in violation of 18 U.S.C. 922(g)(1), 922(g)(3), and 924(a)(2), in Count 5, and also sufficient to promote respect for the law, because the term of imprisonment is far from insignificant in comparison to the crimes to which Dicus has pleaded guilty. See18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(2)(A). I also find that such a sentence will afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct, again, because it is far from insignificant in comparison to the crimes to which Dicus has pleaded guilty. See18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(2) (B). Next, I find that such a sentence will protect the public from further crimes of the defendant, not only because of the length of his incarceration, but because of the opportunity that the term of imprisonment will provide for him to obtain drug treatment and to work toward rehabilitation. See18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(2)(C). Finally, I find such a sentence will provide Dicus with needed educational or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment, including the 500-hour residential drug treatment program, in the most effective manner. See18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(2)(D). Thus, I reiterate my conclusion that a sentence of 70 months imprisonment is reasonable in this case. III. CONCLUSION In this case, I find that a reduction in the defendant's sentence, albeit one to the low end of his advisory guidelines range, when I would otherwise have sentenced him to the high end, is the appropriate remedy for the prosecution's serious violation of the defendant's plea agreement. Such a remedy provides both deterrence for the prosecution's misconduct and an incentive to defendants to raise such misconduct. Such a remedy also serves the interests of justice and shows appropriate recognition of the duties of the prosecution in relation to promises made in the negotiation of pleas of guilty. Santobello, 404 U.S. at 262-63, 92 S.Ct. 495. Finally, the reduced sentence in this case still serves the purposes of sentencing, upon consideration of the pertinent 3553(a) factors, in that it is sufficient, but no greater than necessary, to achieve all of the appropriate sentencing purposes. THEREFORE, I reiterate my conclusion at the September 9, 2008, sentencing hearing that defendant David Dicus should be sentenced to 70 months imprisonment, the low end of his advisory guidelines sentencing range, as a sanction for the prosecution's serious and recidivist violation of the defendant's plea agreement. 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 17 \f U.S. v. Dicus, 579 F.Supp.2d 1142 (2008) IT IS SO ORDERED. Footnotes 1 2 3 4 5 Tami Dicus, Dicus's wife, was charged as a co-defendant on Counts 1, 3, and 4, and as the sole defendant on Count 2, which charged her with distribution of marijuana to a person under the age of twenty-one within 1,000 feet of a playground in violation of 21 U.S.C. 841(a)(1), 859, and 860. Nor are these the only two incidents of serious prosecutorialmisconduct in this District during my tenure as a United States District Court Judge. Although there are other examples of serious prosecutorialmisconduct in this District, it is not necessary to catalogue them for purposes of the present ruling. Sonja Starr is an Assistant Professor at the University of Maryland School of Law. Admittedly, in E.V., the court departed from these typical remedies by not granting any relief, because it was clear beyond doubt that the government's breach did not impact Appellant's sentence. E.V., 500 F.3d at 755 (quoting Goings, 200 F.3d at 544). Even so, E.V. suggests that atypical remedies may be available. I note Professor Starr's observation that [s]entence reduction is an accepted remedy in a number of jurisdictions for a variety of kinds of violations of criminal defendants' rights, having been approved, for example, by the European Court of Human Rights, some European domestic courts, several Canadian provincial supreme courts, and the Appeals Chamber of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, although it is essentially unknown in U.S. courts. Starr, Sentence Reduction, at 1. I also note, however, that reference to foreign law has been a controversial issue of late. See, e.g., David S. Law, Globalization and the Future of Constitutional Rights, 102 NW. U.L.REV. 1277, 1279-80 (2008) (noting that there has been a torrential outpouring of literature on the propriety of judicial citation to foreign law, prompted by the Supreme Court's use of foreign authority in a recent string of controversial cases, and citing numerous examples); Mark Tushnet, When is Knowing Less Better Than Knowing More?: Unpacking the Controversy Over Supreme Court Reference to Non-U.S. Law, 90 Minn. L.Rev. 1275, 1276 (2006) (noting this controversy). The fiery debate over the issue has engaged even United States Supreme Court Justices. Compare Confirmation Hearing on the Nomination of Samuel Alito to the United States Supreme Court, 2006 WL 53273 ( I don't think that we should look to foreign law to interpret our own Constitution. I agree with you that the laws of the United States consist of the Constitution and treaties and laws and, I would add, regulations that are promulgated in accordance with law. And I don't think that it's appropriate or useful to look to foreign law in interpreting the provisions of our Constitution. I think the framers would be stunned by the idea that the Bill of Rights is to be interpreted by taking a poll of the countries of the world. ); Confirmation Hearing on the Nomination of John G. Roberts, Jr., to be Chief Justice of the United States Before the S. Comm. on the Judiciary, 109th Cong. 200, 200-01 (2005) (Statement of then Judge Roberts) ( In foreign law you can find anything you want. If you don't find it in the decisions of France or Italy, it's in the decisions of Somalia or Japan or Indonesia or wherever. As somebody said in another context, looking at foreign law for support is like looking out over a crowd and picking out your friends. You can find them, they're there. And that actually expands the discretion of the judge. It allows the judge to incorporate his or her own personal preferences, cloak them with the authority of precedent because they're finding precedent in foreign law, and use that to determine the meaning of the Constitution. I think that's a misuse of precedent, not a correct use of precedent. ); with Roper v. Simmons, 543 U.S. 551, 578, 125 S.Ct. 1183, 161 L.Ed.2d 1 (2005) (Kennedy, J., writing for the majority) ( The opinion of the world community, while not controlling our outcome, does provide respected and significant confirmation for our own conclusions. ); Ruth Bader Ginsburg, A decent Respect to the Opinions of [Human]kind : The Value of a Comparative Perspective in Constitutional Adjudication, Constitutional Court of South Africa (Feb. 7, 2006) (reprinted at http://supremecourtus. gov/publicinfo/speeches/sp_02-07b-06.html) ( Foreign opinions are not authoritative; they set no binding precedent for the U.S. judge. But they can add to the store of knowledge relevant to the solution of trying questions. Yes, we should approach foreign legal materials with sensitivity to our differences, deficiencies, and imperfect understanding, but imperfection, I believe, should not lead us to abandon the effort to learn what we can from the experience and good thinking foreign sources may convey. ). I also note that, as a controversy rages in the United States concerning citation of foreign law, United States decisions have recently been cited less often by foreign courts. See, e.g., United States Court Is Now Guiding Fewer Nations, N.Y. TIMES (Sept. 17, 2008) (online edition at http:// www.nytimes.com/2008/09/18/us/18legal.html? r=2&hp&oref=slogin&oref=slogin). I add that I am not relying on foreign 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 18 \f U.S. v. Dicus, 579 F.Supp.2d 1142 (2008) 6 law sources suggesting reduction of a defendant's sentence as a sanction for prosecutorialmisconduct to support this opinion. I take no position, in this case, on whether still more egregious or malicious prosecutorialmisconduct, or circumstances in which the defendant's conduct did not otherwise justify sentencing him at the top of the advisory guidelines range, might justify reduction of a sentence below the low end of the advisory guidelines range as a sanction for serious prosecutorialmisconduct. However, I do not mean to suggest that the low end of the advisory guidelines range is the lower limit for a sentence reduction as a sanction for serious prosecutorialmisconduct. For example, even a high-end or mid-range guidelines sentence could be reduced below the low end for serious prosecutorialmisconduct, so long as the ultimate sentence was sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to achieve all of the purposes of federal sentencing. Also, even in this case, had I not chosen the high end of the advisory guidelines range to start with, the rationale of this opinion would suggest that a sentence reduction for serious prosecutorialmisconduct could have resulted in a sentence below the bottom of the advisory guidelines range.

Synopsis Background: Defendant pleaded guilty to conspiracy to distribute and to possess with intent to distribute marijuana within 1,000 feet of a playground and being an unlawful user of marijuana and a felon in possession of ammunition. Following recusal of the original District Court judge assigned to the case after a finding that the government breached the plea agreement, the defendant appeared for sentencing.

I would otherwise have sentenced the defendant at the top of his guidelines range based on his sales of marijuana to minors, which was a factor not reflected in his advisory guidelines range. However, the Chief Judge of our district had already found the prosecution's breach of the plea agreement to be prosecutorialmisconduct, and I imposed the sentence reduction, at the defendant's request, as the appropriate sanction for such serious misconduct. I now enter this memorandum opinion and order to memorialize more fully my rationale for granting a sentence reduction as a targeted remedy for serious and recidivist prosecutorialmisconduct. I. INTRODUCTION A. Factual Background In a plea agreement, dated May 29, 2007, the parties stipulated to the following pertinent facts: A. On March 10, 2006, Tami Dicus [a co-defendant] knowingly and intentionally distributed marijuana to C.W. and S.C., minors under the age of 18 years old. B. On March 13, 2006, the Marion Police Department executed a search on the Dicus residence [in] Marion, IA. At the time of the search both Tami and David Dicus resided at the residence. Defendant's residence [in] Marion, IA, is located within 1,000 feet of Hannah Park, a playground. During this search the Marion Police Department seized the following: - $3,170 cash in drug proceeds; - Four gallon bags of marijuana; - marijuana cigarettes; *1145 - miscellaneous drug paraphernalia, including a digital scale; - ammunition; and - letters discussing their drug activity. Defendant and Tami Dicus knowingly and intentionally possessed these items. Defendant and Tami Dicus intended to distribute some or all of the marijuana. The $3,170 constituted proceeds of defendant and Tami Dicus's prior marijuana sales. * * * E. Defendant stipulates and agrees that he devised and lead [sic] the marijuana distribution conspiracy. As the leader, defendant made all the arrangements with the suppliers and purchased all the marijuana he and Tami Dicus sold during the conspiracy. F. Defendant and Tami Dicus distributed marijuana to C.W. over 30 times between 2005 and March 13, 2006. During that period, C.W. purchased a quarter of an ounce of marijuana (7 grams) on twenty or more occasions, an ounce on two occasions, and something less than a quarter of an ounce on other occasions. At the time of the distributions, C.W. was 16 years of age. Additionally, C.W. used marijuana in the Dicus residence with defendant and/or Tami Dicus on four occasions. * * * J. Defendant and Tami Dicus distributed marijuana to S.C. around 20 times. During that period, S.C. would typically purchase a dub (4 grams) of marijuana each time. At the time of the distributions, S.C. was 16 years of age. Additionally, on at least three occasions, S.C. used marijuana with defendant and Tami Dicus in the 2015 Thomson Reuters.

S.C. used marijuana with defendant on one occasion and with Tami Dicus on three occasions. * * * L. Defendant stipulates and agrees is a convicted felon, having been previously convicted of the following: that he - On about July 15, 1998 in the Iowa District Court in and for Linn County, Iowa, case number FECR 23666, defendant was sentenced for the Class D Felony offense of Possession with Intent to Deliver a Controlled Substance and the Class D felony offense of Dominion and Control of a Firearm as a Felon. - On or about September 29, 1992 in the Iowa District Court in and for Linn County, Iowa, case number CRF 13034, defendant was sentenced for the felony offense of Operating While Intoxicated, Third Offense. Plea Agreement (docket no. 27-2) (attached to minutes of May 31, 2007, plea hearing). The plea agreement also included a handwritten addition that, with the exception of an enhancement based on Dicus's role in the offense, there would be [n]o other enhancements making the adjusted offense level 25 after 3 levels downward for acceptance. Plea Agreement, 8 (emphasis added). The court finds that this stipulation was part of the consideration for the plea agreement. B. Procedural Background 1. The charges and Dicus's plea On April 18, 2007, a Grand Jury handed down an Indictment (docket no. 5) charging David Dicus with the following offenses: Count 1 charged Dicus with conspiracy to distribute and to possess with intent to distribute marijuana within 1,000 feet of a playground in violation of 21 U.S.C. 841(a)(1), 846, and 860; Count 3 *1146 charged Dicus with possession with intent to distribute marijuana within 1,000 feet of a playground after a prior conviction for a felony drug offense in violation of 21 U.S.C. 841(a)(1), 851, and 860; Count 4 charged Dicus with maintaining a place for the purpose of using marijuana within 1,000 feet of a playground in violation of 21 U.S.C. 856(a)(1) and 860; and Count 5 charged Dicus with being an unlawful user of marijuana and a felon in possession of ammunition in violation of 18 U.S.C. 922(g)(1), 922(g)(3), and 924(a)(2). 1 The Indictment included forfeiture allegations pertaining to currency, any firearms, and ammunition. On May 29, 2007, Dicus entered into the plea agreement referenced above, agreeing to plead guilty to Counts 1 and 5, and on May 31, 2007, he entered a guilty plea to those charges before a magistrate judge of this court. In the plea agreement, the parties made the following stipulations with respect to Dicus's advisory Sentencing Guidelines calculation: 8. The parties stipulate and agree that the United States Sentencing Guidelines should be applied as follows: A. For Count 1 of the Indictment: Under USSG 2D1.2(a)(3) the offense level should be calculated by starting with a base offense level of 26 because the offense occurred within 1,000 feet of a protected location and involved persons less than 18 years of age. The parties further stipulate and agree that there are no applicable specific offense characteristics. The Chapter Two offense level for Count 1 is 26. B. For Count 5 of the Indictment: Under USSG[ ] 2K2.1 the offense level should be calculated by starting with a base offense level of 14, because defendant was a prohibited person at the time he possessed the ammunition. The parties further stipulate and agree that there are no applicable specific offense characteristics. The Chapter Two offense level for Count 5 is Level 14. C. Role in the Offense The parties stipulate and agree based upon [D]efendant's leadership role in the offense, [D]efendant should receive a two-level upward adjustment. Defendant's adjusted offense level is 28. Defendant was a supervisor or leader of the conspiracy during the commission of the offenses. No other enhancements making the adjusted offense level 25 after 3 levels downward for acceptance. D. Acceptance of Responsibility 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 5 \f U.S. v. Dicus, 579 F.Supp.2d 1142 (2008) The parties stipulate and agree, that as of the date of this agreement, [D]efendant appears to qualify for a two-level downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility.... If, at the time of sentencing, the court grants a two-level reduction under U.S.S.G. 3E1.1(a), the United States agrees to make a motion under USSG 3E1.1(b) for an additional one-level reduction, acknowledging the timeliness of the [D]efendant's decision to plead guilty. 9. The [D]efendant, his attorney and the United States may make whatever comment and evidentiary offer they deem appropriate at the time of the guilty plea, sentencing or any other proceeding related to this case, so long as the offer or comment does not *1147 violate any other provision of this agreement.... Plea Agreement, at 8-9 (all emphasis in original, except handwritten words italicized and offense levels bolded). On June 18, 2007, Chief Judge Linda R. Reade, to whom this case was then assigned, accepted the magistrate judge's Report and Recommendation that the court accept Dicus's guilty plea to Counts 1 and 5. Chief Judge Reade set Dicus's sentencing for December 5, 2007. 2. The PSIR and sentencing arguments On October 29, 2007, the probation office filed a sealed presentence investigation report (PSIR) recommending, inter alia, that Dicus be sentenced as a career offender, with an adjusted base offense level of 29 and criminal history category III, based, in part, on Dicus's 1992 conviction for Operating While Intoxicated, Third Offense (1992 OWI 3rd), which was identified in the plea agreement. Plea Agreement, 23, L. On November 21, 2007, Dicus filed a Sentencing Memorandum (docket no. 45), asserting that the prosecution was bound by the plea agreement that there would be no enhancements or any finding of career offender status. Dicus also argued that his 1992 OWI 3rd offense was too old to be properly counted to establish his career offender status. Also on November 21, 2007, the prosecution filed a Sentencing Memorandum (docket no. 44) in which, notwithstanding the terms of the plea agreement, the prosecution expressly argued that Dicus should be sentenced as a career offender as defined in U.S.S.G. 4B1.1, with an adjusted offense level of 29 after a reduction for acceptance of responsibility. The only other issue addressed in the prosecution's Sentencing Memorandum was Dicus's ability to pay a fine. On November 27, 2007, the prosecution also filed a Response To Defendant's Sentencing Memorandum (docket no. 46), in which the prosecution argued that the plea agreement did not prevent the prosecution from arguing that Dicus qualifies as a career offender. 3. The prosecutorialmisconduct issue On November 29, 2007, Chief Judge Reade entered an order (docket no. 49) requiring supplemental briefs from the parties concerning whether the prosecution had breached the plea agreement and what remedy would be appropriate if the court found such a breach, expressly directing the parties' attention to United States v. Mosley, 505 F.3d 804 (8th Cir.2007), which had just been decided on October 12, 2007. Chief Judge Reade subsequently reset the sentencing hearing for December 17, 2007. filed The prosecution its Supplemental Sentencing Memorandum (docket no. 51) on December 3, 2007, and Dicus filed his Supplemental Sentencing Memorandum (docket no. 55) on December 9, 2007. By sealed order dated December 12, 2007, Chief Judge Reade found a clear violation by the prosecution of the handwritten unnumbered paragraph of the plea agreement stipulating that no other enhancement applied and that Dicus's adjusted offense level after a reduction for acceptance of responsibility would be 25. Based upon her finding of a breach of the plea agreement, Chief Judge Reade found that, pursuant to Mosley, 505 F.3d at 809-12, and Santobello v. New York, 404 U.S. 257, 262-62, 92 S.Ct. 495, 30 L.Ed.2d 427 (1971), she had no choice but to recuse herself from this case. Therefore, she cancelled the sentencing hearing scheduled for December 17, 2007, and directed that the Clerk of Court reassign the case to another district court judge. This matter was then reassigned to me. *1148 C. The Sentencing Hearing I reset Dicus's sentencing hearing for September 9, 2008. On April 16, 2008, in the interim between reassignment of the case and the sentencing hearing, the United States Supreme Court decided Begay v. United States, --- U.S. ----, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008), in which the Court held that a felony offense of driving while under the influence of alcohol is not a violent felony within the meaning of the Armed Career Criminal Act. On May 15, 2008, the Eighth Circuit 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 6 \f U.S. v. Dicus, 579 F.Supp.2d 1142 (2008) Court of Appeals held that, pursuant to Begay, felony offenses of driving while under the influence of alcohol do not qualify as violent felonies under the Armed Career Criminal Act and do not permit application of the career offender guideline, U.S.S.G. 4B1.1. United States v. Heikes, 525 F.3d 662, 664 (8th Cir.2008). At the sentencing hearing on September 9, 2008, the parties agreed, and I found, that in the wake of Begay, Dicus could no longer be sentenced as a career offender, notwithstanding the probation office's prior recommendation of such an enhancement and the prosecution's prior argument for such an enhancement. The parties also agreed, and I found, that the probation office had rescored Dicus's total offense level as 25, his criminal history category as III, and his resulting advisory Sentencing Guidelines range as 70 to 87 months. Dicus then reiterated his argument that his 1992 OWI 3rd offense was too old to be properly considered for determination of his criminal history category, adding that the State of Iowa wipes the slate clean after 12 years for such an offense, so that his criminal history category should be I. The prosecution argued that the State of Iowa only wipes the slate clean for administrative purposes of driver's licensing, but that the offense remains a prior felony conviction. Dicus's attorney conceded that he was making the argument about the effect of the 1992 OWI 3rd offense at his client's request. I found that the 1992 OWI 3rd offense was within the pertinent fifteen-year period for consideration of Dicus's criminal history, because Dicus had received a five-year prison term and was paroled on October 15, 1994. Thus, I found that, notwithstanding Dicus's objections, Dicus's criminal history category remained III. to argue that he wished Dicus next asserted the reasonableness of the sentence in light of the misconduct on the part of the prosecution in breaching the plea agreement. Dicus argued that the prosecution had gotten the benefit of the Supreme Court's decision in Begay, in that the decision in Begay appeared to remedy the prosecution's misconduct in seeking a career offender enhancement based on the 1992 OWI 3rd offense, notwithstanding contrary provisions in the plea agreement, so that the prosecution should still have some accountability for blatantly disregarding the plea agreement. Therefore, he sought a sentence at the low end of his advisory Sentencing Guidelines range as the appropriate sanction for the prosecution's misconduct. The prosecution, now represented by a different Assistant United States Attorney, argued that, even if the violation of the plea agreement was clear or blatant, it was not in bad faith, and was more in the nature of a technical violation, because the career offender provision was not what one would ordinarily consider an enhancement. The prosecution also suggested that the career offender argument had been more in the way of informing the court of the circumstances pertinent to the defendant's sentence. Contrary to the prosecution's frivolous and grossly inaccurate assertions, the record plainly establishes that the parties had *1149 known about the 1992 OWI 3rd offense and its possible effect on Dicus's status as a career offender from at least as early as the date of the plea agreement, and, indeed, the probation office had already brought the offense and its impact on Dicus's possible career offender status to the court's attention in the October 29, 2007, PSIR, before the prosecution filed its Sentencing Memorandum expressly arguing for a career offender enhancement. Thus, there was no need for the prosecution to bring the career offender issue to the court's attention. The record also plainly established that the prosecution's agreement not to seek career offender status based on the 1992 OWI 3rd offense was part of the consideration for the plea agreement, where a career offender enhancement would almost double, or even more than double, Dicus's potential sentence. Finally, the record plainly establishes that the prosecution did more than simply advise the court of the possibility of a career offender issue; the prosecution affirmatively argued for application of a career offender enhancement, notwithstanding the no other enhancements provision of the plea agreement. Consequently, I found as follows: I think it's beyond blatant. I think it's egregious. To enter into an agreement that you're going to do something and do a 180-degree turn and then actually argue for the enhancement in complete violation of the plea agreement? Why isn't that blatant and egregious? It's one thing if you're trying to bring information to the judge because you have a duty as an officer of the Court. But that's not the situation we have here. It was already brought to the attention of the judge by probation, and then the government turned around and argued it in direction violation of the plea agreement. * * * 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 7 \f U.S. v. Dicus, 579 F.Supp.2d 1142 (2008) ... I'm just going with what Judge Reade found, it was a clear violation and the language of the agreement was plain and simple and clear and the government breached the plea agreement. So I'm not making any additional findings. I'm not-I like your analogy to punitive damages, you know. I'm not finding any bad faith, although it seems inconceivable to me that you could breach the plea agreement in the way the government did it and argue that it was in good faith. Real Time Transcript, September 8, 2008, Sentencing Hearing at 16, 19; see also id. at 27 (reiterating that the breach was egregious, and adding that it was willful, although not necessarily malicious ). Upon further reflection, and further opportunity to study the transcript of the sentencing hearing, I now conclude that the prosecution clearly acted in bad faith when it breached the plea agreement. Nevertheless, whether I characterize the prosecution's breach of the plea agreement as in bad faith or not in good faith makes no difference in my decision concerning the appropriate remedy in this case. In light of the prosecution's egregious misconduct, and the relief from that misconduct already provided-however serendipitously-by the Supreme Court's decision in Begay, Dicus argued for some positive benefit in the form of a sentence at the low end of the advisory guidelines range. The prosecution chose to offer no arguments concerning the appropriate sentence. I found that Dicus's total offense level is 25 and that his criminal history category is III, which results in an advisory United States Sentencing Guidelines range of 70 to 87 months. I pointed out that Dicus's drug sales to minors would ordinarily have led me to sentence him at the top of the advisory guidelines range, or indeed, to *1150 impose an upward variance, because I did not find that such conduct was taken into consideration in the guidelines calculation, and that the statutory enhancement for such conduct was of no consequence, because Dicus's guidelines range was higher than the statutory enhancement. I found, however, that my belief that the prosecution's breach of the plea agreement was egregious and that there ought to be some consequence to the United States Attorney's Office for that breach weighed against my inclination to sentence Dicus at the top of the guidelines range. Therefore, I determined that Dicus should be sentenced at the bottom of the guidelines range, resulting in what is essentially a seventeen-month reduction in his sentence for the prosecution's breach of the plea agreement, albeit a reduction still within the context of Dicus's advisory guidelines range. I also found that the low end of the guidelines range was sufficient to meet all of the factors in 18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(2), and that none of the other 3553(a) factors weighed in favor of an upward or downward variance. Therefore, I concluded that a reasonable sentence was 70 months and that such a sentence was sufficient, but no greater than necessary, to achieve all of the sentencing purposes. I turn now to a fuller explanation of my legal rationale for granting a sentence reduction as a remedy for prosecutorialmisconduct. I have issued this ruling with speed, but not with haste, within the time for the prosecution to appeal the sentencing determination, if it should desire to do so in light of the amplified rationale that I now provide. However, I note that at no time during the sentencing hearing did the prosecution object to my sentence at the low end of the guidelines range based upon the serious and recidivist prosecutorialmisconduct. II. LEGAL ANALYSIS A. The Prosecution's Breach Of A Plea Agreement 1. Due process implications The breach of a plea agreement by the prosecution is a serious matter: Allowing the government to breach a promise that induced a guilty plea violates due process. Santobello v. New York, 404 U.S. 257, 92 S.Ct. 495, 30 L.Ed.2d 427 (1971); [United States v.] Van Thournout, 100 F.3d [590,] 594 [ (8th Cir.1996) ]. Further, with respect to federal prosecutions, the courts' concerns run even wider than protection of the defendant's individual constitutional rights-to concerns for the honor of the government, public confidence in the fair administration of justice, and the effective administration of justice in a federal scheme of government. United States v. Jensen, 423 F.3d 851, 854 (8th Cir.2005) (internal citation omitted). 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 8 \f U.S. v. Dicus, 579 F.Supp.2d 1142 (2008) United States v. E.V., 500 F.3d 747, 751 (8th Cir.2007); accord United States v. Sanchez, 508 F.3d 456, 460 (8th Cir.2007) ( Due process may be violated if there is a breach of a promise that induced a guilty plea. ). Indeed, breach of a plea agreement is sufficiently serious that harmless-error analysis does not apply when the government breaches a plea agreement. United States v. Mosley, 505 F.3d 804, 810 (8th Cir.2007); see also id. at 812 (reading Santobello to hold that harmless-error analysis does not apply to breach of a plea agreement). 2. Recidivist prosecutorialmisconduct in the Northern District of Iowa Because of the seriousness of the prosecution's breach of a plea agreement, it is unfortunate that such incidents are not unheard of, either in this Circuit or this District. Indeed, just before the breach of *1151 the plea agreement occurred in this case, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals held on October 12, 2007, in United States v. Mosley, 505 F.3d 804 (8th Cir.2007), that the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Iowa had also breached a plea agreement in another case before Chief Judge Reade by making improper sentencing arguments. Specifically, in Mosley, the prosecution had argued that the defendant had failed to accept responsibility because of actions taken before she signed the plea agreement, after stipulating that, as of the date of the plea agreement, the defendant appeared to qualify for a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility. See505 F.3d at 808-09. Under these circumstances, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Iowa should have been particularly cautious about compliance with the terms of plea agreements at the time of the breach in question here, which once again involved arguing for sentence determinations that were contrary to stipulations in a plea agreement. Consequently, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Iowa now comes before me as a repeat offender, in light of the violations of plea agreements, in similar ways and, indeed, within a relatively short time span, in Mosley and this case. 2 3. The applicable two-step analysis [1] When a defendant asserts that the prosecution has breached a plea agreement, the court engages in a two-step process: The court must first determine whether or not there has been a breach of the plea agreement, and if there was a breach, then determine the proper remedy. See, e.g., E.V., 500 F.3d at 751 & 754;accord Mosley, 505 F.3d at 809-12 (where there has been a breach of the plea agreement, harmless- error analysis does not apply, and the court must consider the proper remedy). Here, Chief Judge Reade has already performed the first step in the process, by finding a clear violation of the plea agreement by the prosecution. The process here is bifurcated, because Chief Judge Reade found that, under Santobello v. New York, 404 U.S. 257, 262-63, 92 S.Ct. 495, 30 L.Ed.2d 427 (1971), as construed in Mosley, 505 F.3d at 809-12, once she found a breach of the plea agreement, Dicus had to be sentenced by a different judge to determine the appropriate remedy for the breach. Mosley, 505 F.3d at 812 (emphasizing that reassignment to a different judge is in no sense to question the fairness of the sentencing judge ) (quoting Santobello, 404 U.S. at 263, 92 S.Ct. 495). Thus, the second step in the process is left for me. Nevertheless, because I find that the nature of the breach is relevant to the proper remedy, I will examine both steps in the process. B. The Two-Step Analysis Here 1. Step 1: Determination of breach [2] As to the first step in the analysis of an alleged breach of a plea agreement by the prosecution, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals has explained, Whether the government has breached a plea agreement is a matter of law reviewed de novo. Id. at 751 (citing United States v. Van Thournout, 100 F.3d 590, 594 (8th Cir.1996)). More specifically, [p]lea agreements are contractual in nature and should be interpreted according to general contractual principles. Id.; accord Sanchez, 508 F.3d at 460;Mosley, 505 F.3d at 808 ( Where a plea agreement has been accepted *1152 by the court, we generally interpret the meaning of the terms of the agreement according to basic principles of contract law. ). [W]hen a plea rests in any significant degree on a promise or agreement of the prosecutor, so that it can be said to be part of the inducement or consideration, such promise must be fulfilled. Id. at 752 (quoting Santobello, 404 U.S. at 262, 92 S.Ct. 495). Thus, the court looks to see if there is an enforceable, bargained-for term of the plea agreement that has been violated. Id. 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 9 \f U.S. v. Dicus, 579 F.Supp.2d 1142 (2008) [3] Here, the handwritten addition to the plea agreement, stating that, apart from an enhancement for role in the offense, there would be [n]o other enhancements, and that the adjusted offense level would, therefore, be 25 after 3 levels downward for acceptance, see Plea Agreement (docket no. 27-2), 8(D), was plainly a bargained-for term of the plea agreement, E.V., 500 F.3d at 752, as evidenced by its handwritten addition to the otherwise typewritten plea agreement. Moreover, where the existence of Dicus's prior conviction for the 1992 OWI 3rd was plainly known to the parties at the time of the plea agreement, because it was mentioned in that plea agreement, Plea Agreement, 23, L, the agreement to the adjusted offense level and no further enhancements was plainly an inducement to enter into the agreement. E.V., 500 F.3d at 752. Moreover, I concur fully in Chief Judge Reade's finding that the term of the plea agreement in question was plain and unambiguous, and that the prosecution's argument for a career offender enhancement was, consequently, a clear violation of that provision. Indeed, as explained above, I find that the violation was not just clear, but egregious, not least because it went to the heart of Dicus's inducement to plead guilty to avoid the career offender implications of the 1992 OWI 3rd offense under pre-Begay law. Thus, I find that there was not only a breach of the plea agreement by the prosecution, but an egregious breach. 2. Step 2: Determination of the appropriate remedy Because Chief Judge Reade found, and I agree, that there was a breach of the plea agreement, the question that is entirely for me to decide is the proper remedy for the prosecution's breach of the plea agreement. See, e.g., E.V., 500 F.3d at 751 & 754;accord Mosley, 505 F.3d at 809-12 (where there has been a breach of the plea agreement, harmless-error analysis does not apply, and the court must consider the proper remedy). I begin that determination by examining the typical remedies for the prosecution's breach of a plea agreement. a. The typical remedies When the government breaches a plea agreement, the defendant is typically given the option of withdrawing his guilty plea or demanding specific performance. E.V., 500 F.3d at 754 (quoting United States v. Goings, 200 F.3d 539, 544 (8th Cir.2000), with internal citations omitted). Indeed, most courts, including the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, have usually treated withdrawal of the defendant's guilty plea or specific performance of the breached provision of the agreement as the only available options. See, e.g., Goings, 200 F.3d at 544 ( Where it is clear that the government violated the terms of a plea bargain, the defendant is typically given the option of withdrawing his guilty plea or demanding specific performance. ); United States v. Mitchell, 136 F.3d 1192, 1194 (8th Cir.1998) (noting that the remedies for breach of plea agreement are specific performance or permission to withdraw plea), cert. denied,534 U.S. 856, 122 S.Ct. 129, 151 L.Ed.2d 83 (2001); *1153 United States v. Van Thournout, 100 F.3d 590, 594 (8th Cir.1996) ( There are two potential remedies for the government's breach of a plea agreement: remand for specific performance and withdrawal of the guilty plea. ) (quoting Margalli-Olvera, cited infra); Margalli-Olvera v. I.N.S., 43 F.3d 345, 354-55 (8th Cir.1994) ( There are two potential remedies for the government's breach of a plea agreement: remand for specific performance and withdrawal of the guilty plea. ); accord United States v. Cudjoe, 534 F.3d 1349, 1356-57 & n. 4 (10th Cir.2008); United States v. Griffin, 510 F.3d 354, 367 (2d Cir.2007); United States v. Rivera, 357 F.3d 290, 297 (3d Cir.2004) ( When the government breaches a plea agreement, the general rule is to remand the case to the district court for a determination whether to grant specific performance or to allow withdrawal of the plea. ) (quoting United States v. Nolan-Cooper, 155 F.3d 221, 241 (3d Cir.1998)); United States v. Skidmore, 998 F.2d 372, 375 (6th Cir.1993) (if the prosecution breaches a plea agreement, the breach may be remedied by requiring specific performance or permitting the defendant to withdraw the plea); United States v. Jefferies, 908 F.2d 1520, 1527 (11th Cir.1990) (in the event of a breach of a plea agreement by the prosecution, there are two available remedies: [t]he court can order specific performance of the agreement or afford the defendant the opportunity to withdraw the plea. ). These are, after all, the two remedies expressly discussed by the Supreme Court in Santobello, 404 U.S. at 262-63, 92 S.Ct. 495. Of the two, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals has suggested that specific performance is the preferred remedy. Goings, 200 F.3d at 544;Van Thournout, 100 F.3d at 594;Margalli-Olvera, 43 F.3d at 354-55;accord Cudjoe, 534 F.3d at 1357 n. 4 (finding that resentencing pursuant to the terms of the plea agreement is the preferred remedy and suggesting that withdrawal of the guilty plea should only be allowed when the breach is 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 10 \f U.S. v. Dicus, 579 F.Supp.2d 1142 (2008) particularly egregious or intentional ) (quoting United States v. Brye, 146 F.3d 1207, 1213 (10th Cir.1998)). a different judge as the remedy that would fully cure the prosecution's breach. Id. In contrast to the assumption that the court must grant one of these two typical remedies if the prosecution breaches a plea agreement, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals has recognized that [t]here is a very limited exception to the need for a remedy for a plea agreement breach by the government where the violation is so minor that it does not cause the defendant to suffer any meaningful detriment. United States v. Vaval, 404 F.3d 144, 155 (2d Cir.2005). As that court explained, In assessing whether a defendant suffered a meaningful detriment, the critical question is what the defendant reasonably understood to be the terms of the plea agreement, and whether his or her reasonable expectations have been fulfilled. See Paradiso v. United States, 689 F.2d 28, 31 (2d Cir.1982). For example, in United States v. Casamento, 887 F.2d 1141, 1181 (2d Cir.1989), we held that the government violated a plea agreement by submitting a sentencing memorandum without specifically reserving its right to do so. We deemed a remedy to be unnecessary, however, because the memorandum included only brief statements that could properly have been presented to the district court as rebuttal to [defendant's] arguments. Id. at 1182. Thus, the essential purpose of the agreement was fulfilled. Similarly, in Paradiso, 689 F.2d at 30-31, we held that no remedy was required for a technical violation by the court of a binding plea agreement because the sentence imposed did comport with the reasonable understanding and expectations of the defendant as to the sentence for which he had bargained. Id. at 31. Vaval, 404 F.3d at 155-56. In Vaval, however, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals *1154 found that the prosecution's breach, which consisted of breach of a promise not to move for an upward departure or to argue where to sentence the defendant within his guidelines range, required a remedy, because the breached promise was unquestionably the centerpiece of the agreement. Id. at 156. The court found that, because the prosecution had violated essential provisions of the plea agreement, and because no specific performance of the agreement was (or could be) granted to [the defendant] through a Rule 35 proceeding, the court was required to order some remedy, and the court granted resentencing before The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals has also held that no relief from the prosecution's violation of the plea agreement was appropriate where the sentencing court had refused to impose the enhancement for which the prosecution had improperly argued, in derogation of its promises in a plea agreement. See E.V., 500 F.3d at 755. In E.V., the prosecution's breach was introduction of firearms testimony, despite terms of a plea agreement that none of the offense characteristics contained in U.S.S.G. 2D1.1(b), which includes possession of a dangerous weapon, including a firearm, were applicable. Id. at 752. The reason that no remedy was necessary in that case was that [t]he [district] court adhered to its assurance that there's not going to be a gun enhancement, and did not increase Appellant's base offense level pursuant to section 2D1.1 or enhance his sentence pursuant to section 5K2.6 based on his alleged possession of a weapon. Id. at 755. Thus, there may be circumstances in which, notwithstanding a breach of a plea agreement by the prosecution, the defendant may not be entitled to any relief. b. Dicus's entitlement to relief [4] I find that this is not a case in which no remedy is appropriate, because the prosecution's breach was not minor or technical. See Vaval, 404 F.3d at 155-56. Rather, much as in Vaval, the prosecution's argument for a career offender enhancement was contrary to the no other enhancements provision that was unquestionably the centerpiece of the agreement. Id. at 156. Because the plea agreement was clear, Dicus reasonably expected that the prosecution would not seek a career offender enhancement, and that reasonable expectation was not fulfilled. Id. Thus, Dicus suffered a meaningful detriment when, notwithstanding the no other enhancements provision, the prosecution expressly argued for a career offender enhancement, and some remedy is required. Id.; accord Mosley, 505 F.3d at 809-12 (where there has been a breach of the plea agreement, harmless- error analysis does not apply, and the court must consider the proper remedy). 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 11 \f U.S. v. Dicus, 579 F.Supp.2d 1142 (2008) I also find that this is not a case in which no remedy is appropriate, because the sentencing court declined to impose the sentencing enhancement for which the prosecution improperly argued, which, in this case, was the then- applicable career offender enhancement, based on Dicus's 1992 OWI 3rd. See E.V., 500 F.3d at 755 (no relief from the prosecution's violation of the plea agreement was appropriate, because the sentencing court had refused to impose the enhancement for which the prosecution had improperly argued, in derogation of its promises in a plea agreement). Here, the sentencing court did not save Dicus from the consequences of the prosecution's improper actions, an intervening change in the law did. I agree with Dicus that the prosecution should not get the benefit of Begay to save it from the consequences of its violation of the plea *1155 agreement, because granting no relief is inappropriate where the defendant has been subjected to a due process violation for which harmless-error analysis is not available. See Santobello, 404 U.S. at 257, 92 S.Ct. 495 (allowing the government to breach a promise that induced a guilty plea violates due process to which harmless-error analysis does not apply); Sanchez, 508 F.3d at 460 ( Due process may be violated if there is a breach of a promise that induced a guilty plea. ); Mosley, 505 F.3d at 810-812 (breach of a plea agreement is a due process violation to which harmless-error analysis does not apply); E.V., 500 F.3d at 751 (violation of a plea agreement violates due process). Granting no relief is also inappropriate, because it would do nothing to deter prosecutorialmisconduct or to give defendants an incentive to raise prosecutorialmisconduct claims. See, e.g., Sonja Starr, 3 Sentence Reduction as a Remedy for ProsecutorialMisconduct (hereinafter Starr, Sentence Reduction ), 2 & n. 10 (unpublished draft, September 2, 2008; used by permission) (citing Guido Calabresi, The Exclusionary Rule, 26 HARV. J.L. & PUB. POL'YY 111, 116-17 (2003), and Harry M. Caldwell and Carol A. Chase, The Unruly Exclusionary Rule, 78 MARQ. L.REV.. 45, 68-71 (1994), as suggesting that the appropriate remedy for prosecutorialmisconduct should be the combination of direct sanctions against the police, such as fines, to deter misconduct, with sentence reductions, to give defendants an incentive to raise misconduct claims). Moreover, [p]rosecutorialmisconduct has been a widespread and widely criticized problem in the U.S. criminal justice system for decades, albeit one for which existing remedies are ineffective, largely because they are rarely invoked. Id. at 4 & 1. For example, as the Second Circuit Court of Appeals observed more than two decades ago, Given this Court's unwillingness to use reversals as a means of disciplining prosecutors, threats to do so seem unlikely to have much effect. As a practical matter, prosecutors know that courts are reluctant to overturn convictions because of improper [conduct]. United States v. Modica, 663 F.2d 1173, 1183 (2d Cir.1981) (cited in Starr, Sentence Reduction, at 13). The problem cannot continue to go unremedied by the courts, so that some relief from prosecutorialmisconduct is appropriate in this case. c. Inadequacy of the typical remedies here Courts have recognized that there may be circumstances in which one or the other of the preferred remedies for the prosecution's breach of a plea agreement-specific performance of the breached provision or withdrawal of the defendant's guilty plea-is inadequate. For example, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals has recognized that, where the defendant has already served a considerable portion of his sentence, so that permitting the withdrawal of his plea would be an empty remedy, or where the defendant sought specific performance because he did not want to withdraw his guilty plea, the court should not impose a remedy against the non-breaching party's will or a remedy that would be no remedy at all. See United States v. Williams, 510 F.3d 416, 427 (3d Cir.2007) (citing United States v. Badaracco, 954 F.2d 928, 941 (3d Cir.1992), as the first example, and Nolan-Cooper, 155 F.3d at 241, as the second). Thus, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals recognized that an exception to a typical remedy was appropriate, when the circumstances dictate that there is only one appropriate remedy for the [non-breaching] defendant, although the exception was simply to default to the other typical remedy. Id.; see also *1156 United States v. VanDam, 493 F.3d 1194, 1206 (10th Cir.2007) ( Although the choice of remedy rests with the court rather than the defendant, the court would grant the defendant's request for resentencing, rather than requiring him to withdraw of his guilty plea, because [w]hen ... the defendant does not seek to withdraw his guilty plea, the less dramatic remedy of resentencing appears to be most apt. ). 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 12 \f U.S. v. Dicus, 579 F.Supp.2d 1142 (2008) [5] Here, however, the circumstances are exceptional in that neither of the typical remedies would provide adequate relief. Requiring specific performance of the breached term of the plea agreement would grant Dicus no relief whatsoever, because, in the interim between the prosecution's breach of the plea agreement and Dicus's sentencing hearing, the Supreme Court had mooted the issue of whether Dicus could be subjected to the career offender enhancement he was trying to avoid by entering into the plea agreement. See Begay, --- U.S. ----, 128 S.Ct. 1581 (holding that a felony offense of driving while under the influence of alcohol is not a violent felony within the meaning of the Armed Career Criminal Act); Heikes, 525 F.3d at 664 (recognizing that the decision in Begay means that a felony offense of driving while under the influence of alcohol cannot be the basis for a career offender sentencing enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. 4B1.1). Similarly, granting Dicus the opportunity to withdraw his guilty plea would likely result in prejudice to Dicus, rather than any relief from the prosecution's misconduct, as he would have to commence the whole process anew, admittedly without any possibility of a career offender enhancement, but equally without any assurance that the prosecution will not contest his adjusted offense level of 25. Under these circumstances, it is inappropriate to foist upon the defendant a remedy of allowing him to withdraw his guilty plea, because he does not seek such a remedy, even if specific performance of the breached term of the plea agreement would provide him with no relief. Cf. Williams, 510 F.3d at 427 (holding that the court should not impose a remedy against the non-breaching party's will, so that the defendant, who did not want to withdraw his guilty plea, should be resentenced pursuant to the terms of the breached plea agreement). Thus, in this case, the recognized remedies for the prosecution's breach of the plea agreement provide no relief at all. The question is, what remedies are available in such circumstances? d. The touchstones for the appropriate remedy Although the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, like other courts, has explicitly recognized only the typical remedies of specific performance or withdrawal of a guilty plea for the prosecution's breach of a plea agreement, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals has recognized that the determination of the appropriate remedy is typically left to the discretion of the court, and that enforcement of the agreement and withdrawal of the guilty plea are [a]mong the options available to the court. United States v. Fowler, 445 F.3d 1035, 1038 (8th Cir.2006) (emphasis added); see also E.V., 500 F.3d at 754 ( When the government breaches a plea agreement, the defendant is typically given the option of withdrawing his guilty plea or demanding specific performance. ) (emphasis added) (quoting Goings, 200 F.3d at 544). 4 This language appears to me to recognize that, in appropriate circumstances, *1157 the court can consider sanctions for the prosecution's breach of a plea agreement beyond the recognized remedies of ordering specific performance of the breached provision or allowing the defendant to withdraw his guilty plea. Similarly, as I read the Supreme Court's decision in Santobello, that case does not stand for the proposition that specific performance or withdrawal of a guilty plea are necessarily the only remedies available for the prosecution's violation of a plea agreement, even though those were the only two remedies expressly discussed in that case. See Santobello, 404 U.S. at 262-63, 92 S.Ct. 495. In remanding the case to the state court to determine, in its discretion, which remedy was appropriate, the Supreme Court explained that its concern was to best serve the interests of justice and appropriate recognition of the duties of the prosecution in relation to promises made in the negotiation of pleas of guilty. Id. I believe that the interests of justice and appropriate recognition of the duties of the prosecution in relation to promises made in the negotiation of pleas of guilty, therefore, should be the touchstones in determining the appropriate remedy for the prosecution's breach of a plea agreement. I also believe that a wider range of remedies should be considered, in appropriate cases, because breach of a plea agreement is a due process violation that is sufficiently serious that harmless-error analysis does not apply. Mosley, 505 F.3d at 810;see also id. at 812(Santobello holds that harmless-error analysis does not apply). If the typical remedies provide no relief, then failing to award any other relief suggests, in effect, that there has been no harm from the breach to be remedied, and the absence of other relief denigrates the due process right that has been violated. Santobello, 404 U.S. at 257, 92 S.Ct. 495 (allowing the government to breach a promise that induced a guilty plea violates due process); Sanchez, 508 F.3d at 460 ( Due process 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 13 \f U.S. v. Dicus, 579 F.Supp.2d 1142 (2008) may be violated if there is a breach of a promise that induced a guilty plea. ); E.V., 500 F.3d at 751 (violation of a plea agreement violates due process). e. The appropriate remedy here Here, using what I find from Santobello to be the touchstones for determination of the appropriate relief for the prosecution's breach of a plea agreement, I cannot find that the interests of justice or appropriate recognition of the duties of the prosecution in relation to promises made in the negotiation of pleas of guilty, Santobello, 404 U.S. at 262-63, 92 S.Ct. 495, will be served by according Dicus no relief on the ground that he has obtained what he sought in the plea agreement's no other enhancements provision. It is true that Dicus obtained what he sought in the plea agreement-avoidance of a career offender enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. 4B1.1 because of his 1992 OWI 3rd conviction-but because of an intervening change in the law wrought by Begay, --- U.S. ----, 128 S.Ct. 1581. The situation might be different, if Dicus had already been sentenced, and the sentencing court had declined to impose the then-applicable career offender enhancement, based on Dicus's 1992 OWI 3rd, notwithstanding the prosecution's improper argument for such an enhancement in derogation of its promises in the plea agreement. See E.V., 500 F.3d at 755 (no relief from the prosecution's violation of the plea agreement was appropriate, because the sentencing court had refused to impose the enhancement for which the prosecution had improperly argued, in derogation of its promises in a plea agreement). Here, however, I agree with Dicus that the prosecution should not get the benefit of Begay to save it from the consequences of its violation of the plea agreement, because granting no relief in these circumstances simply will not recognize *1158 the duties of the prosecution in relation to promises made in the negotiation of pleas of guilty. The situation also might be different, if the prosecution's violation of the plea agreement had been less egregious, but it was egregious, and thus, undermined the whole system of trust upon which plea negotiations must be based. Again, granting no relief in these circumstances will not recognize the duties of the prosecution in relation to promises made in the negotiation of pleas of guilty, nor will it serve the interests of justice, which are best served by granting relief from egregious misconduct. Moreover, as I mentioned above, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Iowa is a repeat offender, where just before the breach of the plea agreement occurred in this case, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals had held that, in another case before Chief Judge Reade, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Iowa had also breached a plea agreement by seeking sentencing determinations contrary to stipulations in the plea agreement. See Mosley, 505 F.3d at 808-09 (handed down October 12, 2007, just over a month before the prosecution filed its sentencing memorandum in this case on November 21, 2007, in which the prosecution sought application of the career offender sentencing provision contrary to the stipulations in the plea agreement). Both the interests of justice and recognition of the duties of the prosecution in relation to promises made in the negotiation of pleas of guilty require a response to the repeated misconduct of the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Iowa. Under the circumstances of this case, I believe that an appropriate remedy for the prosecution's misconduct-that is, a remedy that serves both the interests of justice and shows appropriate recognition of the duties of the prosecution in relation to promises made in the negotiation of pleas of guilty, Santobello, 404 U.S. at 262-63, 92 S.Ct. 495-is to reduce Dicus's sentence to the low end of his advisory sentencing guidelines range. This is so, notwithstanding that, in the absence of such prosecutorialmisconduct, I would very likely have sentenced Dicus at the top end of the range based on his repeated sales of marijuana to minors. I find that such a remedy is appropriate, because it is likely to have a deterrent effect on prosecutorialmisconduct, to provide an incentive to defendants to raise misconduct claims, and to serve other salutary goals. 5 *1159 First, precisely because this remedy provides a tangible consequence for the prosecution's misconduct, which the usual remedies for breach of a plea agreement do not in this case, this remedy serves the interests of justice by reinforcing that there must be consequences for violation of a defendant's due process rights, and the remedy also relates directly to the prosecution's duties in relation to promises made in the negotiation of pleas of guilty, because it recognizes that the prosecution's breached promise was an inducement to the defendant's guilty plea. Santobello, 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 14 \f U.S. v. Dicus, 579 F.Supp.2d 1142 (2008) 404 U.S. at 262-63, 92 S.Ct. 495 (identifying the interests that the proper remedy should serve). Most scholars have assumed that prosecutors generally prefer higher sentences, and the existing empirical evidence supports that conclusion. Starr, Sentence Reduction, at 23 (citing Stephen F. Smith, Proportionality and Federalization, 91 VA. L.REV. 879, (2005) 879, 896, 928 (2005); Jeffrey Standen, Plea Bargaining in the Shadow of the Guidelines, 81 CAL. L.REV. 1471, 1480 (1993); and Albert Altschuler, Prosecutor's Role in Plea Bargaining, 36 U. CHI. L.REV.. 50, 52 (1968)). Indeed, my own experience over fourteen years and the sentencing of over 2,600 defendants does nothing to suggest that the assumption that prosecutors in this District prefer higher sentences is wrong. Thus, a sentence reduction is likely to be an effective deterrent to prosecutorialmisconduct. There is also a symmetry to such a remedy, which grants a defendant a sentence reduction for the prosecution's post- plea misconduct, where the United States Sentencing *1160 Guidelines are replete with provisions that impose a sentence increase upon a defendant for his post-plea misconduct. Indeed, the United States Attorney's Office in this District frequently attempts to increase a defendant's sentence for alleged post-plea misconduct. In answer to the suggestion that such a sanction visits upon the client, the United States, the sins of the attorney, whereas the Sentencing Guidelines visit upon the client the consequences of his own misconduct, I would respond that I am sanctioning egregious conduct by an Assistant United States Attorney in his official capacity and, in that respect, I am sanctioning conduct that is conduct by the executive branch of the United States. No other sanction would be a deterrent to official misconduct, because a fine against the prosecutor personally would inflict a private sanction for official misconduct, and a fine against the United States would be no deterrent at all, no matter how large. Second, such a remedy provides an important incentive to defendants to raise issues of prosecutorialmisconduct. Cf. Starr, Sentence Reduction, at 2 & n. 10 (citing commentators who have suggested that the appropriate remedy is a combination of sanctions, including sentence reductions, to deter misconduct and to give defendants an incentive to raise misconduct claims). This is so, because, just as a sentence reduction provides a tangible consequence for the prosecution's misconduct, it provides a tangible benefit to the wronged defendant. Such a remedy also serves the interests of justice by vindicating the defendant's due process rights in a way that relates directly to the prosecution's duties in relation to promises made in the negotiation of pleas of guilty, where such a remedy recognizes that the prosecution's breached promise was an inducement to the defendant's guilty plea. Santobello, 404 U.S. at 262-63, 92 S.Ct. 495 (identifying the interests that the proper remedy should serve). Even in cases in which a defendant may have some incentive to assert prosecutorialmisconduct, it is rare that the defendant's counsel does not have some disincentives for asserting such a claim arising from the possibility of friction in future relations with the prosecutor's office in question, which could result in a detriment to other clients. This case was unique in that Dicus's sentencing hearing was defense counsel's last appearance in a federal criminal case before retiring, after thirty-two years of very impressive service to the legal profession, so that defense counsel was in the unique and unusual position of having nothing to fear for future clients from arguing for some relief for Dicus from prosecutorialmisconduct in his case. Thus, the availability of a remedy that is less disruptive than withdrawal of a guilty plea may help to overcome the disincentives that defense counsel may otherwise face to raising a claim of prosecutorialmisconduct, at the same time that the availability of such a remedy may increase the incentives for defendants to raise such claims and may increase the incentives for courts to sanction such misconduct, for the reasons explained just below. Third, such a remedy not only avoids the inadequacies of the typical remedies, it avoids a remedy that would appear to be excessive or a windfall to the defendant, such as dismissal of the indictment, thereby removing one explanation for the failure of courts to respond to prosecutorialmisconduct. As Professor Starr has observed, them as for Current remedies prosecutorialmisconduct are strikingly ineffective, largely because courts view too costly to grant. Scholars too often have been unrealistic about this remedial deterrence proposing stronger remedies for misconduct when the more realistic solution might be nominally weaker ones. Adding sentence reduction *1161 to current all-or-nothing remedial schemes could help to deter and problem, 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 15 \f U.S. v. Dicus, 579 F.Supp.2d 1142 (2008) condemn prosecutorialmisconduct, while avoiding the social costs of retrial and providing a fair measure of relief to defendants whose rights have been violated. Starr, Sentence Reduction at 55. Thus, a sentence reduction may be more palatable for the court to impose than other, more typical remedies for prosecutorialmisconduct. Moreover, in this case, a sentence reduction is more appropriate, in my view, than foisting withdrawal of his plea on Dicus, which he does not want and which could work to his detriment, or doing nothing, because specific performance is no longer an option. Cf. Williams, 510 F.3d at 427 (holding that the court should not impose a remedy against the non- breaching party's will, so that the defendant, who did not want to withdraw his guilty plea, should be resentenced pursuant to the terms of the breached plea agreement). Finally, the interests of justice from a public perspective are also served by imposing a sentence reduction as a sanction for the prosecution's violation of a plea agreement, where, as here, notwithstanding the reduction for prosecutorialmisconduct, the sentence imposed still falls within the advisory guidelines range and is, therefore, presumptively reasonable on appeal. See Rita v. United States, 551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2465, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007); Gall v. United States, 552 U.S. 38, ----, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); United States v. Whiting, 522 F.3d 845, 849 (8th Cir.2008). 6 The interests of justice from both the defendant's and the public's perspective are also served, where, for the reasons explained below, the reduced sentence imposed as a sanction still serves the purposes of sentencing without regard to remedying prosecutorialmisconduct. Therefore, as a sanction for the prosecution's violation of the plea agreement in this case, I sentence Dicus to 70 months imprisonment, the low end of his advisory guidelines range. C. Reasonableness Of The Resulting Sentence [6] Because I have reduced Dicus's sentence as a sanction for prosecutorialmisconduct, I must determine whether the resulting sentence in this case, as in any other case not involving such a sanction, still serves the purposes of sentencing, without regard to remedying prosecutorialmisconduct. As explained above, there are no remaining objections to the calculation of Dicus's advisory guidelines range. Thus, the focus is the reasonableness of the sentence that I have ultimately imposed, after calculation of Dicus's advisory guidelines range. 1. The reasonableness analysis As the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals very recently reiterated, review the imposed sentence *1162 We for reasonableness, first ensur[ing] that the district court committed no significant procedural error. Gall v. United States, 552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); see also Whiting, 522 F.3d at 849. If the district court's decision is procedurally sound, we proceed to review the sentence for substantive reasonableness under an abuse of discretion standard. Gall, 128 S.Ct. at 597;Whiting, 522 F.3d at 849. We may apply a presumption of reasonableness to a sentence within the properly calculated guideline range but are not required to do so. See Rita v. United States, 551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2465, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007); Gall, 128 S.Ct. at 597;Whiting, 522 F.3d at 849. In imposing a sentence under 18 U.S.C. 3553(a), a sentencing court abuses its discretion if it fails to consider a relevant factor that should have received significant weight, gives significant weight to an improper or irrelevant factor, or considers only the appropriate factors but commits a clear error of judgment in weighing those factors. United States v. Watson, 480 F.3d 1175, 1177 (8th Cir.2007). United States v. Brown, 539 F.3d 835, 841-42 (8th Cir.2008). As the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals has also explained, Substantive sentencing acts include, most importantly, how a district court balances the 3553(a) sentencing factors to derive its sentence. United States v. Saddler, 538 F.3d 879, 889 (8th Cir.2008) (quoting United States v. Tabor, 531 F.3d 688, 691 (8th Cir.2008)). 2. The balance of the 3553(a) factors Section 3553(a) of Title 18 provides that [t]he court shall impose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes set forth in paragraph (2) of 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 16 \f U.S. v. Dicus, 579 F.Supp.2d 1142 (2008) this subsection, giving consideration to various enumerated factors. 18 U.S.C. 3553(a). After considering the balance of the pertinent 3553(a) factors, see Saddler, 538 F.3d at 889 (such balance is the most important substantive sentencing act), I find that a 70-month sentence is appropriate. In particular, such a sentence is appropriate in light of the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant, 18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(1), including prior convictions, which fully justify a sentence within the advisory guidelines range; the need for the sentence imposed, 18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(2), which here arises in large part from the extent and frequency of the defendant's illegal conduct; the kinds of sentences available, 18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(3); the kinds of sentence and the sentencing range established for Dicus's offenses, 18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(4) (A); pertinent policy statements, 18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(5); and the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct, including in this case Dicus's wife, who received a 48-month sentence in this case, 18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(6). in that the alternative, I believe Indeed, albeit the prosecution's breach of a plea agreement may properly be considered as a 3553(a) factor in determining the defendant's sentence. This is so, because 3553(a)(1) requires the court to consider, inter alia, the defendant's history. 18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(1). The defendant's post-plea history presumably includes not only his own conduct, but the conduct of the prosecution toward him. In other words, wrongs done to the defendant post-plea seem to me to be just as relevant to determination of the defendant's sentence as any wrongs done by the defendant post-plea. For that reason, I believe that I could properly consider the prosecution's *1163 breach of the defendant's plea agreement as part of his history pursuant to 3553(a)(1) in determining the appropriate sentence. More specifically, as to the purposes set forth in subsection (2), I find that a sentence of 70 months is sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to reflect the seriousness of and to provide just punishment for Dicus's offenses of conspiracy to distribute and to possess with intent to distribute marijuana within 1,000 feet of a playground in violation of 21 U.S.C. 841(a)(1), 846, and 860 in Count 1, and being an unlawful user of marijuana and a felon in possession of ammunition in violation of 18 U.S.C. 922(g)(1), 922(g)(3), and 924(a)(2), in Count 5, and also sufficient to promote respect for the law, because the term of imprisonment is far from insignificant in comparison to the crimes to which Dicus has pleaded guilty. See18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(2)(A). I also find that such a sentence will afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct, again, because it is far from insignificant in comparison to the crimes to which Dicus has pleaded guilty. See18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(2) (B). Next, I find that such a sentence will protect the public from further crimes of the defendant, not only because of the length of his incarceration, but because of the opportunity that the term of imprisonment will provide for him to obtain drug treatment and to work toward rehabilitation. See18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(2)(C). Finally, I find such a sentence will provide Dicus with needed educational or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment, including the 500-hour residential drug treatment program, in the most effective manner. See18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(2)(D). Thus, I reiterate my conclusion that a sentence of 70 months imprisonment is reasonable in this case. III. CONCLUSION In this case, I find that a reduction in the defendant's sentence, albeit one to the low end of his advisory guidelines range, when I would otherwise have sentenced him to the high end, is the appropriate remedy for the prosecution's serious violation of the defendant's plea agreement. Such a remedy provides both deterrence for the prosecution's misconduct and an incentive to defendants to raise such misconduct. Such a remedy also serves the interests of justice and shows appropriate recognition of the duties of the prosecution in relation to promises made in the negotiation of pleas of guilty. Santobello, 404 U.S. at 262-63, 92 S.Ct. 495. Finally, the reduced sentence in this case still serves the purposes of sentencing, upon consideration of the pertinent 3553(a) factors, in that it is sufficient, but no greater than necessary, to achieve all of the appropriate sentencing purposes. THEREFORE, I reiterate my conclusion at the September 9, 2008, sentencing hearing that defendant David Dicus should be sentenced to 70 months imprisonment, the low end of his advisory guidelines sentencing range, as a sanction for the prosecution's serious and recidivist violation of the defendant's plea agreement. 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Footnotes 1 2 3 4 5 Tami Dicus, Dicus's wife, was charged as a co-defendant on Counts 1, 3, and 4, and as the sole defendant on Count 2, which charged her with distribution of marijuana to a person under the age of twenty-one within 1,000 feet of a playground in violation of 21 U.S.C. 841(a)(1), 859, and 860. Nor are these the only two incidents of serious prosecutorialmisconduct in this District during my tenure as a United States District Court Judge. Although there are other examples of serious prosecutorialmisconduct in this District, it is not necessary to catalogue them for purposes of the present ruling. Sonja Starr is an Assistant Professor at the University of Maryland School of Law. Admittedly, in E.V., the court departed from these typical remedies by not granting any relief, because it was clear beyond doubt that the government's breach did not impact Appellant's sentence. E.V., 500 F.3d at 755 (quoting Goings, 200 F.3d at 544). Even so, E.V. suggests that atypical remedies may be available. I note Professor Starr's observation that [s]entence reduction is an accepted remedy in a number of jurisdictions for a variety of kinds of violations of criminal defendants' rights, having been approved, for example, by the European Court of Human Rights, some European domestic courts, several Canadian provincial supreme courts, and the Appeals Chamber of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, although it is essentially unknown in U.S. courts. Starr, Sentence Reduction, at 1. I also note, however, that reference to foreign law has been a controversial issue of late. See, e.g., David S. Law, Globalization and the Future of Constitutional Rights, 102 NW. U.L.REV. 1277, 1279-80 (2008) (noting that there has been a torrential outpouring of literature on the propriety of judicial citation to foreign law, prompted by the Supreme Court's use of foreign authority in a recent string of controversial cases, and citing numerous examples); Mark Tushnet, When is Knowing Less Better Than Knowing More?: Unpacking the Controversy Over Supreme Court Reference to Non-U.S. Law, 90 Minn. L.Rev. 1275, 1276 (2006) (noting this controversy). The fiery debate over the issue has engaged even United States Supreme Court Justices. Compare Confirmation Hearing on the Nomination of Samuel Alito to the United States Supreme Court, 2006 WL 53273 ( I don't think that we should look to foreign law to interpret our own Constitution. I agree with you that the laws of the United States consist of the Constitution and treaties and laws and, I would add, regulations that are promulgated in accordance with law. And I don't think that it's appropriate or useful to look to foreign law in interpreting the provisions of our Constitution. I think the framers would be stunned by the idea that the Bill of Rights is to be interpreted by taking a poll of the countries of the world. ); Confirmation Hearing on the Nomination of John G. Roberts, Jr., to be Chief Justice of the United States Before the S. Comm. on the Judiciary, 109th Cong. 200, 200-01 (2005) (Statement of then Judge Roberts) ( In foreign law you can find anything you want. If you don't find it in the decisions of France or Italy, it's in the decisions of Somalia or Japan or Indonesia or wherever. As somebody said in another context, looking at foreign law for support is like looking out over a crowd and picking out your friends. You can find them, they're there. And that actually expands the discretion of the judge. It allows the judge to incorporate his or her own personal preferences, cloak them with the authority of precedent because they're finding precedent in foreign law, and use that to determine the meaning of the Constitution. I think that's a misuse of precedent, not a correct use of precedent. ); with Roper v. Simmons, 543 U.S. 551, 578, 125 S.Ct. 1183, 161 L.Ed.2d 1 (2005) (Kennedy, J., writing for the majority) ( The opinion of the world community, while not controlling our outcome, does provide respected and significant confirmation for our own conclusions. ); Ruth Bader Ginsburg, A decent Respect to the Opinions of [Human]kind : The Value of a Comparative Perspective in Constitutional Adjudication, Constitutional Court of South Africa (Feb. 7, 2006) (reprinted at http://supremecourtus. gov/publicinfo/speeches/sp_02-07b-06.html) ( Foreign opinions are not authoritative; they set no binding precedent for the U.S. judge. But they can add to the store of knowledge relevant to the solution of trying questions. Yes, we should approach foreign legal materials with sensitivity to our differences, deficiencies, and imperfect understanding, but imperfection, I believe, should not lead us to abandon the effort to learn what we can from the experience and good thinking foreign sources may convey. ). I also note that, as a controversy rages in the United States concerning citation of foreign law, United States decisions have recently been cited less often by foreign courts. See, e.g., United States Court Is Now Guiding Fewer Nations, N.Y. TIMES (Sept. 17, 2008) (online edition at http:// www.nytimes.com/2008/09/18/us/18legal.html? r=2&hp&oref=slogin&oref=slogin). I add that I am not relying on foreign 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 18 \f U.S. v. Dicus, 579 F.Supp.2d 1142 (2008) 6 law sources suggesting reduction of a defendant's sentence as a sanction for prosecutorialmisconduct to support this opinion. I take no position, in this case, on whether still more egregious or malicious prosecutorialmisconduct, or circumstances in which the defendant's conduct did not otherwise justify sentencing him at the top of the advisory guidelines range, might justify reduction of a sentence below the low end of the advisory guidelines range as a sanction for serious prosecutorialmisconduct. However, I do not mean to suggest that the low end of the advisory guidelines range is the lower limit for a sentence reduction as a sanction for serious prosecutorialmisconduct. For example, even a high-end or mid-range guidelines sentence could be reduced below the low end for serious prosecutorialmisconduct, so long as the ultimate sentence was sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to achieve all of the purposes of federal sentencing. Also, even in this case, had I not chosen the high end of the advisory guidelines range to start with, the rationale of this opinion would suggest that a sentence reduction for serious prosecutorialmisconduct could have resulted in a sentence below the bottom of the advisory guidelines range.

Griffin, Law Office of John J. Griffin, Hope C. Lefeber, Philadelphia, PA, for Harold Ford. OPINION POLLAK, District Judge. Before the court is defendant Harold Ford's motion to set aside the verdict on count one of the government's two-count indictment. A jury found Ford guilty of distributing five or more grams of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(b), on November 10, 2005 (Count 1 of the indictment), but acquitted him of count two, distributing five or more grams of cocaine base in a separate incident on November 17, 2005 (Count 2). Ford moves for a judgment of acquittal on count one, pursuant to Rule 29(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, contending that there was not sufficient evidence to support the jury's guilty verdict. Alternatively, in his Rule 29 motion, Ford seeks acquittal on Count 1 on grounds of prosecutorial misconduct. 1 I. Background In November 2005, a Drug Enforcement Administration ( DEA ) task force composed of DEA agents and local police *372 officers was investigating drug trafficking activities in Coatesville, Pennsylvania. Eleven months later, in October 2006, members of the task force arrested Harold Ford; in November 2006, a grand jury returned a two-count indictment. 2 The charges were based on drugs allegedly distributed to a confidential informant, Kevin McKinley. II. Sufficiency of the Evidence Ford argues that the evidence presented to the jury was insufficient to prove, as the indictment charged, that he distributed cocaine base ( crack ) on November 10, 2005. In addressing this claim, the jury's verdict must be upheld if there is substantial evidence from which a rational trier of fact could find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. United States v. Miller, 527 F.3d 54, 60 (3d Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks omitted). This inquiry requires that the court interpret the evidence in the light most favorable to the government as the verdict winner, and do[es] not weigh evidence or determine the credibility of witnesses in making [its] determination. Id. (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). A. The evidence relevant to the count-one distribution charge is as follows: In the fall of 2005, the DEA task force obtained the cooperation of a then-confidential source, Kevin McKinley, in staging undercover drug purchases. McKinley, a Coatesville resident with a lengthy criminal history, including a conviction for drug distribution, 3 had been arrested on September 5, 2005, and again on October 2015 Thomson Reuters.

One of McKinley's arresting officers on October 31, Corporal Chris McEvoy, a Coatesville narcotics officer working with the task force, solicited McKinley's cooperation with the task force's investigation. DEA Agent Brent Wood, who supervised the task force's investigation, testified that, in exchange for his cooperation, McKinley was promised that he would not face state or federal charges in connection with the September and October 2005 arrests. Docket No. 80 (Transcript of Trial, January 25, 2008) at 167. McKinley's cooperation began with an interview on November 7, 2005 about drug trafficking in Coatesville. The interview was conducted in part by Sergeant William Farley, an officer of the University of Pennsylvania Police Department ( UPPD ). Sergeant Farley began working for the UPPD in 2001, after having spent a year working with the park police in Delaware County. Docket No. 79 at 39. At the time that Sergeant Farley interviewed McKinley, in 2005, Farley was assigned to a DEA task force concurrently with his UPPD responsibilities. Docket No. 79 at 39. On November 10, 2005, based on information obtained during the November 7 interview, Sergeant Farley fitted McKinley with a recording device and listened as McKinley made several *373 calls to negotiate drug purchases. 4 Docket No. 79 at 39 42. One of these calls, which was played for the jury during Sergeant Farley's cross examination, was made to Joe Martinez, a local drug dealer, at 11:49 a.m. During this call, McKinley arranged to purchase a half-ounce of crack cocaine in about forty minutes. Docket No. 79 at 81 83. According to Sergeant Farley's testimony, McKinley's conversation with Martinez included discussion of both the quantity and the price of the drugs that were to be purchased. Docket No. 79 at 83, 89. McKinley also called another local drug dealer, Fredrick ( Freddie ) Williams, to arrange the purchase of crack cocaine. McKinley made a third call, at approximately 11:55 a.m. Docket No. 79 at 83 85. This conversation was played for the jury during Sergeant Farley's direct examination. The jury was given a transcript of the conversation that read as follows: SPEAKER 1: Hello SPEAKER 2: Yo where you at? SPEAKER 1: I am just pulling up I just got here they had me there all morning man. SPEAKER 2: Oh you just now ... how did you make out? REDACTED SPEAKER 2: I am ready to come down there, I need you man SPEAKER 1: What's up? SPEAKER 2: I need that I need that A-stem OR I need that I need that H-town 5 SPEAKER 1: Alright SPEAKER 2: Where you at? SPEAKER 1: I am down at the Midway ordering my grill right now. SPEAKER 2: Alright is my sister down there ... hugh SPEAKER 1: She ain't here SPEAKER 2: Alright I will be down SPEAKER 1: Alright Gov't Exh. N 29. On direct examination, McKinley testified that he was the person identified as speaker 2, and Harold Ford was speaker 1. Docket No. 80 at 24. After these conversations, McKinley, outfitted with a concealed transmitter and recording device, and supplied with $400 in buy money, was dropped off in an alley near the Midway Diner, the restaurant referred to in the above conversation. Docket No. 79 at 46 47, 157. McKinley walked to the Midway Diner and arrived there at approximately 12:20 p.m., according to Sergeant Farley's testimony. 6 At *374 trial, McKinley testified that Ford was standing in front of the Midway when he arrived, and that he and Ford discussed 2015 Thomson Reuters.

According to McKinley, Ford instructed McKinley to wait while he went to get the drugs; McKinley further testified that he remember[ed] [Ford] taking too long, and called him to see where he was. 7 Docket No. 79 at 158. However, Sergeant Farley, who had listened to all of McKinley's recorded conversations on November 10, testified on cross-examination that there was no record of a conversation between McKinley and Ford discussing the quantity or price of drugs. Docket No. 79 at 93, 95 96. Sergeant Farley also testified that he had no record of McKinley calling Ford on his cell phone while McKinley was waiting at the Midway Diner. Docket No. 79 at 96. Sergeant Farley further testified that McKinley could not turn off the transmitter or recording device that he was carrying, and that all conversations between McKinley and Ford should have been recorded. Docket No. 79 at 76. McKinley testified that he had not gone inside the Midway Diner before meeting Ford or while waiting for him to return. Docket No. 79 at 160. Sergeant Farley, however, testified that, according to his contemporaneous notes (see footnote 6, supra ), Kevin McKinley, on arriving at the Midway Diner, entered and remained inside for less than two minutes. 8 Docket No. 79 at 87 88. No members of the task force were conducting surveillance inside the Midway Diner. Docket No. 79 at 87 88. McKinley testified that, about five or ten minutes after he called Ford while waiting for him outside the Midway Diner, Ford returned. [Ford] came back walking down the street and came back to me in front of the Midway, and walked west [to] east on the Midway, like off to the side back towards the alley I came from. That's when he handed it to me. Docket No. 79 at 158. McKinley testified that he paid $400 to Ford and received half an ounce of crack cocaine, Docket No. 79 at 160 61, and that the transaction occurred through a handshake: He shakes my hand, give me the stuff, I shake his hand back, give him the money. Docket No. 79 at 161. Overall, according to McKinley's testimony, twenty or twenty-five minutes elapsed between initially meeting Ford outside the Midway Diner and the transaction taking place. Docket No. 79 at 159. Corporal McEvoy testified to having observed Ford and McKinley outside the Midway Diner. Driving in a vehicle different from Sergeant Farley's (six task force vehicles were involved in the operation, Docket No. 79 at 44 45), Corporal McEvoy staked out a position about a block and a half to two blocks east of the Midway Diner to conduct surveillance of McKinley. *375 9 Docket No. 80 at 98 100. Corporal McEvoy testified, on cross-examination, that this position was across a very busy intersection from the Midway Diner and that there were always a lot of people on the street at the location. Docket No. 80 at 126 27. According to Corporal McEvoy, he saw McKinley walk toward the Midway Diner and then meet and engage in a conversation with Ford. Docket No. 80 at 100. Corporal McEvoy said that he observed Ford walking north from the restaurant toward Merchant Street. Docket No. 80 at 100 01. Then, according to Corporal McEvoy, he lost sight of Ford for a number of minutes but saw Ford once more as he walked south and met McKinley again in front of the Midway Diner. Docket No. 80 at 101 02. Corporal McEvoy testified that Ford and McKinley then shook hands and separated after a few more seconds. However, Corporal McEvoy acknowledged that he did not actually observe drugs or money transferred during this handshake, but added that, in his experience, shaking hands is indicative of a drug transaction. 10 Docket No. 80 at 119. During Sergeant Farley's cross-examination, Ford's counsel played a recording of a 12:46 p.m. conversation between McKinley, who was then still in the vicinity of the Midway Diner, and a person the task force could not identify. Docket No. 79 at 89 91. The recording included discussion of prices 350, 370, 380 dollars and references to scales. Docket No. 79 at 91. McKinley testified that this conversation occurred while he was waiting for Ford to return, and that he and the speaker in the conversation were discussing prices for a half ounce of crack cocaine. McKinley further testified that he did not remember the name of the person with whom he had this conversation, but that the person was some young guy. Docket No. 80 at 18 20. A 12:48 p.m. conversation between McKinley and other speakers, one of whom McKinley identified as Ford, was played for the jury while McKinley was on the stand, and a transcript of the conversation (which Sergeant Farley testified to being accurate, (Docket No. 79 at 68 69)), *376 was 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 6 \f U.S. v. Ford, 618 F.Supp.2d 368 (2009) presented to the jury. 11 According to McKinley's testimony, the conversation began with his calling to Ford ( Forte, pronounced forty ) as he was walking from the highway: Oh man you own the highway, you own the highway. Forte I want ... you the big man down here, you worrying about comm' on comm' on man. Gov't Exh. N 28. Then, based on McKinley's identification of the speakers, Docket No. 80 at 21 22, 33, Ford explained to McKinley that he had no drugs on him because he was forced to hide nine ounces of cocaine: I don't got nothing, Ford said. Where you going to be at ... you had coke here, McKinley said. Ford replied, No the cops ... listen I was driving and they started following me, so I had to go and stash it McKinley responded, How much, how much did you stash? Nine ounces. Ford continued, I did ... I cooked it up.... I was scared ... I mean it wasn't outside or nowhere or nothing. Gov't Exh. N 28; Docket No. 80 at 21 22, 33. McKinley testified that this conversation occurred after Ford had brought him the half-ounce of crack cocaine. Docket No. 80 at 23. After the transaction at the Midway Diner had been completed, McKinley returned to the alley where he had been dropped off and got into the van with Sergeant Farley and a task force detective. Docket No. 79 at 161. McKinley gave agents what he testified to be crack cocaine. Docket No. 79 at 161. DEA Forensic Chemist Ken Fuentecilla later tested and weighed the substance and, at trial, testified that the substance was 12.7 grams of cocaine base. Docket No. 79 at 125. On cross-examination, Mr. Fuentecilla could not identify the substance as crack cocaine, and could not provide a definition of crack cocaine: Cocaine base crack, it's I guess the word crack is a street term. So ... none of my analysis are [sic] you know, scientifically, crack means nothing to me really. Docket No. 79 at 132 33. Mr. Fuentecilla was also *377 unable to offer a distinction between freebase cocaine and crack cocaine: Q. Cocaine base, freebase is not referred to on the street as crack, correct? A. I don't know street terms. Docket No. 79 at 133. On further cross-examination, after some pressing, Mr. Fuentecilla acknowledged that his report of the substance did not indicate the presence of hydrochloride or bicarbonates. 12 Docket No. 79 at 137. B. Ford makes two substantial-evidence claims. First, Ford argues that there is not substantial evidence showing that he rather than one of the other individuals from whom McKinley arranged to purchase drugs on November 10, 2005 distributed cocaine base to McKinley that day. Alternatively, Ford argues that there is insufficient evidence from which to conclude that the substance that McKinley purchased that day was crack, rather than another form of cocaine base. For the reasons that follow, I find these arguments unpersuasive. 1. [1] In order to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Ford distributed cocaine base on November 10, a factfinder must credit Kevin McKinley's testimony. McKinley testified that, on November 10, outside the Midway restaurant, Ford gave him a half-ounce of cocaine base in exchange for $400. However, despite the task force's extensive surveillance of McKinley's activities on November 10, there are no recordings or contemporaneous documentation corroborating McKinley's testimony that, via a quick handshake, he and Ford exchanged drugs for money. The nearest thing to corroboration is Corporal McEvoy's testimony that, from across a very busy intersection, he saw a handshake; but he did not see a transfer or drugs and money. Aside from McKinley's testimony that he purchased crack cocaine from Ford on November 10, the evidence that gives strongest support for the jury's verdict is the 11:55 a.m. telephone conversation that day between McKinley and Ford. Viewed in the light most favorable to the government, this call shows that Ford agreed to sell cocaine base to McKinley, and let McKinley know that he was at the Midway Diner. However, Ford and McKinley did not discuss when the transaction would actually occur and, minutes before this call was placed, McKinley called Joe Martinez, who specifically 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 7 \f U.S. v. Ford, 618 F.Supp.2d 368 (2009) agreed to sell drugs to McKinley within forty minutes of the call. McKinley arrived at the Midway diner approximately thirty minutes after this call to Martinez. Hence, if one were to disbelieve McKinley's testimony, but nonetheless credit the testimony of each of the other government witnesses, the evidence would not support a finding beyond a reasonable doubt that Ford, rather than Martinez or another individual, distributed cocaine base to McKinley outside the Midway restaurant on November 10. Moreover, in addition to McKinley's call to Martinez, other evidence casts doubt on whether McKinley testified accurately that Ford, rather than another person, distributed drugs to him outside the Midway restaurant. According to Sergeant Farley's contemporaneous notes, when McKinley arrived at the restaurant, he went inside, where he was completely free from surveillance, for approximately two minutes. *378 13 McKinley then met Ford outside the restaurant and, after a moment, Ford left. McKinley testified that, when Ford first arrived at the restaurant, they discussed the price and volume of the drug purchase. Sergeant Farley testified, however, that all conversations between McKinley and Ford should have been recorded, and that McKinley did not have the ability to turn off the recording instruments that were concealed on him. Likewise, although McKinley testified to calling Ford while waiting for him to return to the restaurant with the drugs, Sergeant Farley testified that there is no record of such a call having been made. There is, however, a recorded conversation between McKinley and a person whom McKinley did not identify at trial about the price of a half-ounce of crack cocaine. This conversation which, according to McKinley, occurred while he was still waiting for Ford to return with the drugs took place at 12:46 p.m. It is even more difficult to reconcile McKinley's testimony with what was next recorded. At 12:48 p.m., within two minutes of the drug negotiation between McKinley and the unidentified person, McKinley called out to Ford, who was walking from the highway ( Oh man you own the highway, you own the highway ). In this conversation, Ford explained to McKinley that he don't got nothing, and that he was forced to stash nine ounces of cocaine because he was being followed by police. While McKinley testified that the 12:46 pm drug negotiation occurred before he met Ford, he also testified that this 12:48 p.m. conversation wherein Ford explains that he did not have any drugs with him occurred after Ford dealt him a half-ounce of crack cocaine. The government offered no explanation for this discrepancy. [2] If, in light of this evidence, one were to discredit McKinley's testimony that Ford distributed the drugs that McKinley purchased on November 10, the weight of the evidence would not support the jury's verdict of guilty on Count 1 of the indictment. However, despite the jury's acquittal of Ford on Count 2, presumably manifesting jury rejection of McKinley's testimony with respect to the alleged November 17 distribution, I am precluded from assessing the credibility of McKinley's testimony that he purchased cocaine base from Ford on November 10. See Miller, 527 F.3d at 60. *379 The jury's apparent non-crediting of McKinley's testimony about events on November 17 does not destabilize the jury's manifest crediting of McKinley's testimony regarding November 10. The Third Circuit has cautioned that, in the context of a sufficiency-of-the-evidence review, [a] jury is free to believe part of a witness' testimony and disbelieve another part of it[.] United States v. Boone, 279 F.3d 163, 189 (3d Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks omitted). Therefore, I must credit McKinley's testimony as to the November 10 charge as true and, concomitantly, conclude that the weight of the evidence supports the jury's verdict. See United States v. Frampton, 382 F.3d 213, 222 (2d Cir.2004) ( [T]he testimony of a single, uncorroborated eyewitness is generally sufficient to support a conviction, and ... such a principle has deep roots in our system of justice. ) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, under the particularly deferential standard of review that governs sufficiency-of-the-evidence analysis, see United States v. Kellogg, 510 F.3d 188, 202 (3d Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks omitted), I conclude that there is substantial evidence supporting the jury's determination that Ford distributed cocaine base on November 10. 2. Ford also argues that, whether or not there is substantial evidence showing that he distributed cocaine base on November 10, there is insufficient evidence from which to conclude that he distributed a mixture and substance 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 8 \f U.S. v. Ford, 618 F.Supp.2d 368 (2009) containing a detectable amount of cocaine base ( crack ), in violation of 21 U.S.C. 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(b), as charged in count one of the indictment. Crack, as the term is defined in the Sentencing Guidelines, is the street name for a form of cocaine base, usually prepared by processing cocaine hydrochloride and sodium bicarbonate, and usually appearing in a lumpy rocklike form. 14 DEA Forensic Chemist Ken *380 Fuentecilla testified, on cross-examination, that while his tests of the substance distributed to McKinley on November 10 confirmed that it was cocaine base, the tests did not reveal the presence of bicarbonates. Moreover, while Sergeant Farley and McKinley referred to the substance in question as crack, they do not appear to have described the properties of the substance at a level of detail necessary to demonstrate that they were referring to the form of cocaine base generally accepted to be crack cocaine. Therefore, Ford argues, there is insufficient evidence that he distributed cocaine base ( crack ), as charged in count one of the indictment. [3] Ford's arguments are misplaced. The question whether Ford distributed crack, as opposed to another form of cocaine base, has no bearing on whether he may be found liable for violating 21 U.S.C. 841. There is disagreement among the circuit courts as to whether any substance other than crack fits within the definition 841 definition of cocaine base. The Third Circuit, however, hold[s] that, while the term cocaine base means only crack when a sentence is imposed under the Sentencing Guidelines, cocaine base encompasses all forms of cocaine base with the same chemical formula when the mandatory minimum sentences under 21 U.S.C. 841(b)(1) are implicated. United States v. Barbosa, 271 F.3d 438, 467 (3d Cir.2001). Here, the government has established that the substance distributed to McKinley on November 10 was cocaine base. Therefore, whether or not the cocaine base distributed on November 10 was crack, there was evidence submitted to the jury that was consistent with the charge that Ford distributed cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. 841(a) and (b)(1). base distributed could be thought to constitute a substantial variance between the indictment and the evidence adduced at trial. See United States v. McKee, 506 F.3d 225, 231 n. 7 (3d Cir.2007) ( [A]mendments [to an indictment] ... occur when the charging terms of the indictment are altered.... Variances occur when the charging terms are unchanged, but the evidence at trial proves facts materially different from those alleged in the indictment. If a variance between the indictment and the evidence does not alter the elements of the offense charged, we will focus upon whether or not there has been prejudice to the defendant. ) (quoting *381 United States v. Castro, 776 F.2d 1118, 1121 22 & n. 1 (3d Cir.1985)). Ford does not allege such a material variance, and I find none. C. In summary, I conclude that the government's evidence, if credited, would allow a reasonable juror to conclude, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Ford distributed five grams or more of cocaine base on November 10. Therefore, a judgment of acquittal will not be entered. III. Prosecutorial Misconduct [4] Having concluded that Ford is not entitled to a judgment of acquittal, I turn to whether the verdict must be set aside due to prosecutorial misconduct. Because Ford raised his misconduct claims post-trial, they are governed by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33, under which the district court has the discretion to vacate a judgment of conviction if the interest of justice so requires. This interest of justice determination requires me to consider the propriety of the government's conduct and its effect on the verdict based on an independent assessment of the evidence. See United States v. Johnson, 302 F.3d 139, 150 (3d Cir.2002) ( Unlike an insufficiency of the evidence claim, when a district court evaluates a Rule 33 motion it does not view the evidence favorably to the Government, but instead exercises its own judgment in assessing the Government's case. ). The fact that the grand jury alleged distribution of cocaine base ( crack ), and that the government did not establish that the substance distributed was crack, as distinct from some other form of cocaine base, would have the potential to affect the verdict only if the imprecision as to the form of cocaine A. [5] Ford argues that the prosecutor engaged in a pattern of misconduct that included vouching for the credibility of the government's witnesses and lodging unfounded attacks on Ford's counsel-a pattern which, Ford argues, began during 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 9 \f U.S. v. Ford, 618 F.Supp.2d 368 (2009) opening statements and culminated in the prosecutor's closing argument and, in particular, the closing-argument rebuttal. Analysis of these claims involves a two-stage inquiry. First, did the prosecutor's statements, considered in context, constitute misconduct? Second, if misconduct occurred, was it so severe that it may have had an adverse influence on the jury's objectivity in arriving at a verdict? See United States v. Young, 470 U.S. 1, 11, 105 S.Ct. 1038, 84 L.Ed.2d 1 (1985) ( [A] criminal conviction is not to be lightly overturned on the basis of a prosecutor's comments standing alone, for the statements or conduct must be viewed in context; only by doing so can it be determined whether the prosecutor's conduct affected the fairness of the trial. ). Ford preserved his misconduct claims through contemporaneous objections at trial, including repeated requests for a mistrial, and I will therefore review the claims in accordance with the harmless error principles set forth in United States v. Zehrbach, 47 F.3d 1252, 1265 (3d Cir.1995) (en banc) (holding that prosecutorial misconduct amounting to non-constitutional error is harmless when it is highly probable that the error did not contribute to the judgment ) (emphasis in original). See also United States v. Vitillo, 490 F.3d 314, 327 (3d Cir.2007) (reviewing vouching claims for harmless error when defendant objected to the alleged vouching at trial and by post-trial motion ). B. While Ford alleges that the prosecutor engaged in misconduct throughout the course of the trial, the focal point of my analysis will be the prosecutor's remarks during the government's closing-argument rebuttal. Ford's claim based on these remarks must be understood in the context of a trial marred by considerable tension and, at times, open hostility, between the prosecutor and the defense counsel. Therefore, before addressing Ford's misconduct claims, I will recapitulate portions *382 of the record that place the prosecutor's remarks in appropriate light. 1. Two loci of tension between the parties were the testimony of Kevin McKinley and Corporal McEvoy. McKinley, the government's cooperator, had a lengthy criminal history that included a conviction for crack-cocaine distribution, 15 a charge for making terroristic threats in 2002, and, based on his having shot into the window of an occupied vehicle, convictions in 2003 for reckless endangerment and carrying an illegal firearm. Docket No. 80 at 62. Seeking to make McKinley's background more palatable to the jury, the prosecutor, in his opening argument, stressed that McKinley was to be respected for testifying at the risk of persons who would have him not testify who would intimidate him. Docket No. 79 at 25. I cautioned the prosecutor that this characterization was a little much. 16 Then, in her opening argument, Ford's counsel addressed McKinley's lengthy criminal history, which she characterized as a lifetime of crime, including [r]obberies, stabbings, drugs, drugs, drugs, and more drugs, and carrying a gun, sticking up people, and terrorizing people with that gun. Docket No. 79 at 29, 31 32. This characterization prompted the prosecutor not only to object, but also to accuse Ford's counsel, in open court, of making something up. 17 Docket No. 79 at 32. *383 Pursuant to both parties' objections, at sidebar I admonished both parties for their comments, stating that Mr. McGettigan [the prosecutor] doesn't need to say that, and I don't think we need to talk about terrifying ... the population. 18 Docket No. 79 at 32. Later, during his direct examination of McKinley, the prosecutor posed the following question to McKinley: Q. Okay, and I noticed you have difficulty walking up here. What's your present physical condition. A. I was shot. Docket No. 79 at 142. This inquiry drew a vigorous objection from Ford's counsel, who, at sidebar, argued that the prosecutor was trying to intimate that McKinley was shot in retaliation for testifying here and [that] he's afraid of people. Docket No. 79 at 143. The prosecutor represented that he was simply trying to explain the cause of McKinley's obvious injury, and that he had no intention of trying in any respect to impute [the shooting] to this defendant, or, at my prompting, to anybody. Docket No. 79 at 143. I cut off the prosecutor's inquiry and issued the following instruction: THE COURT: I think that the jury can disregard the nature of the witness's 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 10 \f U.S. v. Ford, 618 F.Supp.2d 368 (2009) injury. It doesn't figure into this case. He we'll trust he recovers quickly. Docket No. 79 at 144. the prosecutor's questions as As McKinley's direct examination continued, the prosecutor twice, in front of the jury, accused Ford's counsel of inappropriate conduct. First, during McKinley's direct examination, Ford's counsel successfully objected to several of leading. After one of these successful objections, the prosecutor openly complained that Ford's counsel doesn't understand what['s] leading. 19 *384 Docket No. 79 at 164. Second, during McKinley's cross-examination, the prosecutor objected when Ford's counsel inaccurately summarized part of McKinley's testimony. In doing so, the prosecutor accused Ford's counsel, in front of the jury, of intentionally misstating the testimony. Docket No. 80 at 31. I instructed the prosecutor that such editorializing during the objections is unnecessary. 20 Docket No. 80 at 32. The defense's examination of Corporal McEvoy prompted another heated exchange between the prosecutor and Ford's counsel. Corroborating McKinley's testimony that he exchanged drugs and money with Ford through a handshake, Corporal McEvoy testified on direct examination that he saw Ford and McKinley shake hands outside the Midway Diner on November 10. On cross-examination, Ford's counsel called the truthfulness of this testimony into question by highlighting that Corporal McEvoy's contemporaneous notes did not document this handshake or other observations to which he testified. Docket No. 80 at 124. On re-direct examination, the prosecutor asked McEvoy whether he would testify to anything falsely or that [he] did not recollect ... to convict Harold Ford or anybody else, to which Corporal McEvoy responded: Absolutely not. Docket No. 80 at 133. Ford's counsel conducted re-cross examination about this statement, and elicited testimony that Corporal McEvoy failed to inform the government that he was named, with other officers, as a defendant in a lawsuit alleging arrests based on an unlawful search: 21 *385 BY MS. LEFEBER: Q. When in preparation for your testimony here today, did you meet with Mr. McGettigan? [CPL. MCEVOY:] A. Yes, ma'am. Q. And, did he ask you whether or not there are any pending actions against you for false arrests? A. Yes, ma'am. Q. And, did you tell him absolutely not? A. Yes, ma'am. Q. And, that isn't true, is it, sir? A. No, ma'am. Q. There is a pending law suit in this district court house against you for participating in fabricating false arrests, correct? A. Ma'am, I believe your facts are far from true. Q. Well, let's put it this way. There is a pending action against you in your capacity as a Coatesville Police Officer in this United States District Courthouse, is that correct? A. As a member of the Chester County Municipal Drug Task Force, I was one of numerous officers named in a law suit stemming from a search warrant ... which had nothing to do with my testimony, ... false or true. Docket No. 80 at 133 34. In further re-direct examination, the prosecutor attempted to diminish the significance of Corporal McEvoy's omission in the following exchange: BY MR. MCGETTIGAN: Q. Did I ever ask you if you were involved in a law suit? [CPL. MCEVOY:] A. Yes, sir. Q. Did you tell me? A. I told you that I didn't I wasn't aware of anything that was pending against me. Q. Does this suit have anything to do MS. LEFEBER: Objection, Your Honor. There's nothing about what this law suit 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 11 \f U.S. v. Ford, 618 F.Supp.2d 368 (2009) THE COURT: Let's not do you have a question, Mr. McGettigan? BY MR. MCGETTIGAN: Q. Somebody you locked you up sued you, isn't that correct? A. Exactly. Q. Okay. Does that happen sometimes in your line of work? A. Yes, it does. Q. And oh, it was a drug offense they got locked up for too? A. Yes, sir. Q. Thank you very much. Just like this one? A. Yes, sir. THE COURT: Mr. McGettigan, that wasn't a useful remark. MR. MCGETTIGAN: I get [sic] your pardon. Docket No. 80 at 135 36. Tension between counsel was quite high at this point, as evidenced by the prosecutor accusing Ford's counsel, at sidebar, of lying in *386 claiming that Corporal McEvoy was alleged to have participated in the writing of false affidavits in support of the arrests. 22 Docket No. 80 at 136 37. 2. The parties' closing arguments were no less heated. The prosecutor was the first to summarize his case, and he began by recounting a fictional dialogue with an unnamed colleague in the prosecutor's office. In that fictional dialogue, the prosecutor would express his concerns about perceived weaknesses in the government's case, and the colleague would undertake to reassure the prosecutor. 23 Then, after addressing the credibility of the government's witnesses, the prosecutor recited what he characterized principles that apply to criminal cases generally. Docket No. 81 at 15. The prosecutor asserted that, under these general principles, *387 the defense's argument that Ford was not the person who distributed drugs to McKinley on November 10 was a defense of ... last resort. 24 Docket No. 81 at 16. In her closing argument, Ford's counsel challenged the prosecutor's characterization of Ford's defense as one of last resort. Docket No. 81 at 30 31. Ford's counsel then suggested that the government was trying to keep the truth from the jury by having refused, in the course of the trial, to stipulate to the fact that no drugs were found on Ford during his arrest, 25 and by objecting to Ford's request to play the tape of McKinley negotiating a drug transaction outside the Midway Diner during the period when he was, according to his testimony, waiting for Ford to return with the drugs. 26 *388 Docket No. 81 at 31 24. Elaborating on this point, Ford's counsel emphasized that the task force officers' contemporaneous notes did not corroborate McKinley's and McEvoy's testimony, and that other supporting evidence, such as telephone records corroborating McKinley's claim that he called Ford on November 10, just isn't here: They didn't arrest him for a year later, is the excuse. I suggest to you, ladies and gentlemen, they didn't arrest him for a year later, because they didn't believe their own case. Docket No. 81 at 37. Ford's counsel also aggressively questioned the truthfulness of both McKinley's and Corporal McEvoy's testimony. Ford's counsel characterized Corporal McEvoy as having made a deal with the devil in choosing to work with McKinley, Docket No. 81 at 34, and described McKinley's as a man that his entire adult life has engaged in drug dealing, carrying loaded weapons to enforce to get whatever he wanted to get. Recklessly endangering other people with guns. Shooting at people, stalking them, harassing them, assaulting them. Doing whatever he could to get his way. Docket No. 81 at 47 48. McKinley testified against Ford, defense counsel argued, because he realized that the jig [was] up when he was arrested in October 2005. Docket No. 81 at 48. Ford's counsel further argued that what the Government proved here beyond a reasonable doubt, is that Kevin McKinley should be sitting over there charged with the crimes that he committed, and he should be the one facing 30 years to life. Docket No. 81 at 49 50. Then, Ford's counsel urged the jury to ask whether Corporal McEvoy appear[ed] to ... have his own agenda in this case, Docket No. 81 at 50, and pointed to aspects of Corporal McEvoy's testimony that, 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 12 \f U.S. v. Ford, 618 F.Supp.2d 368 (2009) she argued, could support this conclusion. 27 After doing so, Ford's counsel highlighted the *389 prosecutor's question to Corporal McEvoy, on redirect examination, as to whether he would ever lie on the witness stand to convict Harold Ford: from you, well, as a lawyer, you don't have a whole lot, sometimes, but your good name and when you're accused personally . And it was I who had to remind him, oh, no you wouldn't? You lied to Mr. McGettigan when he asked you whether there were any pending cases against you in your capacity as a police officer in Coatesville, for making false affidavits against people to get them arrested. You lied to your own lawyer when he asked you that. And, of course, it's your recollection that counts. But I recall him saying, yeah. I didn't tell him about that. And this is not about that lawsuit, whether or not he lied to get other people arrested. It's not about that. It's about his character for truthfulness and whether or not he would lie to get Harold Ford convicted. And I submit to you, if he lied to his own lawyer, Mr. McGettigan, about a prior lawsuit that we learned are is actually pending in this courthouse, if he lied to his own the lawyer for the Government about that, he's lying to convict Harold Ford. Docket No. 81 at 53 54. 3. Against this background, the prosecutor began his rebuttal, which were the final remarks that the jury heard from either party, as follows: Thank you your Honor. Ladies and gentlemen, when counsel referred to the Government and the Government's lawyer, she was pointing at me. She should have been talking about Officer Corporal McEvoy back there, too. Now, I'm the Government lawyer. I'm not getting rich. If a trial goes a week, I got to wear the same suit twice. Docket No. 81 at 57. The prosecutor continued: Docket No. 81 at 57 58. Ford's counsel objected to this comment. Calling the parties to sidebar, I instructed the parties as follows: THE COURT: Ms. Lefeber, your argument is one that challenges the Government's readiness to present the truth, and so Mr. McGettigan is entitled to respond. The response, I think, should not be extensively personal, Mr. McGettigan.... [I]t's not a personal statement. It's a statement about the *390 Government and what the Government's responses and attitudes and responsibilities are. So, let's, from now on, have no more. Docket No. 81 at 58. The prosecutor's argument continued. After suggesting that the jury should reject the argument that the Government didn't want you to know the truth, the prosecutor, approaching the jury box, said: You know, phone records, that would have been a good idea. It wasn't my idea. But to say that the Government's counsel, the Government sought to conceal the truth from you, I submit goes beyond the pale. As does accusing an honorable, I would submit Docket No. 81 at 59. By this point, the prosecutor was fully facing the jury box and speaking at a volume too quiet to be heard by me or by the court reporter, and the transcript reflects this gap. At my request, the prosecutor continued at a louder volume: But when the Government wants to keep the truth counsel says, 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 13 \f U.S. v. Ford, 618 F.Supp.2d 368 (2009) You saw Officer McEvoy on the witness stand, Corporal McEvoy. And I'm sure you saw much of his much of his head that's visible get a little bit red as he was accused of things. Probably did, again. And you saw him ... accused here. As if he were being paid piecework. And I'd submit to you that he was an honorable police officer doing honorable work. And, instead, for his trouble, you saw him accused of being a liar, as if he would lie to convict Harold Ford. As if the Government's counsel would mislead you to convict Harold Ford. Docket No. 81 at 59 60. Ford's counsel again objected, and I cautioned the prosecutor that we're not going to be pursuing personal lines. Docket No. 81 at 60. The prosecutor then, after explaining that you're going to get called names in his line of profession, offered the following anecdote: I'm reminded by counsel's argument of something that occurred to me, not that long ago. I ran into a defense attorney who I knew and was friends with, from years gone by, and he was about to close to a jury early in the day. I said, hey, Brian, can I buy you lunch? He said, don't wait, it might take me a while to confuse the issue. And that's why I said what I had to say before counsel got up. Docket No. 81 at 60. Then, after addressing the credibility of Kevin's McKinley's testimony, the prosecutor commented on the defendant's failure to testify at trial: In addition, counsel, at one point, I think she said and I made a few notes here, that the defendant said, well, Mr. Ford doesn't have to say anything, and he didn't say anything. He hasn't said a word in this courtroom. So I don't know what she was referring to. Docket No. 81 at 62. The prosecutor went on to address Ford's counsel's suggestion that the government did not believe its own case and, in doing so, characterized the defendant's closing argument as a lot of lawyer noises being made there. 28 Docket No. 81 at 64. *391 Then, responding to the defense's characterization of McKinley's criminal history, the prosecutor revisited McKinley's statement that he had been shot, which I had previously instructed the jury to ignore: Counsel, I believe said, at least once or more than once, that Kevin shot somebody, he was shooting somebody to get whatever he wanted. As I recall, he got shot, not that he shot someone. Docket No. 81 at 65. Ford's counsel objected to this statement, which I overruled by saying I think the jury will remember and decide what was said. It's up to the jury. Docket No. 81 at 65. The prosecutor then continued his closing argument with this remark: At this moment, I'm reminded of a discussion I had outside of a courtroom one time, where I was trying to persuade a number of people, and I was interrupted by my opponent, my adversary in the argument. And eventually, after his second or third time, he said, hey, shut up, Joe you're making sense. Docket No. 81 at 65 66. I then issued another cautionary instruction, and the rest of the prosecutor's rebuttal continued without interruption. [7] Ford contends that, in his rebuttal, the prosecutor C. [6] committed misconduct by vouching for the credibility of the government witnesses and disparaging Ford's counsel. As the Supreme Court has observed in United States v. Young: The prosecutor's vouching for the credibility of witnesses and expressing his personal opinion concerning the guilt of two dangers: such comments can convey the that evidence not presented to the jury, but known to the prosecutor, supports the charges the accused pose impression 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 14 \f U.S. v. Ford, 618 F.Supp.2d 368 (2009) against the defendant and can thus jeopardize the defendant's right to be tried solely on the basis of the evidence presented to the jury; and the prosecutor's opinion carries with it the imprimatur of the Government and may induce the jury to trust the Government's judgment rather than its own view of the evidence. 470 U.S. at 18 19, 105 S.Ct. 1038. According to the Third Circuit, in order to establish that a prosecutor's remarks constitute improper vouching, two criteria must be met: (1) the prosecutor must assure the jury that the testimony of a Government witness is credible; and (2) this assurance is based on either the prosecutor's personal knowledge, or other information not contained in the record.' Kindler v. Horn, 542 F.3d 70, 87 (3d Cir.2008) (quoting United States v. Walker, 155 F.3d 180, 187 (3d Cir.1998)). The defendant must be able to identify as the basis for [the prosecutor's comment on witness credibility] explicit or implicit reference to either the personal knowledge of the prosecuting attorney or information not contained in the record. United States v. Brennan, 326 F.3d 176, 183 (3d Cir.2003) (alterations in original) (quoting Walker, 155 F.3d at 187). Linked to these vouching claims is Ford's contention that the prosecutor impugned the truthfulness of Ford's counsel based on information outside the record. See United States v. Rivas, 493 F.3d 131, 139 (3d Cir.2007) ( [T]he prohibition against personal attacks on attorneys is rooted less in a sense of decorum than in the same rule underlying the prohibition *392 on vouching: one cannot make arguments unsupported by the record evidence. ). The statements that ground this misconduct claim are interwoven with the remarks that, according to Ford, constituted personal assurances by the prosecutor as to the credibility of the government's witnesses. Therefore, in order to avoid drawing an artificial distinction between the contexts in which the remarks arose, I will analyze Ford's misconduct claims based on the prosecutor's disparagement of counsel together with his vouching claims. See, e.g., Young, 470 U.S. at 11, 105 S.Ct. 1038 ( [A] criminal conviction is not to be lightly overturned on the basis of a prosecutor's comments standing alone, for the statements or conduct must be viewed in context; only by doing so can it be determined whether the prosecutor's conduct affected the fairness of the trial. ). 1. The prosecutor's rebuttal was focused on bolstering the credibility of McKinley's and Corporal McEvoy's testimony. This focus was appropriate, as Ford's counsel called the truthfulness of those witnesses' testimony into question. However, in expressing his anger that Ford's counsel challenged the integrity of the government's case, the prosecutor remarks went beyond appealing to the evidence in the record and invoked the prestige of the government's office. [8] First, the prosecutor accused Ford's counsel of going beyond the pale in suggesting that the government was concealing the truth from the jury by failing to provide telephone records corroborating McKinley's testimony and by accusing an honorable officer of testifying untruthfully. Continuing with this argument, the prosecutor undertook to assure the jury that Corporal McEvoy was an honorable police officer and equated the integrity of the challenged law-enforcement-officer witness with integrity of Government counsel i.e., the prosecutor himself: the I'd submit to you that [McEvoy] was an honorable police officer doing honorable work. And, instead, for his trouble, you saw him accused of being a liar, as if he would lie to convict Harold Ford. As if the Government's counsel would mislead you to convict Harold Ford. Docket No. 81 at 60. [9] The government contends that the prosecutor did not, at any point during the course in these remarks, offer a personal opinion as to the credibility of the witnesses. However, a prosecutor's assurance of a witness's credibility is impermissible if it is based on either an explicit or implicit reference to ... the personal knowledge of the prosecuting attorney. See Brennan, 326 F.3d at 183. The Third Circuit has held that prosecutorial remarks that may be construed as invoking the integrity of the government may be appropriate if, when the remarks are considered in context, it is clear that the prosecutor was making a specific argument, based on the 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 15 \f U.S. v. Ford, 618 F.Supp.2d 368 (2009) trial record, about the government's veracity. For example, in Brennan, the court considered a closing argument that the prosecutor initiated by saying that one hallmark of our system is that we don't make accusations without proof. Id. at 185. The court acknowledged that, read in isolation, this remark could be read to suggest that evidence outside the record demonstrated [the defendant's] guilt. Id. However, the court observed that immediately following his assertion that the Government does not make accusations without proof, the prosecutor directed the jury to consider the corroborating evidence and [a witness's] demeanor during his five days of testimony. Id. at 186. Therefore, the Brennan court determined, the statement at issue, *393 taken in context, was a legitimate attack on the defendant's case. Similarly, in United States v. Walker, 155 F.3d 180 (3d Cir.1998), the court held that it was permissible to ask the jury what motivation a testifying officer had to lie in order to draw attention to the lack of evidence supporting the defendant's challenge to the officer's truthfulness. Id. at 186. In this case, by contrast, several of the prosecutor's objected- to remarks during rebuttal particularly his statement that it was beyond the pale for Ford's counsel to challenge the truthfulness of the government's case and his expression of offense ( [a]s if the Government's counsel would mislead you to convict Harold Ford ) were not tethered to the record. When viewed in context a context that includes other, milder forms of vouching 29 as well as the prosecutor's attacks on Ford's counsel and his characterization of the defense's closing argument as an insult to his good name 30 the prosecutor's remarks were, quite plainly, decoupled from the record. Nor is there reason to regard the remarks as simply being regrettable but excusably inartful turns of phrase. They were remarks with the clear potential of artificially magnifying the government's credibility in the eyes of the jury, whether or not they were so intended. Thus, with these statements, the prosecutor went beyond asking the jury what motivation Corporal McEvoy had to lie, or what motivation the government had to withhold the truth, and managed to invoke the government's prestige in bolstering its witnesses' credibility. 31 [10] The prosecutor's remarks, taken in context, thus closely resemble those that the court found improper in United States v. Dispoz O Plastics, Inc., 172 F.3d 275, 283 (3d Cir.1999), where the prosecutor bolstered the credibility of a cooperating witness by assuring the jury that the government *394 does not give two for one deals. They also evoke the remarks that the court found impermissible in United States v. Molina Guevara, 96 F.3d 698, 704 05 (3d Cir.1996), where the prosecutor told the jury that it was insulting and ridiculous' to think that the United States would put on a witness who would lie. See also United States v. DiLoreto, 888 F.2d 996, 998 99 (3d Cir.1989) (holding that vouching occurred where the prosecutor asserted that [w]e [the government] don't take liars. We don't put liars on the stand. We don't do that ), overruled on other grounds by Zehrbach, 47 F.3d 1252 (holding that prosecutorial misconduct is not reversible per se and must be reviewed for harmless error). Here, as in those cases, the prosecutor did not defend the witnesses' credibility based on inferences that could be drawn from the evidence. Instead, the prosecutor relied on the prestige of his office to counter the suspicions that Ford's counsel attempted to convey to the jury through arguments that, while aggressive, were grounded in the record. 32 This is misconduct. 2. [11] Also problematic were the prosecutor's remarks disparaging not just Ford's counsel, but the criminal defense bar more generally. In response to objections by Ford's counsel to the prosecutor's rebuttal, the prosecutor offered the two anecdotes described above, relating tales about how defense attorneys generally try to confuse the issue[s] and prevent government attorneys from making sense. See supra section IIB3 (explaining the content of the prosecutor's rebuttal). These comments were manifestly inappropriate. The anecdotes served no purpose other than to encourage a juror to reject the defendant's arguments based on its skepticism of the criminal defense system, rather than on the strength of the government's evidence. They bore no relationship to the evidence at bar, and they were incompatible with the constraints *395 that guide a prosecutor. See ABA Standards for Criminal Justice (3d ed. 1993) 3 5.8(c) ( The prosecutor should not make arguments calculated to appeal to the prejudices of the jury. ), 3 5.8(d) ( The prosecutor should refrain from argument which would divert the jury from its duty to decide the case on the evidence. ). 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 16 \f U.S. v. Ford, 618 F.Supp.2d 368 (2009) The government argues that these remarks were direct comments on defense tactics, specifically Ford's counsel having interrupted the prosecutor's rebuttal with objections, and therefore they were not improper. Docket No. 89 at 28 29. This is incorrect for three reasons: First, Ford's counsel's objections to the prosecutor's rebuttal were appropriate responses to the prosecutor's remarks and, indeed, necessary to preserve Ford's misconduct claims for review. [12] Second, while the prosecutor may be permitted to comment on specific, inappropriate defense arguments for the purpose of tempering any clearly unwarranted juror suspicions of the government's case that such arguments may give rise to, the prosecutor is not permitted to do so in a way that is itself calculated to inflame the jury's prejudices. See, e.g., Dispoz O Plastics, Inc., 172 F.3d at 284 85 (holding that the invited response doctrine may not be used as a springboard to launch[ ] affirmative attacks upon defendants ). Thus, regardless of whether the prosecutor's observations were uttered in response to what the prosecutor perceived to be an inappropriate defense tactic, the prosecutor engaged in misconduct. Third, the prosecutor's anecdotes do not appear to have been addressed to a specific defense tactic. The prosecutor cast his insults in general terms, and did not comment upon specific behavior by Ford's counsel that he deemed inappropriate. More tellingly, the prosecutor's inappropriate remarks were not isolated responses to perceived defense challenges. Later in his rebuttal, the prosecutor characterized the defense's closing arguments as a lot of lawyer noises being made there. Furthermore, the prosecutor's attacks during rebuttal echoed inappropriate and inflammatory accusations that he earlier made in open court, such as the charge, made during Ford's counsel's opening statement, that she was making something up. 33 *396 Those earlier accusations antedated Ford's counsel's closing argument, which belies the government's argument that the prosecutor's attacks during rebuttal were a measured response to specific defense tactics. I therefore find that the prosecutor's attacks on Ford's counsel and the defense bar generally cannot be justified as comments made in reasonable response to improper attacks by defense counsel. 3. [13] In addition to making personal assurances about the credibility of the government's witnesses and offering inappropriate remarks about Ford's counsel, the prosecutor attempted to bolster McKinley's credibility through evidence outside the record. Early in McKinley's direct examination, the prosecutor elicited testimony that McKinley had been shot, but assured the court that he had no intention of trying in any respect to impute McKinley's shooting to Ford. I instructed the jury to disregard this testimony. Docket No. 79 at 143 44. Nevertheless, in his rebuttal, the prosecutor said: Counsel, I believe said, at least once or more than once, that Kevin shot somebody, he was shooting somebody to get whatever he wanted. As I recall, he got shot, not that he shot someone. Docket No. 81 at 65. The government does not address this comment even though Ford objected to it at trial and raised it in his Rule 29 motion. I nonetheless note that the comment not only refers to testimony the jury was specifically instructed to disregard, but also incorrectly suggests that there was no evidence supporting Ford's counsel's comment, in her opening argument, that McKinley's criminal history included [s]hooting at people. Docket No. 81 at 48. In fact, McKinley testified that he pleaded guilty in 2003 to reckless endangerment for shooting into the window of an occupied vehicle, Docket No. 80 at 62 63. Additionally, this comment by the prosecutor in his rebuttal came at the conclusion of a trial in which the prosecutor repeatedly focused the jury's attention on threats that were allegedly directed toward McKinley. First, in his opening statement, the prosecutor advised the jurors that McKinley cooperated with the government at some apprehension and risk to himself, and that McKinley was testifying at the risk of persons who would have him not testify and who would intimidate him. Docket No. 79 at 24 25. Later, the prosecutor attempted to ask Agent Wood [w]hat would have happened to Kevin McKinley if Harold Ford had been arres[ted] in 2005. Docket No. 80 at 154 55. 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 17 \f U.S. v. Ford, 618 F.Supp.2d 368 (2009) Unfortunately, I must conclude that the prosecutor's rebuttal effectively undermined his prior assurance that he had no intention of trying in any respect to impute [the shooting] to this defendant. I therefore conclude that the prosecutor's reference to McKinley's shooting was made to bolster McKinley's credibility and inflame the jury's prejudices against the defendant based on information not contained in the record. D. Having identified instances of prosecutorial misconduct- improper vouching, inappropriate disparaging of Ford's counsel and the defense bar generally, and prejudicially referring to extra-record information *397 to which Ford raised contemporaneous objections, I must consider whether these claims constituted harmless error. 34 I will undertake this review in accordance with the harmless error standard set forth in Zehrbach: The harmless error doctrine requires that the court consider an error in light of the record as a whole, but the standard of review in determining whether an error is harmless depends on whether the error was constitutional or non- constitutional. In this instance, the alleged error, attacking the credibility of a witness with evidence not in the record, is non-constitutional. We have held that non-constitutional error is harmless when it is highly probable that the error did not contribute to the judgment. High probability requires that the court possess a sure conviction that the error did not prejudice the defendant. 47 F.3d at 1265 (citations omitted; emphasis in original). I will treat defendant's charges as claims of non- constitutional error for the purpose of this review. See, e.g., United States v. Weatherly, 525 F.3d 265, 273 (3d Cir.2008) (reviewing vouching claims for non- constitutional error); but see Molina Guevara, 96 F.3d 698, 705 (3d Cir.1996) (reviewing vouching that allegedly violated a defendant's Sixth Amendment rights for constitutional error). Therefore, having determined that misconduct has occurred, I must consider whether I am left with a sure conviction that the error did not prejudice the defendant. Zehrbach, 47 F.3d at 1265. [14] The test for determining prejudice, under this standard, is tripartite. The factors to be examined are the scope of the comments and their relationship to the proceeding, the extent of any curative instructions, and the strength of the evidence against the defendants. Dispoz O Plastics, Inc., 172 F.3d at 286 (citing Zehrbach, 47 F.3d at 1265). [15] First, as to the scope of the comments made by the prosecutor during rebuttal and their relationship to the proceeding, the prosecutor vouched repeatedly, including when he characterized Ford's defense strategy as one of last resort, Docket 81 at 15 16, and addressed the lawsuit against Corporal McEvoy, by saying that his fictional colleague said, well, weren't you, the defense attorney and the Judge in your last drug case all sued? Docket No. 81 at 12. The prosecutor's attacks on Ford's counsel and his comments alluding to McKinley's shooting and to Corporal McEvoy were plainly intended to bolster McKinley's and McEvoy's testimony. As McKinley was the government's only eyewitness to Ford's distribution of cocaine base on November 10, and the record contained recordings that are not clearly in harmony with McKinley's testimony, any information that would bolster McKinley's credibility including McEvoy's testimony that he observed a handshake between Ford and McKinley could have been pivotal in persuading a jury of Ford's guilt. Cf. Werts v. Vaughn, 228 F.3d 178, 200 (3d Cir.2000) (finding that prosecutor's comments were harmless where they were not based on information *398 not presented to the jury and where the record contained ample evidence of the defendant's guilt). Moreover, the comments at issue occurred during the government's rebuttal, which was the final statement to the jury by either attorney, and could therefore have carried undue weight with the jury as they began their deliberations. Second, I did not issue any specific, curative instructions to address the prosecutor's remarks. I informally conveyed displeasure with some of the prosecutor's attacks on Ford's counsel, and issued a general instruction, in the jury charge, that [w]hat the attorneys have said ... is not evidence. But see Dispoz O Plastics, 172 F.3d at 287 (finding that a general instruction to evaluate witnesses' credibility based on their testimony was not sufficient to neutralize the harm caused by a specific instance of prosecutorial vouching). Moreover, it is quite possible that one of my instructions may inadvertently have exacerbated the effect of the prosecutor's misconduct: after the prosecutor reminded the jury that McKinley got shot, I allowed 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 18 \f U.S. v. Ford, 618 F.Supp.2d 368 (2009) the prosecutor to continue his rebuttal over the defendant's objection and said that I think the jury will remember and decide what was said. It's up to the jury. Docket No. 81 at 65. Unfortunately, a juror may have reasonably construed this statement as permitting the jury to ignore my earlier instruction to disregard McKinley's testimony about being shot. My response to Ford's objection during the prosecutor's rebuttal may therefore have aggravated whatever degree of prejudice might have ensued from the prosecutor's statement had I remained silent. See United States v. Mastrangelo, 172 F.3d 288, 295 98 (3d Cir.1999) (reversing for prosecutorial misconduct where the district court's faulty curative instruction exacerbated the prejudice caused by a prosecutor's remark). Third, I must evaluate the effect of the prosecutor's remarks in light of the strength of the evidence against Ford. As addressed above, the government's evidence against Ford was far from overwhelming, and a reasonable juror could have concluded, from that evidence, that Ford was not the individual from whom McKinley purchased cocaine base on November 10, 2005. Unless a reasonable juror were to credit McKinley's testimony, he would be left without sufficient evidence from which to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Harold Ford, rather than one of the other individuals with whom McKinley negotiated drug purchases on November 10, sold cocaine base to McKinley that day. Ultimately, having balanced these factors in considering the effect of prosecutor's remarks during his rebuttal, I cannot say that I am left with a sure conviction that the error did not prejudice the defendant. Zehrbach, 47 F.3d at 1265. In a trial that was interlarded with gratuitous attacks by both parties, it would hardly be surprising that the prosecutor was tempted, at times, to engage in inappropriate conduct. Ford's defense, and particularly the closing argument of his counsel, challenged the integrity of both the prosecutor and the government's witnesses. These challenges merited a vigorous response. Unfortunately, however, the prosecutor went beyond any response that was warranted. The prosecutor's inappropriate comments bolstered the credibility of witnesses whose testimony, in light of the weakness of the government's evidence, was necessary to secure Ford's conviction. Consequently, I must conclude that there is not a high probability that the prosecutorial misconduct in this case did not contribute to the jury's verdict. IV. Conclusion In this opinion I have described two courtroom aspects of this case that made *399 for a difficult trial. The first was the pervasive acrimony that colored the interactions between the lawyer representing the United States and the lawyer representing Harold Ford. The second closely related to the first was the prosecutor's drumbeat of derision, not simply for opposing counsel but for those lawyers, as a class, who are engaged in the representation of criminal defendants, to the point of suggesting that such lawyers engage in deliberate deception. This was, in my view, the worst of the prosecutor's offenses. The recitals, in his closing- argument-rebuttal, of statements he attributed to members of the criminal defense bar could only have been intended to convey the view that criminal defense attorneys have as their goals confus [ing] the issue[s] and preventing the government from making sense. This belittling of the criminal defense process extended also to the prosecutor's characterization of the defense of misidentification as a defense of last resort. 35 By anecdote and innuendo, criminal defense lawyers were portrayed for the jury as persons whose expected and habitual professional role is to mislead the jury by distorting, or hiding, the truth through a criminal defense process that encourages such deception. For counsel for the United States to show such disrespect and, indeed, disdain for crucial ingredients of constitutional processes developed over centuries was inexcusable. A reader of this transcript could well say that a prosecutor behaving in this fashion should have been called to account, early and often, by the judge. Such criticism would be appropriate. In reading over the transcript I found myself, at many points, troubled that I had not stepped in and directed the prosecutor to cease behaving in a fashion signally inappropriate for a government's lawyer. Too often I was too mild in reproof or simply directed the prosecutor to move on. One could, therefore, argue that it is not merely unbecoming, but far too late in the day, for the judge to determine that the prosecutor committed misconduct. But that begs the issue. The question is whether the prosecutor's unhappy behavior may have caused substantial damage to the integrity of the trial, thus prejudicing the defendant. With this in mind, one recognizes that the judge's unduly tepid response to the prosecutor's behavior was not likely to have done much 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 19 \f U.S. v. Ford, 618 F.Supp.2d 368 (2009) to insure that the defendant was accorded the fair process that was his due. Accordingly, because I believe that there is a significant possibility that the fairness of the jury's verdict may have been threatened by the prosecutorial vouching and attacks on the defendant's counsel, I will exercise my discretion to set aside the jury's verdict on count one of the indictment and grant Ford a new trial. Footnotes 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 In moving for acquittal due to prosecutorial misconduct, Ford mistakes his remedy. A finding of prosecutorial misconduct would call for setting aside the verdict with a view to retrial (Rule 33(a)), not entering a judgment of acquittal. Specifically, the grand jury charged that (1) [o]n or about November 10, 2005, Ford knowingly and intentionally distributed approximately 5 grams or more ... of a mixture and substance containing a detectable amount of cocaine base ( crack ), and (2) [o]n or about November 17, 2005, Ford knowingly and intentionally distributed approximately 5 grams or more ... of a mixture and substance containing a detectable amount of cocaine base ( crack ). Docket No. 10. McKinley testified that, in June 1997, he pled guilty to distributing crack cocaine [o]n a number of occasions. Docket No. 80 (Transcript of Trial, January 25, 2008) at 60. Sergeant Farley testified that, while he could hear McKinley's part of these telephone conversations, and the recordings included each speaker in a telephone conversation, Sergeant Farley could not himself hear the party speaking at the other end of the line. Docket No. 79 at 42. The transcript that the government had originally drafted reported Speaker 2 as saying I need that I need that A Stem. Docket No. 78 (Transcript of Trial, January 23, 2008) at 32. Prior to trial, the government edited the transcript to read: I need that I need that H Town. McKinley testified at trial that H Town is slang for half an ounce of crack cocaine, Docket No. 80 at 24, and that a pipe used to smoke crack cocaine is referred to as a stem. Docket No. 80 at 35. At a pretrial hearing, I directed the government to revise the transcript to be presented to the jury to include both possible interpretations of the recording. Docket No. 78 at 49 50. Sergeant Farley's testimony was based on his contemporaneous notes of what was being reported to him by other members of the task force. Though he did not personally observe McKinley during the transaction, Sergeant Farley testified that, while the operation was taking place, he took approximately four pages of notes of what other members of the task force were reporting to him. Docket No. 79 at 71 72. Sergeant Farley also testified that, after the transaction, took place, he met with McKinley, dictated McKinley's account of the transaction, and had McKinley read and correct any inaccuracies in the transcribed account. Docket No. 79 at 48 49. This testimony is consistent with the signed statement that McKinley gave to Sergeant Farley, at approximately 1:30 pm on the day in question: We talked about the purchase of one-half ounce of crack. [Ford] then told me that he had to go to Merchant Street to get the half ounce. Docket No. 79 at 94 95. Corporal McEvoy, who was conducting surveillance of McKinley, testified that he could not recall whether or not McKinley went inside the Midway Diner at any time. Docket No. 80 at 125. In her closing argument, Ford's counsel said that the alleged transaction between Ford and McKinley was at least a block and a half to two blocks from where [McEvoy] was situated. Docket No. 81 (Transcript of Trial, January 28, 2008) at 52. The government charges Ford's counsel with misstating Corporal McEvoy's testimony, and claims that Corporal McEvoy testified that he was less than four feet from the two men when they shook hands and, according to the government, engaged in the drug transaction. Docket No. 89 at 9 (citing Docket No. 80 at 102). The government's characterization of Corporal McEvoy's testimony is incorrect. Corporal McEvoy testified that he began observing McKinley from a position approximately two blocks east of th[e] bar where McKinley met Ford, and that he moved his vehicle so that he was eventually observing McKinley from approximately a block and a half from the bar. Docket No. 80 at 98 100. Corporal McEvoy testified that he saw Ford meet McKinley in front of the bar and then leave for a few minutes. Corporal McEvoy then testified that, when he again saw Ford and McKinley together in front of the bar, they were approximately four feet or less from each other. Docket No. 80 at 102. 10 Corporal McEvoy testified that he took no notes of his observations on November 10 and, concomitantly, that he had no contemporaneous record of witnessing a handshake between Ford and McKinley. Sergeant Farley testified that neither his contemporaneous notes of what was being reported to him by the task force members, nor his later reports, based 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 20 \f U.S. v. Ford, 618 F.Supp.2d 368 (2009) on discussions with his fellow officers, indicated that any of the task force members witnessed an exchange between Ford and McKinley on November 10. Docket No. 79 at 73 74. The transcript presented to the jury, which omits the speakers' identities, reads as follows ( - denotes a break in the sentence and, at times, a change in the speaker): 11 -I will be right with you ... -Hey, what's up, you want to go over there ... hit me man. (Speakers walking unintelligible conversation) -That's what I am telling you like -He's nuts ... it's a rap. -What's this? -Oh man you own the highway, you own the highway.

N 28. 12 As I will address in more detail below, the Sentencing Guidelines define crack cocaine as a form of cocaine base, usually prepared by processing cocaine hydrochloride and sodium bicarbonate, and usually appearing in a lumpy, rocklike form. U.S.S.G. 2D 1.1(d). 13 While McKinley testified at one point that he had not entered the restaurant, he did so tentatively. On direct examination, McKinley testified: Q. And did you go into the Midway at any time during your A. I don't remember. I might have. I might have stepped in there. I might have stepped out. Q. Did you leave the general area? A. No. Q. Okay, so you were either in front of or went into the Midway maybe? A. I was directly in front of it. I didn't go nowhere. Q. Okay. Do you recall if you went in or not or you're not sure? A. I didn't go in. Docket No. 79 at 159 60. During cross-examination, McKinley went on to testify as follows: Q. Now did you tell us yesterday that you never went into the Midway Diner on November the 10th? A. I wasn't two years ago I wasn't sure of every movement. I don't know if I briefly stopped in there or if I stayed outside. But, I'm most likely positive I was outside the whole time. Q. Okay. So, you're most likely positive that you were outside the whole time. So that, if Sgt. Farley testified that you went inside, he would be mistaken? A. Probably so. It was two years ago to him too. He's probably not sure of every movement too. 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 21 \f U.S. v. Ford, 618 F.Supp.2d 368 (2009) Docket No. 80 at 30 31. 14 15 16 The Third Circuit has explained the distinction between crack and freebase, another form of cocaine base, as follows: Cocaine is a naturally occurring substance that is derived from the leaves of the erythroxylon plant. United States Sentencing Commission, Special Report to the Congress: Cocaine and Federal Sentencing Policy, at vi (1995) [hereinafter Special Report ]. There are five basic forms of the drug: coca leaves, coca paste, powder cocaine, freebase cocaine, and crack cocaine. Id. at 11. There are three base forms of cocaine: coca paste, freebase cocaine, and crack cocaine. Id. Coca paste, not usually imported into the United States, is a chunky, off-white to light-brown, putty-like substance that exists primarily as an intermediate product in the processing of coca leaves into powder cocaine. Id. Both freebase cocaine and crack cocaine are forms of cocaine base produced from powder cocaine. Id. at 13. In this form, the powder cocaine has been freed from the salt substrate and is once again in a base form similar to that of coca paste. Id. To create freebase cocaine, powder cocaine is dissolved in water and a strong alkaloid solution, typically ammonia is added, along with another organic solvent like ether. Id. The use of this process was first documented in the 1970s, but many resisted the freebasing process because of its complexity and potential danger. Ether, a highly volatile and flammable solvent, will ignite or explode if the freebase cocaine is smoked before the ether has evaporated entirely. Id. Cocaine base prepared using the freebase method was replaced by the crack method. See, e.g., United States v. Johnson, 976 F.Supp. 284, 290 (D.Del.1997) ( [F]reebase cocaine ... seems to have outlived its utility with the emergence of crack cocaine. ) To produce crack cocaine, the powder cocaine is dissolved in a solution of sodium bicarbonate and water, which is then cooked, leaving a solid substance called crack cocaine. Special Report at 14. The crack cocaine is broken or cut into rocks, each typically weighing from one-tenth to one-half a gram. Id. This method is considered to be the most common method of producing cocaine base. See United States v. Barbosa, 271 F.3d 438, 462 (3d Cir.2001). Crack is not a chemical term; it describes a substance that results from a general method for making cocaine base out of powder cocaine. See United States v. Waters, 313 F.3d 151, 156 (3d Cir.2002). The Sentencing Guidelines note, [c]rack is the street name for a form of cocaine base, usually prepared by processing cocaine hydrochloride and sodium bicarbonate, and usually appearing in a lumpy rocklike form. U.S.S.G. 2D1.1(c), Note D. See also Waters, 313 F.3d at 156. United States v. Brigman, 350 F.3d 310, 312 13 (3d Cir.2003) (determining that, for purposes of calculating defendant's sentence under the then-mandatory sentencing guidelines, government had proved by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant distributed crack cocaine), abrogated by United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). See supra note 3. My cautionary remark was prompted by an objection by Ford's counsel, in an exchange that proceeded as follows: Mr. MCGETTIGAN: ... Scrutinize [McKinley's] testimony and consider it, but give him the respect that is due to a person who at some apprehension and risk to himself cooperated in [sic] the Government with the Government in addressing the serious problem of drug sales and at risk MS. LEFEBER: Objection, Your Honor. THE COURT: Overruled. MR. MCGETTIGAN: And notwithstanding that this has not made him a popular person in the community of Coatesville and at the risk of persons who would have him not testify who would intimidate him MS. LEFEBER: Objection, Your Honor. MR. MCGETTIGAN: to come in here and testify MS. LEFEBER: Objection. THE COURT: I think that's a little much, Mr. McGettigan. MR. MCGETTIGAN: I'll move on, Your Honor. THE COURT: Yeah, let's leave that alone. All right? Docket No. 79 at 24 25. 17 The government accuses Ford's counsel of fabricating aspects of McKinley's criminal history during this argument. While Ford's counsel was permitted to cross-examine McKinley about his convictions for drug distribution and shooting into the window of an occupied vehicle, counsel's opening argument did allude to aspects of McKinley's criminal history that she 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 22 \f U.S. v. Ford, 618 F.Supp.2d 368 (2009) 18 was ultimately barred from inquiring into at trial. However, she had a good-faith basis for making these allusions. At one of several pretrial conferences held the week before trial for the purpose of addressing discovery disputes, the prosecutor confirmed that the government had not produced evidence of Kevin McKinley's criminal history, despite the defendant having requested the material in discovery motions filed several months before trial, pursuant to Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150, 92 S.Ct. 763, 31 L.Ed.2d 104 (1972). Docket No. 76 (Transcript of Pretrial Conference, January 17, 2008) at 10 13. (Ford's counsel represented, at these conferences, that the government had also failed to produce other evidence to which the defendant was entitled, including audible copies of the recordings that constituted the prosecution's primary evidence against Ford.) I directed the government to authorize the Chester County probation department to produce a copy of McKinley's most recent presentence investigation ( PSI ) report, which the government theretofore had not done. At a subsequent pretrial conference, after Ford received a copy of McKinley's PSI report, I granted Ford's counsel permission to cross-examine Mr. McKinley, at trial, as to each of the arrests reported in the PSI report. Docket No. 78 at 11 12. My subsequent evidentiary rulings at trial in part limiting Ford's counsel's cross-examination of McKinley with regard to his prior convictions were not entirely consistent with this earlier determination. The full exchange is as follows: MS. LEFEBER: The entire case depends on Mr. McKinley's word. The evidence will show that he's led a lifetime of crime, and his word can't be believed. Robberies, stabbings, drugs, drugs, drugs, and more drugs. That was how he supported himself, and every all the time that he was wheeling and dealing drugs on the streets of Coatesville in front of the Midway Diner and VFW bar, he was carrying a gun, sticking up people, and terrorizing people with that gun. MR. MCGETTIGAN: Your Honor MS. LEFEBER: But things change. MR. MCGETTIGAN: You're Honor, excuse me. Your Honor, I'm going to object. Counsel is THE COURT: All right. MR. MCGETTIGAN: making something up here. THE COURT: I don't think we need to pursue that. MS. LEFEBER: Could we ask Mr. McGettigan not to make statements like counsel is making something up. I think that's inappropriate. THE COURT: I don't think I think Mr. McGettigan doesn't need to say that, and I don't think we need to talk about terrifying MS. LEFEBER: Things THE COURT: the population. Docket No. 79 at 31 32. 19 This exchange proceeded as follows: [BY MR. MCGETTIGAN] Q. Okay. And eventually as a result of those phone calls, did you make a phone call and contact the defendant, Harold Ford? [MCKINLEY] A. Yes. MS. LEFEBER: Objection, Your Honor. Can we like not lead the witness? MR. MCGETTIGAN: Your Honor, that's not a leading question. MS. LEFEBER: Just ask him who you called and MR. MCGETTIGAN: Your Honor, with all due respect MS. LEFEBER: not spoon feed him? MR. MCGETTIGAN: Counsel doesn't understand what['s] leading that's not MS. LEFEBER: Objection. MR. MCGETTIGAN: a leading question. MS. LEFEBER: You know, these kind of remarks in front of the jury are inappropriate. THE COURT: That was a little more leading, Mr. McGettigan, than is necessary. Docket No. 79 at 163 64. The exchange proceed as follows: 20 [BY MS. LEFEBER]: Q. Now did you tell us yesterday that you never went into the Midway Diner on November the 10th? A. I wasn't sure. 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 23 \f U.S. v. Ford, 618 F.Supp.2d 368 (2009) Q. You weren't sure? A. [MCKINLEY]: I wasn't two years ago I wasn't sure of every movement. I don't know if I briefly stopped in there or if I stayed outside. But, I'm most likely positive I was outside the whole time. Q. Okay. So, you're most likely positive that you were outside the whole time. So that, if Sgt. Farley testified that you went inside, he would be mistaken? A. Probably so. It was two years ago to him too. He's probably not sure of every movement too. Q. Oh, okay. Now you say after you met Harold Ford either inside our outside of the Midway Diner on November the 10th, MR. MCGETTIGAN: Excuse me. BY MS. LEFEBER: Q. that he MR. MCGETTIGAN: Objection. That misstates his testimony. He never said he met Mr. Ford inside the Midway Diner BY MS LEFEBER: Q. Well, MR. MCGETTIGAN: ever BY MS LEFEBER: Q. you met him, right, either inside or outside. You can't remember, right? MR. MCGETTIGAN: Excuse me. Objection. That misstates his testimony as well. He doesn't say can't [sic] remember where he met Mr. Ford. And, counsel is intentionally misstating the testimony. MS LEFEBER: Your Honor, that's rude. THE COURT: Mr. McGettigan, I think I think it's unnecessary to characterize counsel as having intentionally done anything. MR. MCGETTIGAN: I beg your pardon, Your Honor. THE COURT: If you have an objection to make, you can make the objection. But, the editorializing is unnecessary. Docket No. 80 at 30 32. 21 See Pitner v. Murrin, Civil No. 07 355 (E.D. Pa. filed January 29, 2007). In Pitner, the plaintiffs alleged that Corporal McEvoy and other officers engaged in a search that was undertaken pursuant to a warrant, but which was nonetheless unlawful. Pitner v. Murrin, Civil No. 07 355 (E.D. Pa. filed January 29, 2007). Specifically, plaintiffs alleged that, to obtain the search warrant, the officers filed an affidavit stating that one of the plaintiffs, driving a Ford Bronco, picked up a street- level drug dealer, who had informed an undercover agent that he was waiting to get marijuana from his supplier, and that the street-level dealer soon returned with marijuana on hand. See id., Second Am. Compl. 18. Plaintiffs further alleged that, prior to executing their search, the officers had no information that plaintiffs were involved in any criminal activity. Id. 36. After Ford's trial, the court awarded summary judgment to defendants and, in so doing, found that Corporal McEvoy did not swear to the facts alleged in the affidavit, and did not participate in drafting the affidavit. See Pitner v. Murrin, Civil No. 07 355, 2008 WL 2552807, at *1 (E.D.Pa. June 25, 2008). 22 While it may be the case that the cross-examination of Corporal McEvoy should have been curtailed given the minimal probative value of the inquiry, Ford's counsel was not, in fact, lying. In their second amended complaint, in Pitner v. Murrin, described in footnote 21, supra, plaintiffs alleged that, although McEvoy did not sign the affidavit used to obtain the search warrant, he was one of the affiants. Second Amended Complaint 16, Pitner, No. 07 355. The prosecutor presented this fictional dialogue as follows: 23 And I'll tell you, in thinking about a case, even relatively brief cases, sometimes lawyers will discuss with their colleagues, and I think, what's the expression, you look for a devil's advocate, and you talk about your case a little bit. And, now, you can do that in this case. One of the things you can say is gee, you know, I would have liked to have had an officer who was placing recorders and transmitters, who was really familiar with Coatesville, who wasn't a University of Pennsylvania officer. And then my colleague would say, well, isn't Coatesville a small town with maybe just one or two police officers devoted to narcotics? So you'd have to have a task force, you have to have others. Okay. Fine. But then I said, well, gee, I'd really like to have a witness buy a half an ounce and an ounce of drugs, who didn't have a lengthy criminal history involving drugs and contact with criminals and stuff like that. And my colleague would say, well, gee, a nun, a priest, a person with no criminal history might have a tough time buying an ounce or two, or an ounce, or a half ounce of crack cocaine in Coatesville. 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 24 \f U.S. v. Ford, 618 F.Supp.2d 368 (2009) So I had to admit, there is some sense in that. So then you say, geez, you think I could have recorded tapes that didn't have a lot of background noise, and that you can hear audibly and just more of them. And my colleague would say, well, it's probably not reasonable to shut down traffic on Main Street in Coatesville and putting [sic] a big, visible microphone on your cooperator. It really might not be conducive to being able to buy drugs. So I said, well, gee, you know, I'd really like to have an agent who could drive to an unfamiliar place, use a two-way radio, follow people while they're walking, not be seen and take notes, all at the same time. And my colleague said, well when they get an agent with three arms, you'll probably get that. I said, hum, I'd like someone to be real close to these transactions. They said, that's pretty hard to do in an urban area where the police might be known. And, finally, I said, gee, you know, can I have a police officer who hasn't been sued? And my colleague said, well, weren't you, the defense attorney and the Judge in your last drug case all sued? And I had to admit, he had a point. You can sue anyone you want. Docket No. 81 (Transcript of Trial, January 28, 2008) at 10 12. Then, while addressing the reliability of Kevin McKinley's testimony, the prosecutor continued: And that's one other thing I asked my colleague. I said, you know, you'd think I could have a witness who would speak up, who would really stand get next to that microphone and talk to the Court. And my colleague said, well, those are the actors, not real people. Docket No. 81 at 14. The prosecutor said, in full: 24 So, I'm going to give you a little background, just in the way to look at this case. With the principles that apply to criminal cases generally. It's kind of an interesting thing. Something that was pointed to me years ago. The arguments against the non-occurrence of a criminal act are limited to three. Three things. (a) It didn't happen. That's number one well, one. It didn't happen. There was no crime. No crime, in fact, occurred. Okay? For instance, the person you thought was dead, they turn up. The money you thought was stolen was just misplaced. So no crime occurred. The act itself didn't occur. Okay. Two, the act occurred, but there's an excuse, or a justification. Well I didn't hit first, it was self-defense. Or for instance, I'll tell you what, but for my role here today in this courtroom, this [ the prosecutor took the package of cocaine base that was marked as a government exhibit and placed the package under his suit jacket ] would be a criminal offense. But I have an excuse. This is my job. So, that's two of the explanations of why a crime hasn't occurred. Well, and then there's the third. And that's how we arrive here. The third is, well it happened, the crime happened. There's no excuse, no justification. But it wasn't me. So what you'll hear what you understand here is a defense of an argument, excuse me, of last resort, well because and I think counsel, and correct me if I'm wrong, it's your recollection that controls, counsel, in her opening said, well, there were drugs purchased that day, no question about that. And as far as I know, there's no excuse or justification present. These aren't prescription drugs. So, by a last resort, we arrive at, it wasn't me. Docket No. 81 at 15 16. Ford's counsel said, in full: 25 The truth in this case is that this Government wants to keep the truth from you. They wanted to keep the truth from you. They don't want you to know the real facts and the real truth. Do you remember when Corporal McEvoy was on the stand? The first question out of the box I asked him was, you arrested Mr. Ford, didn't you? Yeah. Did he have any drugs on him? Did he have any drug paraphernalia? Did he have large sums of money? Did he have anything on him at all? I don't remember. And before I asked McEvoy that, I asked the Government for a stipulation, can you stipulate that when you arrested my client, nothing on him but $37? Oh, no, we can't, we can't agree to that. So I ask the witnesses. Okay? McEvoy, at first he didn't recall, but then I think he did. And, of course, it's your recollection. And the truth is, the truth came out through Agent Wood. Thirty-seven dollars on him when they arrested him. No drugs. No drugs found in his home. No guns, no scales, nothing. Why didn't the Government want you to know that? Why did they try so hard to keep that from you? 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 25 \f U.S. v. Ford, 618 F.Supp.2d 368 (2009) Docket No. 81 at 31 32. 26 Ford's counsel argued (with some inaccuracy as to McKinley's testimony about whether he went inside the Midway Diner): I have to get up on cross-examination and ask them to play the tapes of Kevin McKinley's drug dealing, minutes before he meets Harold Ford at the Midway, with Martinez. And if you recall the Government, oh, we don't have those tapes, we can't play those. Oh, and we didn't bring them along. They brought them, and we eventually got them to play them for you. Remember that call at, I believe it was 11:49am on November the 10th, to Martinez? You heard it loud and clear. Half ounce of crack cocaine. Kevin McKinley wanted to get [crack] from Mr. Martinez, who I think there's testimony that they arrested him at some point, but they didn't see him that day. Half an ounce, loud and clear. In 40 minutes. It was 11:49 on November the 10th. Forty minutes later, Officer Farley told you, is just about when Kevin McKinley gets to the Midway. And goes inside the Midway. Officer Farley Sergeant Farley told you he went into the Midway. There's no officers in the Midway. The Government didn't play that tape for you, I had to play that tape for you. How about the next conversation? Minutes later, minutes before this supposed deal went down between Kevin McKinley and Harold Ford, another conversation, there's some unknown drug dealer. Well, you can't arrest an unknown can you? ... In those conversations, see, people, McKinley and the unknown and Martinez, they actually engaged in drug transactions. They discussed them. You heard them on the tapes. The Government didn't play that for you, they want to keep the truth from you, ladies and gentlemen. Docket No 81 at 32 34. Specifically, Ford's counsel said: 27 Do you recall how he recalled, with the greatest of precision imaginable, that on that day we left an undisclosed location and we turned southbound on 7th Street and northbound on Merchant and eastbound on Lincoln, and so and so, and at such a time I parked at the so and so and got McKinley and Ford were five to seven feet, this far apart, and I was located a block and a half away. A block being at least the size of this courtroom. And I saw this and I saw that. And I witnessed a handshake. And he remembered all of that with the greatest precision, he was very impressive at that time. Until cross-examination. And the first question out of the box was, do you recall when Mr. Ford was arrested? Did he have any drugs on him? Oh, I don't recall. You don't recall? What do you have, selective memory? You recall somebody walking eastbound on Merchant, or westbound on Lincoln Highway, and you don't recall whether the person who is the target of this whole thing who we're trying to prosecute here, you don't recall when you arrested him whether he had drugs on him? Come on. Do you have your own agenda? Maybe he's getting points for convicting people, because after all remember he told you, I was trying to show that he's a busy officer. Remember? Did you work five days a week? Oh, no I worked six days a week. Okay. And I think he was one of two narcotics officers in Coatesville. So he must have been very busy, I would assume. And this did happen two years ago. So when he realized where I was going, all of a sudden he told me he didn't witness it. Some weeks he didn't even witness a crime. Can you believe could you believe that? Do you really believe that, that he didn't witness any crimes? Docket No. 81 at 50 51. 28 The prosecutor said: I'd submit that you can infer that Mr. Ford was not locked up for a year, because it was an ongoing investigation. Kevin McKinley cooperated and made other buys. And if you lock someone up on the first day, the person who's the cooperator is useless for the rest of your activities. Instead, and I tried to follow this argument a little bit. And there were a lot of lawyer noises being made there, and I couldn't follow them all. And one of them said, why wasn't he locked up for a year? Because we didn't believe him. And I've been in this business for awhile. I want to hear that conversation, boss, we've been letting this sit out there for a year, we don't believe the guy, let's lock somebody up. Docket No. 81 at 64. 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 26 \f U.S. v. Ford, 618 F.Supp.2d 368 (2009) 29 30 31 32 33 These milder instances of vouching include the prosecutor's improper claim of authority I've been in this business for awhile that preceded an otherwise appropriate argument that the government would have little incentive to lock up Kevin McKinley. Docket No. 81 at 64 65. The prosecutor's vouching during rebuttal was also echoed in his appeal to facts outside the record in his initial closing argument when attempting to belittle the significance of Corporal McEvoy having been sued in connection with another investigation: And my colleague said, well, weren't you, the defense attorney and the Judge in your last drug case all sued? Docket No. 81 at 12. These remarks are particularly salient, as they immediately preceded the remarks in question and made clear that the prosecutor was invoking the government's good name as such, rather than offering a reasonable inference from the record about the government's integrity in this case. See Docket No. 81 at 57 58 ( Now, I'm the Government lawyer. I'm not getting rich. If a trial goes a week, I got to wear the same suit twice.... But when counsel says, the Government wants to keep the truth from you, well, as a lawyer, you don't have a whole lot, sometimes, but your good name and when you're accused personally-[.] ). In addressing Ford's claim that these statements constitute vouching, the government focuses on the prosecutor's statement that Corporal McEvoy was an honorable police officer doing honorable work. I agree that this statement, if it had stood alone, would have been an appropriate response to the defense's allegation that Corporal McEvoy had falsely testified to witnessing a handshake between Ford and Corporal McEvoy. See United States v. Weatherly, 525 F.3d 265, 271 72 (3d Cir.2008) (holding that, where the defense counsel accused testifying officers of perjury, the prosecutor could ask [w]hy would [the officers] risk their 32 34 years of experience on the police force over this case where the question called for an inference based upon evidence in the record ). But, in the case at bar, the prosecutor's gratuitous comments appear to accord McEvoy's testimony the imprimatur of government endorsement. The government does not appear to argue that the government's remarks were justified by the invited response doctrine. However, even if the government's brief could be construed to make this claim, I would not find the prosecutor's remarks so justified. Ford's challenge to the truthfulness of the government's witnesses and the forthrightness of the government's case was rooted in (1) the testimony of the government witnesses, (2) the existence of potentially exculpatory recordings of Kevin McKinley's conversations on November 10, and (3) the government's resistance to having those recordings played for the jury. The defense's argument was thus grounded in the evidence and was not articulated in markedly personal terms. See United States v. Weatherly, 525 F.3d 265, 272 (3d Cir.2008) ( It is permissible for counsel to argue inferences, but an inference must flow logically and convincingly from the facts in the record. ); see also Dispoz O Plastics, 172 F.3d at 285 ( We have generally found the invited response doctrine to be applicable only in instances where the prosecution team was attacked for reasons unsupported by the evidence at trial. ). As I instructed at the beginning of the government's rebuttal, the government was certainly entitled to address the defense's challenge to its candor, but it was not permitted to cast that argument in excessively personal terms. Reviewing the prosecutor's remarks in light of the trial record and based on my observations of the case, I find that the prosecutor's vouching was far in excess of any attack that was justified by the conduct of Ford's counsel. See United States v. Wood, 486 F.3d 781, 788 (3d Cir.2007) ( The invited response doctrine protects comments made in reasonable response to improper attacks by defense counsel.... But though a prosecutor may use the doctrine defensively, he may not do so offensively. ) (internal quotation marks omitted). I further note that the defense's closing argument, while aggressive in its attacks on the government, was a not-unwarranted response to the prosecutor's closing-argument characterizing the defense's trial strategy as one of last resort. The government argues that it was justified in accusing Ford's counsel of making something up, Docket No. 79 at 32, because she characterized McKinley as having led a lifetime of crime, including [r]obberies, stabbings, drugs, drugs, drugs, and more drugs, and carrying a gun, sticking up people, and terrorizing people with that gun. Docket No. 79 at 31 32. According to the government, this characterization of McKinley's criminal history bore no basis in fact (except for the drug trafficking, which was brought out by the government in it's [sic] opening statement.) Docket No. 89 at 29. However, while Ford's characterization of McKinley's criminal history was hyperbolic, and thus invited some response from the prosecutor, the statements were moored in fact. As addressed above, McKinley's lengthy criminal history included, in addition to numerous other firearm charges, a 2002 charge for making terroristic threats and 2003 convictions, pursuant to a guilty plea, for reckless endangerment and carrying an illegal firearm. The 2003 convictions were based on McKinley shooting into the window of an occupied vehicle. Docket No. 80 at 62 63. While the references by Ford's counsel to robberies, stabbings, and sticking up people were based on information that was ultimately 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 27 \f U.S. v. Ford, 618 F.Supp.2d 368 (2009) excluded from evidence, the information was not made up, but was drawn from a presentence investigation report of McKinley that defense counsel had received from the government just days before the trial. Thus, the prosecutor's allegation was one that was unsupported by the record evidence, Rivas, 493 F.3d at 139, and was an inappropriate response to Ford's opening argument. See United States v. Pelullo, 964 F.2d 193, 218 (3d Cir.1992) (stating that attorneys may not accuse each other of misconduct, such as subornation of perjury, unless there is a foundation in the record to support such charges ); see also Dispoz OPlastics, 172 F.3d at 285 ( We have generally found the invited response doctrine to be applicable only in instances where the prosecution team was attacked for reasons unsupported by the evidence at trial. ). Ford raises other claims which, if they were to be addressed, would be subject to plain error review. For example, Ford contends that the prosecutor improperly shifted the burden of proof to the defendant by categorizing Ford's arguments, under what the prosecutor characterized as principles that apply to criminal law generally, as a defense of ... last resort. Docket No. 81 at 15 16; see United States v. Balter, 91 F.3d 427, 441 (3d Cir.1996). ( [T]he prosecution ... may not improperly suggest that the defendant has the burden to produce evidence. ). Because I find that the jury's verdict must be set aside on other grounds, I will not reach these claims. Such an argument was not only inappropriate, it was false as a representation of the value of asserting a defense of misidentification. That innocent people are convicted of crimes they did not commit is not a new or a controversial proposition. See, e.g., Edwin Borchard, Convicting the Innocent: Sixty Five Actual Errors of Criminal Justice (1932) (detailing sixty-five cases of wrongful convictions); Hugo Adam Bedau and Michael L. Radelet, Miscarriages of Justice in Potentially Capital Cases, 40 Stan. L.Rev. 21 (1987) (analyzing 350 cases from the 20th century in which defendants convicted of capital or potentially capital crimes were later been found to be innocent); The Innocence Project, www. innocenceproject.org (last visited April 20, 2009) (detailing activities of organization, founded in 1992, whose efforts have led to the exoneration of 235 people nationwide who had been wrongfully convicted). 34 35 End of Document 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Holdings: The District Court, Pollak, J., held that: [1] substantial evidence supported jury's determination that defendant was the person from whom informant purchased cocaine base; [2] evidence submitted to jury that defendant distributed cocaine base to informant was consistent with charge; [3] prosecutor improperly vouched for government witnesses; [4] prosecutor's remarks improperly disparaged defense counsel; [5] prosecutor improperly bolstered informant's credibility through evidence outside record; and [6] prosecutor's misconduct was not harmless. Motion granted. West Headnotes (15) [1] Criminal Law evidence supported Substantial jury's determination that defendant, and not some other individual, was the person with whom informant arranged to purchase cocaine base outside restaurant, so as to support defendant's conviction for distributing five or more grams of cocaine base; despite the lack of recordings or contemporaneous documentation, informant testified that defendant gave him a half-ounce of cocaine base in exchange for $400, and telephone conversation that day between informant and defendant showed that defendant agreed to sell cocaine base to informant at restaurant.

Griffin, Law Office of John J. Griffin, Hope C. Lefeber, Philadelphia, PA, for Harold Ford. OPINION POLLAK, District Judge. Before the court is defendant Harold Ford's motion to set aside the verdict on count one of the government's two-count indictment. A jury found Ford guilty of distributing five or more grams of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(b), on November 10, 2005 (Count 1 of the indictment), but acquitted him of count two, distributing five or more grams of cocaine base in a separate incident on November 17, 2005 (Count 2). Ford moves for a judgment of acquittal on count one, pursuant to Rule 29(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, contending that there was not sufficient evidence to support the jury's guilty verdict. Alternatively, in his Rule 29 motion, Ford seeks acquittal on Count 1 on grounds of prosecutorial misconduct. 1 I. Background In November 2005, a Drug Enforcement Administration ( DEA ) task force composed of DEA agents and local police *372 officers was investigating drug trafficking activities in Coatesville, Pennsylvania. Eleven months later, in October 2006, members of the task force arrested Harold Ford; in November 2006, a grand jury returned a two-count indictment. 2 The charges were based on drugs allegedly distributed to a confidential informant, Kevin McKinley. II. Sufficiency of the Evidence Ford argues that the evidence presented to the jury was insufficient to prove, as the indictment charged, that he distributed cocaine base ( crack ) on November 10, 2005. In addressing this claim, the jury's verdict must be upheld if there is substantial evidence from which a rational trier of fact could find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. United States v. Miller, 527 F.3d 54, 60 (3d Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks omitted). This inquiry requires that the court interpret the evidence in the light most favorable to the government as the verdict winner, and do[es] not weigh evidence or determine the credibility of witnesses in making [its] determination. Id. (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). A. The evidence relevant to the count-one distribution charge is as follows: In the fall of 2005, the DEA task force obtained the cooperation of a then-confidential source, Kevin McKinley, in staging undercover drug purchases. McKinley, a Coatesville resident with a lengthy criminal history, including a conviction for drug distribution, 3 had been arrested on September 5, 2005, and again on October 2015 Thomson Reuters.

One of McKinley's arresting officers on October 31, Corporal Chris McEvoy, a Coatesville narcotics officer working with the task force, solicited McKinley's cooperation with the task force's investigation. DEA Agent Brent Wood, who supervised the task force's investigation, testified that, in exchange for his cooperation, McKinley was promised that he would not face state or federal charges in connection with the September and October 2005 arrests. Docket No. 80 (Transcript of Trial, January 25, 2008) at 167. McKinley's cooperation began with an interview on November 7, 2005 about drug trafficking in Coatesville. The interview was conducted in part by Sergeant William Farley, an officer of the University of Pennsylvania Police Department ( UPPD ). Sergeant Farley began working for the UPPD in 2001, after having spent a year working with the park police in Delaware County. Docket No. 79 at 39. At the time that Sergeant Farley interviewed McKinley, in 2005, Farley was assigned to a DEA task force concurrently with his UPPD responsibilities. Docket No. 79 at 39. On November 10, 2005, based on information obtained during the November 7 interview, Sergeant Farley fitted McKinley with a recording device and listened as McKinley made several *373 calls to negotiate drug purchases. 4 Docket No. 79 at 39 42. One of these calls, which was played for the jury during Sergeant Farley's cross examination, was made to Joe Martinez, a local drug dealer, at 11:49 a.m. During this call, McKinley arranged to purchase a half-ounce of crack cocaine in about forty minutes. Docket No. 79 at 81 83. According to Sergeant Farley's testimony, McKinley's conversation with Martinez included discussion of both the quantity and the price of the drugs that were to be purchased. Docket No. 79 at 83, 89. McKinley also called another local drug dealer, Fredrick ( Freddie ) Williams, to arrange the purchase of crack cocaine. McKinley made a third call, at approximately 11:55 a.m. Docket No. 79 at 83 85. This conversation was played for the jury during Sergeant Farley's direct examination. The jury was given a transcript of the conversation that read as follows: SPEAKER 1: Hello SPEAKER 2: Yo where you at? SPEAKER 1: I am just pulling up I just got here they had me there all morning man. SPEAKER 2: Oh you just now ... how did you make out? REDACTED SPEAKER 2: I am ready to come down there, I need you man SPEAKER 1: What's up? SPEAKER 2: I need that I need that A-stem OR I need that I need that H-town 5 SPEAKER 1: Alright SPEAKER 2: Where you at? SPEAKER 1: I am down at the Midway ordering my grill right now. SPEAKER 2: Alright is my sister down there ... hugh SPEAKER 1: She ain't here SPEAKER 2: Alright I will be down SPEAKER 1: Alright Gov't Exh. N 29. On direct examination, McKinley testified that he was the person identified as speaker 2, and Harold Ford was speaker 1. Docket No. 80 at 24. After these conversations, McKinley, outfitted with a concealed transmitter and recording device, and supplied with $400 in buy money, was dropped off in an alley near the Midway Diner, the restaurant referred to in the above conversation. Docket No. 79 at 46 47, 157. McKinley walked to the Midway Diner and arrived there at approximately 12:20 p.m., according to Sergeant Farley's testimony. 6 At *374 trial, McKinley testified that Ford was standing in front of the Midway when he arrived, and that he and Ford discussed 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 5 \f U.S. v. Ford, 618 F.Supp.2d 368 (2009) the purchase of half an ounce of crack cocaine. According to McKinley, Ford instructed McKinley to wait while he went to get the drugs; McKinley further testified that he remember[ed] [Ford] taking too long, and called him to see where he was. 7 Docket No. 79 at 158. However, Sergeant Farley, who had listened to all of McKinley's recorded conversations on November 10, testified on cross-examination that there was no record of a conversation between McKinley and Ford discussing the quantity or price of drugs. Docket No. 79 at 93, 95 96. Sergeant Farley also testified that he had no record of McKinley calling Ford on his cell phone while McKinley was waiting at the Midway Diner. Docket No. 79 at 96. Sergeant Farley further testified that McKinley could not turn off the transmitter or recording device that he was carrying, and that all conversations between McKinley and Ford should have been recorded. Docket No. 79 at 76. McKinley testified that he had not gone inside the Midway Diner before meeting Ford or while waiting for him to return. Docket No. 79 at 160. Sergeant Farley, however, testified that, according to his contemporaneous notes (see footnote 6, supra ), Kevin McKinley, on arriving at the Midway Diner, entered and remained inside for less than two minutes. 8 Docket No. 79 at 87 88. No members of the task force were conducting surveillance inside the Midway Diner. Docket No. 79 at 87 88. McKinley testified that, about five or ten minutes after he called Ford while waiting for him outside the Midway Diner, Ford returned. [Ford] came back walking down the street and came back to me in front of the Midway, and walked west [to] east on the Midway, like off to the side back towards the alley I came from. That's when he handed it to me. Docket No. 79 at 158. McKinley testified that he paid $400 to Ford and received half an ounce of crack cocaine, Docket No. 79 at 160 61, and that the transaction occurred through a handshake: He shakes my hand, give me the stuff, I shake his hand back, give him the money. Docket No. 79 at 161. Overall, according to McKinley's testimony, twenty or twenty-five minutes elapsed between initially meeting Ford outside the Midway Diner and the transaction taking place. Docket No. 79 at 159. Corporal McEvoy testified to having observed Ford and McKinley outside the Midway Diner. Driving in a vehicle different from Sergeant Farley's (six task force vehicles were involved in the operation, Docket No. 79 at 44 45), Corporal McEvoy staked out a position about a block and a half to two blocks east of the Midway Diner to conduct surveillance of McKinley. *375 9 Docket No. 80 at 98 100. Corporal McEvoy testified, on cross-examination, that this position was across a very busy intersection from the Midway Diner and that there were always a lot of people on the street at the location. Docket No. 80 at 126 27. According to Corporal McEvoy, he saw McKinley walk toward the Midway Diner and then meet and engage in a conversation with Ford. Docket No. 80 at 100. Corporal McEvoy said that he observed Ford walking north from the restaurant toward Merchant Street. Docket No. 80 at 100 01. Then, according to Corporal McEvoy, he lost sight of Ford for a number of minutes but saw Ford once more as he walked south and met McKinley again in front of the Midway Diner. Docket No. 80 at 101 02. Corporal McEvoy testified that Ford and McKinley then shook hands and separated after a few more seconds. However, Corporal McEvoy acknowledged that he did not actually observe drugs or money transferred during this handshake, but added that, in his experience, shaking hands is indicative of a drug transaction. 10 Docket No. 80 at 119. During Sergeant Farley's cross-examination, Ford's counsel played a recording of a 12:46 p.m. conversation between McKinley, who was then still in the vicinity of the Midway Diner, and a person the task force could not identify. Docket No. 79 at 89 91. The recording included discussion of prices 350, 370, 380 dollars and references to scales. Docket No. 79 at 91. McKinley testified that this conversation occurred while he was waiting for Ford to return, and that he and the speaker in the conversation were discussing prices for a half ounce of crack cocaine. McKinley further testified that he did not remember the name of the person with whom he had this conversation, but that the person was some young guy. Docket No. 80 at 18 20. A 12:48 p.m. conversation between McKinley and other speakers, one of whom McKinley identified as Ford, was played for the jury while McKinley was on the stand, and a transcript of the conversation (which Sergeant Farley testified to being accurate, (Docket No. 79 at 68 69)), *376 was 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 6 \f U.S. v. Ford, 618 F.Supp.2d 368 (2009) presented to the jury. 11 According to McKinley's testimony, the conversation began with his calling to Ford ( Forte, pronounced forty ) as he was walking from the highway: Oh man you own the highway, you own the highway. Forte I want ... you the big man down here, you worrying about comm' on comm' on man. Gov't Exh. N 28. Then, based on McKinley's identification of the speakers, Docket No. 80 at 21 22, 33, Ford explained to McKinley that he had no drugs on him because he was forced to hide nine ounces of cocaine: I don't got nothing, Ford said. Where you going to be at ... you had coke here, McKinley said. Ford replied, No the cops ... listen I was driving and they started following me, so I had to go and stash it McKinley responded, How much, how much did you stash? Nine ounces. Ford continued, I did ... I cooked it up.... I was scared ... I mean it wasn't outside or nowhere or nothing. Gov't Exh. N 28; Docket No. 80 at 21 22, 33. McKinley testified that this conversation occurred after Ford had brought him the half-ounce of crack cocaine. Docket No. 80 at 23. After the transaction at the Midway Diner had been completed, McKinley returned to the alley where he had been dropped off and got into the van with Sergeant Farley and a task force detective. Docket No. 79 at 161. McKinley gave agents what he testified to be crack cocaine. Docket No. 79 at 161. DEA Forensic Chemist Ken Fuentecilla later tested and weighed the substance and, at trial, testified that the substance was 12.7 grams of cocaine base. Docket No. 79 at 125. On cross-examination, Mr. Fuentecilla could not identify the substance as crack cocaine, and could not provide a definition of crack cocaine: Cocaine base crack, it's I guess the word crack is a street term. So ... none of my analysis are [sic] you know, scientifically, crack means nothing to me really. Docket No. 79 at 132 33. Mr. Fuentecilla was also *377 unable to offer a distinction between freebase cocaine and crack cocaine: Q. Cocaine base, freebase is not referred to on the street as crack, correct? A. I don't know street terms. Docket No. 79 at 133. On further cross-examination, after some pressing, Mr. Fuentecilla acknowledged that his report of the substance did not indicate the presence of hydrochloride or bicarbonates. 12 Docket No. 79 at 137. B. Ford makes two substantial-evidence claims. First, Ford argues that there is not substantial evidence showing that he rather than one of the other individuals from whom McKinley arranged to purchase drugs on November 10, 2005 distributed cocaine base to McKinley that day. Alternatively, Ford argues that there is insufficient evidence from which to conclude that the substance that McKinley purchased that day was crack, rather than another form of cocaine base. For the reasons that follow, I find these arguments unpersuasive. 1. [1] In order to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Ford distributed cocaine base on November 10, a factfinder must credit Kevin McKinley's testimony. McKinley testified that, on November 10, outside the Midway restaurant, Ford gave him a half-ounce of cocaine base in exchange for $400. However, despite the task force's extensive surveillance of McKinley's activities on November 10, there are no recordings or contemporaneous documentation corroborating McKinley's testimony that, via a quick handshake, he and Ford exchanged drugs for money. The nearest thing to corroboration is Corporal McEvoy's testimony that, from across a very busy intersection, he saw a handshake; but he did not see a transfer or drugs and money. Aside from McKinley's testimony that he purchased crack cocaine from Ford on November 10, the evidence that gives strongest support for the jury's verdict is the 11:55 a.m. telephone conversation that day between McKinley and Ford. Viewed in the light most favorable to the government, this call shows that Ford agreed to sell cocaine base to McKinley, and let McKinley know that he was at the Midway Diner. However, Ford and McKinley did not discuss when the transaction would actually occur and, minutes before this call was placed, McKinley called Joe Martinez, who specifically 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 7 \f U.S. v. Ford, 618 F.Supp.2d 368 (2009) agreed to sell drugs to McKinley within forty minutes of the call. McKinley arrived at the Midway diner approximately thirty minutes after this call to Martinez. Hence, if one were to disbelieve McKinley's testimony, but nonetheless credit the testimony of each of the other government witnesses, the evidence would not support a finding beyond a reasonable doubt that Ford, rather than Martinez or another individual, distributed cocaine base to McKinley outside the Midway restaurant on November 10. Moreover, in addition to McKinley's call to Martinez, other evidence casts doubt on whether McKinley testified accurately that Ford, rather than another person, distributed drugs to him outside the Midway restaurant. According to Sergeant Farley's contemporaneous notes, when McKinley arrived at the restaurant, he went inside, where he was completely free from surveillance, for approximately two minutes. *378 13 McKinley then met Ford outside the restaurant and, after a moment, Ford left. McKinley testified that, when Ford first arrived at the restaurant, they discussed the price and volume of the drug purchase. Sergeant Farley testified, however, that all conversations between McKinley and Ford should have been recorded, and that McKinley did not have the ability to turn off the recording instruments that were concealed on him. Likewise, although McKinley testified to calling Ford while waiting for him to return to the restaurant with the drugs, Sergeant Farley testified that there is no record of such a call having been made. There is, however, a recorded conversation between McKinley and a person whom McKinley did not identify at trial about the price of a half-ounce of crack cocaine. This conversation which, according to McKinley, occurred while he was still waiting for Ford to return with the drugs took place at 12:46 p.m. It is even more difficult to reconcile McKinley's testimony with what was next recorded. At 12:48 p.m., within two minutes of the drug negotiation between McKinley and the unidentified person, McKinley called out to Ford, who was walking from the highway ( Oh man you own the highway, you own the highway ). In this conversation, Ford explained to McKinley that he don't got nothing, and that he was forced to stash nine ounces of cocaine because he was being followed by police. While McKinley testified that the 12:46 pm drug negotiation occurred before he met Ford, he also testified that this 12:48 p.m. conversation wherein Ford explains that he did not have any drugs with him occurred after Ford dealt him a half-ounce of crack cocaine. The government offered no explanation for this discrepancy. [2] If, in light of this evidence, one were to discredit McKinley's testimony that Ford distributed the drugs that McKinley purchased on November 10, the weight of the evidence would not support the jury's verdict of guilty on Count 1 of the indictment. However, despite the jury's acquittal of Ford on Count 2, presumably manifesting jury rejection of McKinley's testimony with respect to the alleged November 17 distribution, I am precluded from assessing the credibility of McKinley's testimony that he purchased cocaine base from Ford on November 10. See Miller, 527 F.3d at 60. *379 The jury's apparent non-crediting of McKinley's testimony about events on November 17 does not destabilize the jury's manifest crediting of McKinley's testimony regarding November 10. The Third Circuit has cautioned that, in the context of a sufficiency-of-the-evidence review, [a] jury is free to believe part of a witness' testimony and disbelieve another part of it[.] United States v. Boone, 279 F.3d 163, 189 (3d Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks omitted). Therefore, I must credit McKinley's testimony as to the November 10 charge as true and, concomitantly, conclude that the weight of the evidence supports the jury's verdict. See United States v. Frampton, 382 F.3d 213, 222 (2d Cir.2004) ( [T]he testimony of a single, uncorroborated eyewitness is generally sufficient to support a conviction, and ... such a principle has deep roots in our system of justice. ) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, under the particularly deferential standard of review that governs sufficiency-of-the-evidence analysis, see United States v. Kellogg, 510 F.3d 188, 202 (3d Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks omitted), I conclude that there is substantial evidence supporting the jury's determination that Ford distributed cocaine base on November 10. 2. Ford also argues that, whether or not there is substantial evidence showing that he distributed cocaine base on November 10, there is insufficient evidence from which to conclude that he distributed a mixture and substance 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 8 \f U.S. v. Ford, 618 F.Supp.2d 368 (2009) containing a detectable amount of cocaine base ( crack ), in violation of 21 U.S.C. 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(b), as charged in count one of the indictment. Crack, as the term is defined in the Sentencing Guidelines, is the street name for a form of cocaine base, usually prepared by processing cocaine hydrochloride and sodium bicarbonate, and usually appearing in a lumpy rocklike form. 14 DEA Forensic Chemist Ken *380 Fuentecilla testified, on cross-examination, that while his tests of the substance distributed to McKinley on November 10 confirmed that it was cocaine base, the tests did not reveal the presence of bicarbonates. Moreover, while Sergeant Farley and McKinley referred to the substance in question as crack, they do not appear to have described the properties of the substance at a level of detail necessary to demonstrate that they were referring to the form of cocaine base generally accepted to be crack cocaine. Therefore, Ford argues, there is insufficient evidence that he distributed cocaine base ( crack ), as charged in count one of the indictment. [3] Ford's arguments are misplaced. The question whether Ford distributed crack, as opposed to another form of cocaine base, has no bearing on whether he may be found liable for violating 21 U.S.C. 841. There is disagreement among the circuit courts as to whether any substance other than crack fits within the definition 841 definition of cocaine base. The Third Circuit, however, hold[s] that, while the term cocaine base means only crack when a sentence is imposed under the Sentencing Guidelines, cocaine base encompasses all forms of cocaine base with the same chemical formula when the mandatory minimum sentences under 21 U.S.C. 841(b)(1) are implicated. United States v. Barbosa, 271 F.3d 438, 467 (3d Cir.2001). Here, the government has established that the substance distributed to McKinley on November 10 was cocaine base. Therefore, whether or not the cocaine base distributed on November 10 was crack, there was evidence submitted to the jury that was consistent with the charge that Ford distributed cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. 841(a) and (b)(1). base distributed could be thought to constitute a substantial variance between the indictment and the evidence adduced at trial. See United States v. McKee, 506 F.3d 225, 231 n. 7 (3d Cir.2007) ( [A]mendments [to an indictment] ... occur when the charging terms of the indictment are altered.... Variances occur when the charging terms are unchanged, but the evidence at trial proves facts materially different from those alleged in the indictment. If a variance between the indictment and the evidence does not alter the elements of the offense charged, we will focus upon whether or not there has been prejudice to the defendant. ) (quoting *381 United States v. Castro, 776 F.2d 1118, 1121 22 & n. 1 (3d Cir.1985)). Ford does not allege such a material variance, and I find none. C. In summary, I conclude that the government's evidence, if credited, would allow a reasonable juror to conclude, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Ford distributed five grams or more of cocaine base on November 10. Therefore, a judgment of acquittal will not be entered. III. Prosecutorial Misconduct [4] Having concluded that Ford is not entitled to a judgment of acquittal, I turn to whether the verdict must be set aside due to prosecutorial misconduct. Because Ford raised his misconduct claims post-trial, they are governed by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33, under which the district court has the discretion to vacate a judgment of conviction if the interest of justice so requires. This interest of justice determination requires me to consider the propriety of the government's conduct and its effect on the verdict based on an independent assessment of the evidence. See United States v. Johnson, 302 F.3d 139, 150 (3d Cir.2002) ( Unlike an insufficiency of the evidence claim, when a district court evaluates a Rule 33 motion it does not view the evidence favorably to the Government, but instead exercises its own judgment in assessing the Government's case. ). The fact that the grand jury alleged distribution of cocaine base ( crack ), and that the government did not establish that the substance distributed was crack, as distinct from some other form of cocaine base, would have the potential to affect the verdict only if the imprecision as to the form of cocaine A. [5] Ford argues that the prosecutor engaged in a pattern of misconduct that included vouching for the credibility of the government's witnesses and lodging unfounded attacks on Ford's counsel-a pattern which, Ford argues, began during 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 9 \f U.S. v. Ford, 618 F.Supp.2d 368 (2009) opening statements and culminated in the prosecutor's closing argument and, in particular, the closing-argument rebuttal. Analysis of these claims involves a two-stage inquiry. First, did the prosecutor's statements, considered in context, constitute misconduct? Second, if misconduct occurred, was it so severe that it may have had an adverse influence on the jury's objectivity in arriving at a verdict? See United States v. Young, 470 U.S. 1, 11, 105 S.Ct. 1038, 84 L.Ed.2d 1 (1985) ( [A] criminal conviction is not to be lightly overturned on the basis of a prosecutor's comments standing alone, for the statements or conduct must be viewed in context; only by doing so can it be determined whether the prosecutor's conduct affected the fairness of the trial. ). Ford preserved his misconduct claims through contemporaneous objections at trial, including repeated requests for a mistrial, and I will therefore review the claims in accordance with the harmless error principles set forth in United States v. Zehrbach, 47 F.3d 1252, 1265 (3d Cir.1995) (en banc) (holding that prosecutorial misconduct amounting to non-constitutional error is harmless when it is highly probable that the error did not contribute to the judgment ) (emphasis in original). See also United States v. Vitillo, 490 F.3d 314, 327 (3d Cir.2007) (reviewing vouching claims for harmless error when defendant objected to the alleged vouching at trial and by post-trial motion ). B. While Ford alleges that the prosecutor engaged in misconduct throughout the course of the trial, the focal point of my analysis will be the prosecutor's remarks during the government's closing-argument rebuttal. Ford's claim based on these remarks must be understood in the context of a trial marred by considerable tension and, at times, open hostility, between the prosecutor and the defense counsel. Therefore, before addressing Ford's misconduct claims, I will recapitulate portions *382 of the record that place the prosecutor's remarks in appropriate light. 1. Two loci of tension between the parties were the testimony of Kevin McKinley and Corporal McEvoy. McKinley, the government's cooperator, had a lengthy criminal history that included a conviction for crack-cocaine distribution, 15 a charge for making terroristic threats in 2002, and, based on his having shot into the window of an occupied vehicle, convictions in 2003 for reckless endangerment and carrying an illegal firearm. Docket No. 80 at 62. Seeking to make McKinley's background more palatable to the jury, the prosecutor, in his opening argument, stressed that McKinley was to be respected for testifying at the risk of persons who would have him not testify who would intimidate him. Docket No. 79 at 25. I cautioned the prosecutor that this characterization was a little much. 16 Then, in her opening argument, Ford's counsel addressed McKinley's lengthy criminal history, which she characterized as a lifetime of crime, including [r]obberies, stabbings, drugs, drugs, drugs, and more drugs, and carrying a gun, sticking up people, and terrorizing people with that gun. Docket No. 79 at 29, 31 32. This characterization prompted the prosecutor not only to object, but also to accuse Ford's counsel, in open court, of making something up. 17 Docket No. 79 at 32. *383 Pursuant to both parties' objections, at sidebar I admonished both parties for their comments, stating that Mr. McGettigan [the prosecutor] doesn't need to say that, and I don't think we need to talk about terrifying ... the population. 18 Docket No. 79 at 32. Later, during his direct examination of McKinley, the prosecutor posed the following question to McKinley: Q. Okay, and I noticed you have difficulty walking up here. What's your present physical condition. A. I was shot. Docket No. 79 at 142. This inquiry drew a vigorous objection from Ford's counsel, who, at sidebar, argued that the prosecutor was trying to intimate that McKinley was shot in retaliation for testifying here and [that] he's afraid of people. Docket No. 79 at 143. The prosecutor represented that he was simply trying to explain the cause of McKinley's obvious injury, and that he had no intention of trying in any respect to impute [the shooting] to this defendant, or, at my prompting, to anybody. Docket No. 79 at 143. I cut off the prosecutor's inquiry and issued the following instruction: THE COURT: I think that the jury can disregard the nature of the witness's 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 10 \f U.S. v. Ford, 618 F.Supp.2d 368 (2009) injury. It doesn't figure into this case. He we'll trust he recovers quickly. Docket No. 79 at 144. the prosecutor's questions as As McKinley's direct examination continued, the prosecutor twice, in front of the jury, accused Ford's counsel of inappropriate conduct. First, during McKinley's direct examination, Ford's counsel successfully objected to several of leading. After one of these successful objections, the prosecutor openly complained that Ford's counsel doesn't understand what['s] leading. 19 *384 Docket No. 79 at 164. Second, during McKinley's cross-examination, the prosecutor objected when Ford's counsel inaccurately summarized part of McKinley's testimony. In doing so, the prosecutor accused Ford's counsel, in front of the jury, of intentionally misstating the testimony. Docket No. 80 at 31. I instructed the prosecutor that such editorializing during the objections is unnecessary. 20 Docket No. 80 at 32. The defense's examination of Corporal McEvoy prompted another heated exchange between the prosecutor and Ford's counsel. Corroborating McKinley's testimony that he exchanged drugs and money with Ford through a handshake, Corporal McEvoy testified on direct examination that he saw Ford and McKinley shake hands outside the Midway Diner on November 10. On cross-examination, Ford's counsel called the truthfulness of this testimony into question by highlighting that Corporal McEvoy's contemporaneous notes did not document this handshake or other observations to which he testified. Docket No. 80 at 124. On re-direct examination, the prosecutor asked McEvoy whether he would testify to anything falsely or that [he] did not recollect ... to convict Harold Ford or anybody else, to which Corporal McEvoy responded: Absolutely not. Docket No. 80 at 133. Ford's counsel conducted re-cross examination about this statement, and elicited testimony that Corporal McEvoy failed to inform the government that he was named, with other officers, as a defendant in a lawsuit alleging arrests based on an unlawful search: 21 *385 BY MS. LEFEBER: Q. When in preparation for your testimony here today, did you meet with Mr. McGettigan? [CPL. MCEVOY:] A. Yes, ma'am. Q. And, did he ask you whether or not there are any pending actions against you for false arrests? A. Yes, ma'am. Q. And, did you tell him absolutely not? A. Yes, ma'am. Q. And, that isn't true, is it, sir? A. No, ma'am. Q. There is a pending law suit in this district court house against you for participating in fabricating false arrests, correct? A. Ma'am, I believe your facts are far from true. Q. Well, let's put it this way. There is a pending action against you in your capacity as a Coatesville Police Officer in this United States District Courthouse, is that correct? A. As a member of the Chester County Municipal Drug Task Force, I was one of numerous officers named in a law suit stemming from a search warrant ... which had nothing to do with my testimony, ... false or true. Docket No. 80 at 133 34. In further re-direct examination, the prosecutor attempted to diminish the significance of Corporal McEvoy's omission in the following exchange: BY MR. MCGETTIGAN: Q. Did I ever ask you if you were involved in a law suit? [CPL. MCEVOY:] A. Yes, sir. Q. Did you tell me? A. I told you that I didn't I wasn't aware of anything that was pending against me. Q. Does this suit have anything to do MS. LEFEBER: Objection, Your Honor. There's nothing about what this law suit 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 11 \f U.S. v. Ford, 618 F.Supp.2d 368 (2009) THE COURT: Let's not do you have a question, Mr. McGettigan? BY MR. MCGETTIGAN: Q. Somebody you locked you up sued you, isn't that correct? A. Exactly. Q. Okay. Does that happen sometimes in your line of work? A. Yes, it does. Q. And oh, it was a drug offense they got locked up for too? A. Yes, sir. Q. Thank you very much. Just like this one? A. Yes, sir. THE COURT: Mr. McGettigan, that wasn't a useful remark. MR. MCGETTIGAN: I get [sic] your pardon. Docket No. 80 at 135 36. Tension between counsel was quite high at this point, as evidenced by the prosecutor accusing Ford's counsel, at sidebar, of lying in *386 claiming that Corporal McEvoy was alleged to have participated in the writing of false affidavits in support of the arrests. 22 Docket No. 80 at 136 37. 2. The parties' closing arguments were no less heated. The prosecutor was the first to summarize his case, and he began by recounting a fictional dialogue with an unnamed colleague in the prosecutor's office. In that fictional dialogue, the prosecutor would express his concerns about perceived weaknesses in the government's case, and the colleague would undertake to reassure the prosecutor. 23 Then, after addressing the credibility of the government's witnesses, the prosecutor recited what he characterized principles that apply to criminal cases generally. Docket No. 81 at 15. The prosecutor asserted that, under these general principles, *387 the defense's argument that Ford was not the person who distributed drugs to McKinley on November 10 was a defense of ... last resort. 24 Docket No. 81 at 16. In her closing argument, Ford's counsel challenged the prosecutor's characterization of Ford's defense as one of last resort. Docket No. 81 at 30 31. Ford's counsel then suggested that the government was trying to keep the truth from the jury by having refused, in the course of the trial, to stipulate to the fact that no drugs were found on Ford during his arrest, 25 and by objecting to Ford's request to play the tape of McKinley negotiating a drug transaction outside the Midway Diner during the period when he was, according to his testimony, waiting for Ford to return with the drugs. 26 *388 Docket No. 81 at 31 24. Elaborating on this point, Ford's counsel emphasized that the task force officers' contemporaneous notes did not corroborate McKinley's and McEvoy's testimony, and that other supporting evidence, such as telephone records corroborating McKinley's claim that he called Ford on November 10, just isn't here: They didn't arrest him for a year later, is the excuse. I suggest to you, ladies and gentlemen, they didn't arrest him for a year later, because they didn't believe their own case. Docket No. 81 at 37. Ford's counsel also aggressively questioned the truthfulness of both McKinley's and Corporal McEvoy's testimony. Ford's counsel characterized Corporal McEvoy as having made a deal with the devil in choosing to work with McKinley, Docket No. 81 at 34, and described McKinley's as a man that his entire adult life has engaged in drug dealing, carrying loaded weapons to enforce to get whatever he wanted to get. Recklessly endangering other people with guns. Shooting at people, stalking them, harassing them, assaulting them. Doing whatever he could to get his way. Docket No. 81 at 47 48. McKinley testified against Ford, defense counsel argued, because he realized that the jig [was] up when he was arrested in October 2005. Docket No. 81 at 48. Ford's counsel further argued that what the Government proved here beyond a reasonable doubt, is that Kevin McKinley should be sitting over there charged with the crimes that he committed, and he should be the one facing 30 years to life. Docket No. 81 at 49 50. Then, Ford's counsel urged the jury to ask whether Corporal McEvoy appear[ed] to ... have his own agenda in this case, Docket No. 81 at 50, and pointed to aspects of Corporal McEvoy's testimony that, 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 12 \f U.S. v. Ford, 618 F.Supp.2d 368 (2009) she argued, could support this conclusion. 27 After doing so, Ford's counsel highlighted the *389 prosecutor's question to Corporal McEvoy, on redirect examination, as to whether he would ever lie on the witness stand to convict Harold Ford: from you, well, as a lawyer, you don't have a whole lot, sometimes, but your good name and when you're accused personally . And it was I who had to remind him, oh, no you wouldn't? You lied to Mr. McGettigan when he asked you whether there were any pending cases against you in your capacity as a police officer in Coatesville, for making false affidavits against people to get them arrested. You lied to your own lawyer when he asked you that. And, of course, it's your recollection that counts. But I recall him saying, yeah. I didn't tell him about that. And this is not about that lawsuit, whether or not he lied to get other people arrested. It's not about that. It's about his character for truthfulness and whether or not he would lie to get Harold Ford convicted. And I submit to you, if he lied to his own lawyer, Mr. McGettigan, about a prior lawsuit that we learned are is actually pending in this courthouse, if he lied to his own the lawyer for the Government about that, he's lying to convict Harold Ford. Docket No. 81 at 53 54. 3. Against this background, the prosecutor began his rebuttal, which were the final remarks that the jury heard from either party, as follows: Thank you your Honor. Ladies and gentlemen, when counsel referred to the Government and the Government's lawyer, she was pointing at me. She should have been talking about Officer Corporal McEvoy back there, too. Now, I'm the Government lawyer. I'm not getting rich. If a trial goes a week, I got to wear the same suit twice. Docket No. 81 at 57. The prosecutor continued: Docket No. 81 at 57 58. Ford's counsel objected to this comment. Calling the parties to sidebar, I instructed the parties as follows: THE COURT: Ms. Lefeber, your argument is one that challenges the Government's readiness to present the truth, and so Mr. McGettigan is entitled to respond. The response, I think, should not be extensively personal, Mr. McGettigan.... [I]t's not a personal statement. It's a statement about the *390 Government and what the Government's responses and attitudes and responsibilities are. So, let's, from now on, have no more. Docket No. 81 at 58. The prosecutor's argument continued. After suggesting that the jury should reject the argument that the Government didn't want you to know the truth, the prosecutor, approaching the jury box, said: You know, phone records, that would have been a good idea. It wasn't my idea. But to say that the Government's counsel, the Government sought to conceal the truth from you, I submit goes beyond the pale. As does accusing an honorable, I would submit Docket No. 81 at 59. By this point, the prosecutor was fully facing the jury box and speaking at a volume too quiet to be heard by me or by the court reporter, and the transcript reflects this gap. At my request, the prosecutor continued at a louder volume: But when the Government wants to keep the truth counsel says, 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 13 \f U.S. v. Ford, 618 F.Supp.2d 368 (2009) You saw Officer McEvoy on the witness stand, Corporal McEvoy. And I'm sure you saw much of his much of his head that's visible get a little bit red as he was accused of things. Probably did, again. And you saw him ... accused here. As if he were being paid piecework. And I'd submit to you that he was an honorable police officer doing honorable work. And, instead, for his trouble, you saw him accused of being a liar, as if he would lie to convict Harold Ford. As if the Government's counsel would mislead you to convict Harold Ford. Docket No. 81 at 59 60. Ford's counsel again objected, and I cautioned the prosecutor that we're not going to be pursuing personal lines. Docket No. 81 at 60. The prosecutor then, after explaining that you're going to get called names in his line of profession, offered the following anecdote: I'm reminded by counsel's argument of something that occurred to me, not that long ago. I ran into a defense attorney who I knew and was friends with, from years gone by, and he was about to close to a jury early in the day. I said, hey, Brian, can I buy you lunch? He said, don't wait, it might take me a while to confuse the issue. And that's why I said what I had to say before counsel got up. Docket No. 81 at 60. Then, after addressing the credibility of Kevin's McKinley's testimony, the prosecutor commented on the defendant's failure to testify at trial: In addition, counsel, at one point, I think she said and I made a few notes here, that the defendant said, well, Mr. Ford doesn't have to say anything, and he didn't say anything. He hasn't said a word in this courtroom. So I don't know what she was referring to. Docket No. 81 at 62. The prosecutor went on to address Ford's counsel's suggestion that the government did not believe its own case and, in doing so, characterized the defendant's closing argument as a lot of lawyer noises being made there. 28 Docket No. 81 at 64. *391 Then, responding to the defense's characterization of McKinley's criminal history, the prosecutor revisited McKinley's statement that he had been shot, which I had previously instructed the jury to ignore: Counsel, I believe said, at least once or more than once, that Kevin shot somebody, he was shooting somebody to get whatever he wanted. As I recall, he got shot, not that he shot someone. Docket No. 81 at 65. Ford's counsel objected to this statement, which I overruled by saying I think the jury will remember and decide what was said. It's up to the jury. Docket No. 81 at 65. The prosecutor then continued his closing argument with this remark: At this moment, I'm reminded of a discussion I had outside of a courtroom one time, where I was trying to persuade a number of people, and I was interrupted by my opponent, my adversary in the argument. And eventually, after his second or third time, he said, hey, shut up, Joe you're making sense. Docket No. 81 at 65 66. I then issued another cautionary instruction, and the rest of the prosecutor's rebuttal continued without interruption. [7] Ford contends that, in his rebuttal, the prosecutor C. [6] committed misconduct by vouching for the credibility of the government witnesses and disparaging Ford's counsel. As the Supreme Court has observed in United States v. Young: The prosecutor's vouching for the credibility of witnesses and expressing his personal opinion concerning the guilt of two dangers: such comments can convey the that evidence not presented to the jury, but known to the prosecutor, supports the charges the accused pose impression 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 14 \f U.S. v. Ford, 618 F.Supp.2d 368 (2009) against the defendant and can thus jeopardize the defendant's right to be tried solely on the basis of the evidence presented to the jury; and the prosecutor's opinion carries with it the imprimatur of the Government and may induce the jury to trust the Government's judgment rather than its own view of the evidence. 470 U.S. at 18 19, 105 S.Ct. 1038. According to the Third Circuit, in order to establish that a prosecutor's remarks constitute improper vouching, two criteria must be met: (1) the prosecutor must assure the jury that the testimony of a Government witness is credible; and (2) this assurance is based on either the prosecutor's personal knowledge, or other information not contained in the record.' Kindler v. Horn, 542 F.3d 70, 87 (3d Cir.2008) (quoting United States v. Walker, 155 F.3d 180, 187 (3d Cir.1998)). The defendant must be able to identify as the basis for [the prosecutor's comment on witness credibility] explicit or implicit reference to either the personal knowledge of the prosecuting attorney or information not contained in the record. United States v. Brennan, 326 F.3d 176, 183 (3d Cir.2003) (alterations in original) (quoting Walker, 155 F.3d at 187). Linked to these vouching claims is Ford's contention that the prosecutor impugned the truthfulness of Ford's counsel based on information outside the record. See United States v. Rivas, 493 F.3d 131, 139 (3d Cir.2007) ( [T]he prohibition against personal attacks on attorneys is rooted less in a sense of decorum than in the same rule underlying the prohibition *392 on vouching: one cannot make arguments unsupported by the record evidence. ). The statements that ground this misconduct claim are interwoven with the remarks that, according to Ford, constituted personal assurances by the prosecutor as to the credibility of the government's witnesses. Therefore, in order to avoid drawing an artificial distinction between the contexts in which the remarks arose, I will analyze Ford's misconduct claims based on the prosecutor's disparagement of counsel together with his vouching claims. See, e.g., Young, 470 U.S. at 11, 105 S.Ct. 1038 ( [A] criminal conviction is not to be lightly overturned on the basis of a prosecutor's comments standing alone, for the statements or conduct must be viewed in context; only by doing so can it be determined whether the prosecutor's conduct affected the fairness of the trial. ). 1. The prosecutor's rebuttal was focused on bolstering the credibility of McKinley's and Corporal McEvoy's testimony. This focus was appropriate, as Ford's counsel called the truthfulness of those witnesses' testimony into question. However, in expressing his anger that Ford's counsel challenged the integrity of the government's case, the prosecutor remarks went beyond appealing to the evidence in the record and invoked the prestige of the government's office. [8] First, the prosecutor accused Ford's counsel of going beyond the pale in suggesting that the government was concealing the truth from the jury by failing to provide telephone records corroborating McKinley's testimony and by accusing an honorable officer of testifying untruthfully. Continuing with this argument, the prosecutor undertook to assure the jury that Corporal McEvoy was an honorable police officer and equated the integrity of the challenged law-enforcement-officer witness with integrity of Government counsel i.e., the prosecutor himself: the I'd submit to you that [McEvoy] was an honorable police officer doing honorable work. And, instead, for his trouble, you saw him accused of being a liar, as if he would lie to convict Harold Ford. As if the Government's counsel would mislead you to convict Harold Ford. Docket No. 81 at 60. [9] The government contends that the prosecutor did not, at any point during the course in these remarks, offer a personal opinion as to the credibility of the witnesses. However, a prosecutor's assurance of a witness's credibility is impermissible if it is based on either an explicit or implicit reference to ... the personal knowledge of the prosecuting attorney. See Brennan, 326 F.3d at 183. The Third Circuit has held that prosecutorial remarks that may be construed as invoking the integrity of the government may be appropriate if, when the remarks are considered in context, it is clear that the prosecutor was making a specific argument, based on the 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 15 \f U.S. v. Ford, 618 F.Supp.2d 368 (2009) trial record, about the government's veracity. For example, in Brennan, the court considered a closing argument that the prosecutor initiated by saying that one hallmark of our system is that we don't make accusations without proof. Id. at 185. The court acknowledged that, read in isolation, this remark could be read to suggest that evidence outside the record demonstrated [the defendant's] guilt. Id. However, the court observed that immediately following his assertion that the Government does not make accusations without proof, the prosecutor directed the jury to consider the corroborating evidence and [a witness's] demeanor during his five days of testimony. Id. at 186. Therefore, the Brennan court determined, the statement at issue, *393 taken in context, was a legitimate attack on the defendant's case. Similarly, in United States v. Walker, 155 F.3d 180 (3d Cir.1998), the court held that it was permissible to ask the jury what motivation a testifying officer had to lie in order to draw attention to the lack of evidence supporting the defendant's challenge to the officer's truthfulness. Id. at 186. In this case, by contrast, several of the prosecutor's objected- to remarks during rebuttal particularly his statement that it was beyond the pale for Ford's counsel to challenge the truthfulness of the government's case and his expression of offense ( [a]s if the Government's counsel would mislead you to convict Harold Ford ) were not tethered to the record. When viewed in context a context that includes other, milder forms of vouching 29 as well as the prosecutor's attacks on Ford's counsel and his characterization of the defense's closing argument as an insult to his good name 30 the prosecutor's remarks were, quite plainly, decoupled from the record. Nor is there reason to regard the remarks as simply being regrettable but excusably inartful turns of phrase. They were remarks with the clear potential of artificially magnifying the government's credibility in the eyes of the jury, whether or not they were so intended. Thus, with these statements, the prosecutor went beyond asking the jury what motivation Corporal McEvoy had to lie, or what motivation the government had to withhold the truth, and managed to invoke the government's prestige in bolstering its witnesses' credibility. 31 [10] The prosecutor's remarks, taken in context, thus closely resemble those that the court found improper in United States v. Dispoz O Plastics, Inc., 172 F.3d 275, 283 (3d Cir.1999), where the prosecutor bolstered the credibility of a cooperating witness by assuring the jury that the government *394 does not give two for one deals. They also evoke the remarks that the court found impermissible in United States v. Molina Guevara, 96 F.3d 698, 704 05 (3d Cir.1996), where the prosecutor told the jury that it was insulting and ridiculous' to think that the United States would put on a witness who would lie. See also United States v. DiLoreto, 888 F.2d 996, 998 99 (3d Cir.1989) (holding that vouching occurred where the prosecutor asserted that [w]e [the government] don't take liars. We don't put liars on the stand. We don't do that ), overruled on other grounds by Zehrbach, 47 F.3d 1252 (holding that prosecutorial misconduct is not reversible per se and must be reviewed for harmless error). Here, as in those cases, the prosecutor did not defend the witnesses' credibility based on inferences that could be drawn from the evidence. Instead, the prosecutor relied on the prestige of his office to counter the suspicions that Ford's counsel attempted to convey to the jury through arguments that, while aggressive, were grounded in the record. 32 This is misconduct. 2. [11] Also problematic were the prosecutor's remarks disparaging not just Ford's counsel, but the criminal defense bar more generally. In response to objections by Ford's counsel to the prosecutor's rebuttal, the prosecutor offered the two anecdotes described above, relating tales about how defense attorneys generally try to confuse the issue[s] and prevent government attorneys from making sense. See supra section IIB3 (explaining the content of the prosecutor's rebuttal). These comments were manifestly inappropriate. The anecdotes served no purpose other than to encourage a juror to reject the defendant's arguments based on its skepticism of the criminal defense system, rather than on the strength of the government's evidence. They bore no relationship to the evidence at bar, and they were incompatible with the constraints *395 that guide a prosecutor. See ABA Standards for Criminal Justice (3d ed. 1993) 3 5.8(c) ( The prosecutor should not make arguments calculated to appeal to the prejudices of the jury. ), 3 5.8(d) ( The prosecutor should refrain from argument which would divert the jury from its duty to decide the case on the evidence. ). 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 16 \f U.S. v. Ford, 618 F.Supp.2d 368 (2009) The government argues that these remarks were direct comments on defense tactics, specifically Ford's counsel having interrupted the prosecutor's rebuttal with objections, and therefore they were not improper. Docket No. 89 at 28 29. This is incorrect for three reasons: First, Ford's counsel's objections to the prosecutor's rebuttal were appropriate responses to the prosecutor's remarks and, indeed, necessary to preserve Ford's misconduct claims for review. [12] Second, while the prosecutor may be permitted to comment on specific, inappropriate defense arguments for the purpose of tempering any clearly unwarranted juror suspicions of the government's case that such arguments may give rise to, the prosecutor is not permitted to do so in a way that is itself calculated to inflame the jury's prejudices. See, e.g., Dispoz O Plastics, Inc., 172 F.3d at 284 85 (holding that the invited response doctrine may not be used as a springboard to launch[ ] affirmative attacks upon defendants ). Thus, regardless of whether the prosecutor's observations were uttered in response to what the prosecutor perceived to be an inappropriate defense tactic, the prosecutor engaged in misconduct. Third, the prosecutor's anecdotes do not appear to have been addressed to a specific defense tactic. The prosecutor cast his insults in general terms, and did not comment upon specific behavior by Ford's counsel that he deemed inappropriate. More tellingly, the prosecutor's inappropriate remarks were not isolated responses to perceived defense challenges. Later in his rebuttal, the prosecutor characterized the defense's closing arguments as a lot of lawyer noises being made there. Furthermore, the prosecutor's attacks during rebuttal echoed inappropriate and inflammatory accusations that he earlier made in open court, such as the charge, made during Ford's counsel's opening statement, that she was making something up. 33 *396 Those earlier accusations antedated Ford's counsel's closing argument, which belies the government's argument that the prosecutor's attacks during rebuttal were a measured response to specific defense tactics. I therefore find that the prosecutor's attacks on Ford's counsel and the defense bar generally cannot be justified as comments made in reasonable response to improper attacks by defense counsel. 3. [13] In addition to making personal assurances about the credibility of the government's witnesses and offering inappropriate remarks about Ford's counsel, the prosecutor attempted to bolster McKinley's credibility through evidence outside the record. Early in McKinley's direct examination, the prosecutor elicited testimony that McKinley had been shot, but assured the court that he had no intention of trying in any respect to impute McKinley's shooting to Ford. I instructed the jury to disregard this testimony. Docket No. 79 at 143 44. Nevertheless, in his rebuttal, the prosecutor said: Counsel, I believe said, at least once or more than once, that Kevin shot somebody, he was shooting somebody to get whatever he wanted. As I recall, he got shot, not that he shot someone. Docket No. 81 at 65. The government does not address this comment even though Ford objected to it at trial and raised it in his Rule 29 motion. I nonetheless note that the comment not only refers to testimony the jury was specifically instructed to disregard, but also incorrectly suggests that there was no evidence supporting Ford's counsel's comment, in her opening argument, that McKinley's criminal history included [s]hooting at people. Docket No. 81 at 48. In fact, McKinley testified that he pleaded guilty in 2003 to reckless endangerment for shooting into the window of an occupied vehicle, Docket No. 80 at 62 63. Additionally, this comment by the prosecutor in his rebuttal came at the conclusion of a trial in which the prosecutor repeatedly focused the jury's attention on threats that were allegedly directed toward McKinley. First, in his opening statement, the prosecutor advised the jurors that McKinley cooperated with the government at some apprehension and risk to himself, and that McKinley was testifying at the risk of persons who would have him not testify and who would intimidate him. Docket No. 79 at 24 25. Later, the prosecutor attempted to ask Agent Wood [w]hat would have happened to Kevin McKinley if Harold Ford had been arres[ted] in 2005. Docket No. 80 at 154 55. 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 17 \f U.S. v. Ford, 618 F.Supp.2d 368 (2009) Unfortunately, I must conclude that the prosecutor's rebuttal effectively undermined his prior assurance that he had no intention of trying in any respect to impute [the shooting] to this defendant. I therefore conclude that the prosecutor's reference to McKinley's shooting was made to bolster McKinley's credibility and inflame the jury's prejudices against the defendant based on information not contained in the record. D. Having identified instances of prosecutorial misconduct- improper vouching, inappropriate disparaging of Ford's counsel and the defense bar generally, and prejudicially referring to extra-record information *397 to which Ford raised contemporaneous objections, I must consider whether these claims constituted harmless error. 34 I will undertake this review in accordance with the harmless error standard set forth in Zehrbach: The harmless error doctrine requires that the court consider an error in light of the record as a whole, but the standard of review in determining whether an error is harmless depends on whether the error was constitutional or non- constitutional. In this instance, the alleged error, attacking the credibility of a witness with evidence not in the record, is non-constitutional. We have held that non-constitutional error is harmless when it is highly probable that the error did not contribute to the judgment. High probability requires that the court possess a sure conviction that the error did not prejudice the defendant. 47 F.3d at 1265 (citations omitted; emphasis in original). I will treat defendant's charges as claims of non- constitutional error for the purpose of this review. See, e.g., United States v. Weatherly, 525 F.3d 265, 273 (3d Cir.2008) (reviewing vouching claims for non- constitutional error); but see Molina Guevara, 96 F.3d 698, 705 (3d Cir.1996) (reviewing vouching that allegedly violated a defendant's Sixth Amendment rights for constitutional error). Therefore, having determined that misconduct has occurred, I must consider whether I am left with a sure conviction that the error did not prejudice the defendant. Zehrbach, 47 F.3d at 1265. [14] The test for determining prejudice, under this standard, is tripartite. The factors to be examined are the scope of the comments and their relationship to the proceeding, the extent of any curative instructions, and the strength of the evidence against the defendants. Dispoz O Plastics, Inc., 172 F.3d at 286 (citing Zehrbach, 47 F.3d at 1265). [15] First, as to the scope of the comments made by the prosecutor during rebuttal and their relationship to the proceeding, the prosecutor vouched repeatedly, including when he characterized Ford's defense strategy as one of last resort, Docket 81 at 15 16, and addressed the lawsuit against Corporal McEvoy, by saying that his fictional colleague said, well, weren't you, the defense attorney and the Judge in your last drug case all sued? Docket No. 81 at 12. The prosecutor's attacks on Ford's counsel and his comments alluding to McKinley's shooting and to Corporal McEvoy were plainly intended to bolster McKinley's and McEvoy's testimony. As McKinley was the government's only eyewitness to Ford's distribution of cocaine base on November 10, and the record contained recordings that are not clearly in harmony with McKinley's testimony, any information that would bolster McKinley's credibility including McEvoy's testimony that he observed a handshake between Ford and McKinley could have been pivotal in persuading a jury of Ford's guilt. Cf. Werts v. Vaughn, 228 F.3d 178, 200 (3d Cir.2000) (finding that prosecutor's comments were harmless where they were not based on information *398 not presented to the jury and where the record contained ample evidence of the defendant's guilt). Moreover, the comments at issue occurred during the government's rebuttal, which was the final statement to the jury by either attorney, and could therefore have carried undue weight with the jury as they began their deliberations. Second, I did not issue any specific, curative instructions to address the prosecutor's remarks. I informally conveyed displeasure with some of the prosecutor's attacks on Ford's counsel, and issued a general instruction, in the jury charge, that [w]hat the attorneys have said ... is not evidence. But see Dispoz O Plastics, 172 F.3d at 287 (finding that a general instruction to evaluate witnesses' credibility based on their testimony was not sufficient to neutralize the harm caused by a specific instance of prosecutorial vouching). Moreover, it is quite possible that one of my instructions may inadvertently have exacerbated the effect of the prosecutor's misconduct: after the prosecutor reminded the jury that McKinley got shot, I allowed 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 18 \f U.S. v. Ford, 618 F.Supp.2d 368 (2009) the prosecutor to continue his rebuttal over the defendant's objection and said that I think the jury will remember and decide what was said. It's up to the jury. Docket No. 81 at 65. Unfortunately, a juror may have reasonably construed this statement as permitting the jury to ignore my earlier instruction to disregard McKinley's testimony about being shot. My response to Ford's objection during the prosecutor's rebuttal may therefore have aggravated whatever degree of prejudice might have ensued from the prosecutor's statement had I remained silent. See United States v. Mastrangelo, 172 F.3d 288, 295 98 (3d Cir.1999) (reversing for prosecutorial misconduct where the district court's faulty curative instruction exacerbated the prejudice caused by a prosecutor's remark). Third, I must evaluate the effect of the prosecutor's remarks in light of the strength of the evidence against Ford. As addressed above, the government's evidence against Ford was far from overwhelming, and a reasonable juror could have concluded, from that evidence, that Ford was not the individual from whom McKinley purchased cocaine base on November 10, 2005. Unless a reasonable juror were to credit McKinley's testimony, he would be left without sufficient evidence from which to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Harold Ford, rather than one of the other individuals with whom McKinley negotiated drug purchases on November 10, sold cocaine base to McKinley that day. Ultimately, having balanced these factors in considering the effect of prosecutor's remarks during his rebuttal, I cannot say that I am left with a sure conviction that the error did not prejudice the defendant. Zehrbach, 47 F.3d at 1265. In a trial that was interlarded with gratuitous attacks by both parties, it would hardly be surprising that the prosecutor was tempted, at times, to engage in inappropriate conduct. Ford's defense, and particularly the closing argument of his counsel, challenged the integrity of both the prosecutor and the government's witnesses. These challenges merited a vigorous response. Unfortunately, however, the prosecutor went beyond any response that was warranted. The prosecutor's inappropriate comments bolstered the credibility of witnesses whose testimony, in light of the weakness of the government's evidence, was necessary to secure Ford's conviction. Consequently, I must conclude that there is not a high probability that the prosecutorial misconduct in this case did not contribute to the jury's verdict. IV. Conclusion In this opinion I have described two courtroom aspects of this case that made *399 for a difficult trial. The first was the pervasive acrimony that colored the interactions between the lawyer representing the United States and the lawyer representing Harold Ford. The second closely related to the first was the prosecutor's drumbeat of derision, not simply for opposing counsel but for those lawyers, as a class, who are engaged in the representation of criminal defendants, to the point of suggesting that such lawyers engage in deliberate deception. This was, in my view, the worst of the prosecutor's offenses. The recitals, in his closing- argument-rebuttal, of statements he attributed to members of the criminal defense bar could only have been intended to convey the view that criminal defense attorneys have as their goals confus [ing] the issue[s] and preventing the government from making sense. This belittling of the criminal defense process extended also to the prosecutor's characterization of the defense of misidentification as a defense of last resort. 35 By anecdote and innuendo, criminal defense lawyers were portrayed for the jury as persons whose expected and habitual professional role is to mislead the jury by distorting, or hiding, the truth through a criminal defense process that encourages such deception. For counsel for the United States to show such disrespect and, indeed, disdain for crucial ingredients of constitutional processes developed over centuries was inexcusable. A reader of this transcript could well say that a prosecutor behaving in this fashion should have been called to account, early and often, by the judge. Such criticism would be appropriate. In reading over the transcript I found myself, at many points, troubled that I had not stepped in and directed the prosecutor to cease behaving in a fashion signally inappropriate for a government's lawyer. Too often I was too mild in reproof or simply directed the prosecutor to move on. One could, therefore, argue that it is not merely unbecoming, but far too late in the day, for the judge to determine that the prosecutor committed misconduct. But that begs the issue. The question is whether the prosecutor's unhappy behavior may have caused substantial damage to the integrity of the trial, thus prejudicing the defendant. With this in mind, one recognizes that the judge's unduly tepid response to the prosecutor's behavior was not likely to have done much 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 19 \f U.S. v. Ford, 618 F.Supp.2d 368 (2009) to insure that the defendant was accorded the fair process that was his due. Accordingly, because I believe that there is a significant possibility that the fairness of the jury's verdict may have been threatened by the prosecutorial vouching and attacks on the defendant's counsel, I will exercise my discretion to set aside the jury's verdict on count one of the indictment and grant Ford a new trial. Footnotes 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 In moving for acquittal due to prosecutorial misconduct, Ford mistakes his remedy. A finding of prosecutorial misconduct would call for setting aside the verdict with a view to retrial (Rule 33(a)), not entering a judgment of acquittal. Specifically, the grand jury charged that (1) [o]n or about November 10, 2005, Ford knowingly and intentionally distributed approximately 5 grams or more ... of a mixture and substance containing a detectable amount of cocaine base ( crack ), and (2) [o]n or about November 17, 2005, Ford knowingly and intentionally distributed approximately 5 grams or more ... of a mixture and substance containing a detectable amount of cocaine base ( crack ). Docket No. 10. McKinley testified that, in June 1997, he pled guilty to distributing crack cocaine [o]n a number of occasions. Docket No. 80 (Transcript of Trial, January 25, 2008) at 60. Sergeant Farley testified that, while he could hear McKinley's part of these telephone conversations, and the recordings included each speaker in a telephone conversation, Sergeant Farley could not himself hear the party speaking at the other end of the line. Docket No. 79 at 42. The transcript that the government had originally drafted reported Speaker 2 as saying I need that I need that A Stem. Docket No. 78 (Transcript of Trial, January 23, 2008) at 32. Prior to trial, the government edited the transcript to read: I need that I need that H Town. McKinley testified at trial that H Town is slang for half an ounce of crack cocaine, Docket No. 80 at 24, and that a pipe used to smoke crack cocaine is referred to as a stem. Docket No. 80 at 35. At a pretrial hearing, I directed the government to revise the transcript to be presented to the jury to include both possible interpretations of the recording. Docket No. 78 at 49 50. Sergeant Farley's testimony was based on his contemporaneous notes of what was being reported to him by other members of the task force. Though he did not personally observe McKinley during the transaction, Sergeant Farley testified that, while the operation was taking place, he took approximately four pages of notes of what other members of the task force were reporting to him. Docket No. 79 at 71 72. Sergeant Farley also testified that, after the transaction, took place, he met with McKinley, dictated McKinley's account of the transaction, and had McKinley read and correct any inaccuracies in the transcribed account. Docket No. 79 at 48 49. This testimony is consistent with the signed statement that McKinley gave to Sergeant Farley, at approximately 1:30 pm on the day in question: We talked about the purchase of one-half ounce of crack. [Ford] then told me that he had to go to Merchant Street to get the half ounce. Docket No. 79 at 94 95. Corporal McEvoy, who was conducting surveillance of McKinley, testified that he could not recall whether or not McKinley went inside the Midway Diner at any time. Docket No. 80 at 125. In her closing argument, Ford's counsel said that the alleged transaction between Ford and McKinley was at least a block and a half to two blocks from where [McEvoy] was situated. Docket No. 81 (Transcript of Trial, January 28, 2008) at 52. The government charges Ford's counsel with misstating Corporal McEvoy's testimony, and claims that Corporal McEvoy testified that he was less than four feet from the two men when they shook hands and, according to the government, engaged in the drug transaction. Docket No. 89 at 9 (citing Docket No. 80 at 102). The government's characterization of Corporal McEvoy's testimony is incorrect. Corporal McEvoy testified that he began observing McKinley from a position approximately two blocks east of th[e] bar where McKinley met Ford, and that he moved his vehicle so that he was eventually observing McKinley from approximately a block and a half from the bar. Docket No. 80 at 98 100. Corporal McEvoy testified that he saw Ford meet McKinley in front of the bar and then leave for a few minutes. Corporal McEvoy then testified that, when he again saw Ford and McKinley together in front of the bar, they were approximately four feet or less from each other. Docket No. 80 at 102. 10 Corporal McEvoy testified that he took no notes of his observations on November 10 and, concomitantly, that he had no contemporaneous record of witnessing a handshake between Ford and McKinley. Sergeant Farley testified that neither his contemporaneous notes of what was being reported to him by the task force members, nor his later reports, based 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 20 \f U.S. v. Ford, 618 F.Supp.2d 368 (2009) on discussions with his fellow officers, indicated that any of the task force members witnessed an exchange between Ford and McKinley on November 10. Docket No. 79 at 73 74. The transcript presented to the jury, which omits the speakers' identities, reads as follows ( - denotes a break in the sentence and, at times, a change in the speaker): 11 -I will be right with you ... -Hey, what's up, you want to go over there ... hit me man. (Speakers walking unintelligible conversation) -That's what I am telling you like -He's nuts ... it's a rap. -What's this? -Oh man you own the highway, you own the highway. Forte I want ... you the big man down here, you worrying about comm' on comm' on man -I don't got nothing -Where you going to be at ... you had coke here -No the cops ... listen I was driving and they started following me, so I had to go and stash it -How much, how much did you stash? -Nine ounces -I did ...

N 28. 12 As I will address in more detail below, the Sentencing Guidelines define crack cocaine as a form of cocaine base, usually prepared by processing cocaine hydrochloride and sodium bicarbonate, and usually appearing in a lumpy, rocklike form. U.S.S.G. 2D 1.1(d). 13 While McKinley testified at one point that he had not entered the restaurant, he did so tentatively. On direct examination, McKinley testified: Q. And did you go into the Midway at any time during your A. I don't remember. I might have. I might have stepped in there. I might have stepped out. Q. Did you leave the general area? A. No. Q. Okay, so you were either in front of or went into the Midway maybe? A. I was directly in front of it. I didn't go nowhere. Q. Okay. Do you recall if you went in or not or you're not sure? A. I didn't go in. Docket No. 79 at 159 60. During cross-examination, McKinley went on to testify as follows: Q. Now did you tell us yesterday that you never went into the Midway Diner on November the 10th? A. I wasn't two years ago I wasn't sure of every movement. I don't know if I briefly stopped in there or if I stayed outside. But, I'm most likely positive I was outside the whole time. Q. Okay. So, you're most likely positive that you were outside the whole time. So that, if Sgt. Farley testified that you went inside, he would be mistaken? A. Probably so. It was two years ago to him too. He's probably not sure of every movement too. 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 21 \f U.S. v. Ford, 618 F.Supp.2d 368 (2009) Docket No. 80 at 30 31. 14 15 16 The Third Circuit has explained the distinction between crack and freebase, another form of cocaine base, as follows: Cocaine is a naturally occurring substance that is derived from the leaves of the erythroxylon plant. United States Sentencing Commission, Special Report to the Congress: Cocaine and Federal Sentencing Policy, at vi (1995) [hereinafter Special Report ]. There are five basic forms of the drug: coca leaves, coca paste, powder cocaine, freebase cocaine, and crack cocaine. Id. at 11. There are three base forms of cocaine: coca paste, freebase cocaine, and crack cocaine. Id. Coca paste, not usually imported into the United States, is a chunky, off-white to light-brown, putty-like substance that exists primarily as an intermediate product in the processing of coca leaves into powder cocaine. Id. Both freebase cocaine and crack cocaine are forms of cocaine base produced from powder cocaine. Id. at 13. In this form, the powder cocaine has been freed from the salt substrate and is once again in a base form similar to that of coca paste. Id. To create freebase cocaine, powder cocaine is dissolved in water and a strong alkaloid solution, typically ammonia is added, along with another organic solvent like ether. Id. The use of this process was first documented in the 1970s, but many resisted the freebasing process because of its complexity and potential danger. Ether, a highly volatile and flammable solvent, will ignite or explode if the freebase cocaine is smoked before the ether has evaporated entirely. Id. Cocaine base prepared using the freebase method was replaced by the crack method. See, e.g., United States v. Johnson, 976 F.Supp. 284, 290 (D.Del.1997) ( [F]reebase cocaine ... seems to have outlived its utility with the emergence of crack cocaine. ) To produce crack cocaine, the powder cocaine is dissolved in a solution of sodium bicarbonate and water, which is then cooked, leaving a solid substance called crack cocaine. Special Report at 14. The crack cocaine is broken or cut into rocks, each typically weighing from one-tenth to one-half a gram. Id. This method is considered to be the most common method of producing cocaine base. See United States v. Barbosa, 271 F.3d 438, 462 (3d Cir.2001). Crack is not a chemical term; it describes a substance that results from a general method for making cocaine base out of powder cocaine. See United States v. Waters, 313 F.3d 151, 156 (3d Cir.2002). The Sentencing Guidelines note, [c]rack is the street name for a form of cocaine base, usually prepared by processing cocaine hydrochloride and sodium bicarbonate, and usually appearing in a lumpy rocklike form. U.S.S.G. 2D1.1(c), Note D. See also Waters, 313 F.3d at 156. United States v. Brigman, 350 F.3d 310, 312 13 (3d Cir.2003) (determining that, for purposes of calculating defendant's sentence under the then-mandatory sentencing guidelines, government had proved by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant distributed crack cocaine), abrogated by United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). See supra note 3. My cautionary remark was prompted by an objection by Ford's counsel, in an exchange that proceeded as follows: Mr. MCGETTIGAN: ... Scrutinize [McKinley's] testimony and consider it, but give him the respect that is due to a person who at some apprehension and risk to himself cooperated in [sic] the Government with the Government in addressing the serious problem of drug sales and at risk MS. LEFEBER: Objection, Your Honor. THE COURT: Overruled. MR. MCGETTIGAN: And notwithstanding that this has not made him a popular person in the community of Coatesville and at the risk of persons who would have him not testify who would intimidate him MS. LEFEBER: Objection, Your Honor. MR. MCGETTIGAN: to come in here and testify MS. LEFEBER: Objection. THE COURT: I think that's a little much, Mr. McGettigan. MR. MCGETTIGAN: I'll move on, Your Honor. THE COURT: Yeah, let's leave that alone. All right? Docket No. 79 at 24 25. 17 The government accuses Ford's counsel of fabricating aspects of McKinley's criminal history during this argument. While Ford's counsel was permitted to cross-examine McKinley about his convictions for drug distribution and shooting into the window of an occupied vehicle, counsel's opening argument did allude to aspects of McKinley's criminal history that she 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 22 \f U.S. v. Ford, 618 F.Supp.2d 368 (2009) 18 was ultimately barred from inquiring into at trial. However, she had a good-faith basis for making these allusions. At one of several pretrial conferences held the week before trial for the purpose of addressing discovery disputes, the prosecutor confirmed that the government had not produced evidence of Kevin McKinley's criminal history, despite the defendant having requested the material in discovery motions filed several months before trial, pursuant to Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150, 92 S.Ct. 763, 31 L.Ed.2d 104 (1972). Docket No. 76 (Transcript of Pretrial Conference, January 17, 2008) at 10 13. (Ford's counsel represented, at these conferences, that the government had also failed to produce other evidence to which the defendant was entitled, including audible copies of the recordings that constituted the prosecution's primary evidence against Ford.) I directed the government to authorize the Chester County probation department to produce a copy of McKinley's most recent presentence investigation ( PSI ) report, which the government theretofore had not done. At a subsequent pretrial conference, after Ford received a copy of McKinley's PSI report, I granted Ford's counsel permission to cross-examine Mr. McKinley, at trial, as to each of the arrests reported in the PSI report. Docket No. 78 at 11 12. My subsequent evidentiary rulings at trial in part limiting Ford's counsel's cross-examination of McKinley with regard to his prior convictions were not entirely consistent with this earlier determination. The full exchange is as follows: MS. LEFEBER: The entire case depends on Mr. McKinley's word. The evidence will show that he's led a lifetime of crime, and his word can't be believed. Robberies, stabbings, drugs, drugs, drugs, and more drugs. That was how he supported himself, and every all the time that he was wheeling and dealing drugs on the streets of Coatesville in front of the Midway Diner and VFW bar, he was carrying a gun, sticking up people, and terrorizing people with that gun. MR. MCGETTIGAN: Your Honor MS. LEFEBER: But things change. MR. MCGETTIGAN: You're Honor, excuse me. Your Honor, I'm going to object. Counsel is THE COURT: All right. MR. MCGETTIGAN: making something up here. THE COURT: I don't think we need to pursue that. MS. LEFEBER: Could we ask Mr. McGettigan not to make statements like counsel is making something up. I think that's inappropriate. THE COURT: I don't think I think Mr. McGettigan doesn't need to say that, and I don't think we need to talk about terrifying MS. LEFEBER: Things THE COURT: the population. Docket No. 79 at 31 32. 19 This exchange proceeded as follows: [BY MR. MCGETTIGAN] Q. Okay. And eventually as a result of those phone calls, did you make a phone call and contact the defendant, Harold Ford? [MCKINLEY] A. Yes. MS. LEFEBER: Objection, Your Honor. Can we like not lead the witness? MR. MCGETTIGAN: Your Honor, that's not a leading question. MS. LEFEBER: Just ask him who you called and MR. MCGETTIGAN: Your Honor, with all due respect MS. LEFEBER: not spoon feed him? MR. MCGETTIGAN: Counsel doesn't understand what['s] leading that's not MS. LEFEBER: Objection. MR. MCGETTIGAN: a leading question. MS. LEFEBER: You know, these kind of remarks in front of the jury are inappropriate. THE COURT: That was a little more leading, Mr. McGettigan, than is necessary. Docket No. 79 at 163 64. The exchange proceed as follows: 20 [BY MS. LEFEBER]: Q. Now did you tell us yesterday that you never went into the Midway Diner on November the 10th? A. I wasn't sure. 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 23 \f U.S. v. Ford, 618 F.Supp.2d 368 (2009) Q. You weren't sure? A. [MCKINLEY]: I wasn't two years ago I wasn't sure of every movement. I don't know if I briefly stopped in there or if I stayed outside. But, I'm most likely positive I was outside the whole time. Q. Okay. So, you're most likely positive that you were outside the whole time. So that, if Sgt. Farley testified that you went inside, he would be mistaken? A. Probably so. It was two years ago to him too. He's probably not sure of every movement too. Q. Oh, okay. Now you say after you met Harold Ford either inside our outside of the Midway Diner on November the 10th, MR. MCGETTIGAN: Excuse me. BY MS. LEFEBER: Q. that he MR. MCGETTIGAN: Objection. That misstates his testimony. He never said he met Mr. Ford inside the Midway Diner BY MS LEFEBER: Q. Well, MR. MCGETTIGAN: ever BY MS LEFEBER: Q. you met him, right, either inside or outside. You can't remember, right? MR. MCGETTIGAN: Excuse me. Objection. That misstates his testimony as well. He doesn't say can't [sic] remember where he met Mr. Ford. And, counsel is intentionally misstating the testimony. MS LEFEBER: Your Honor, that's rude. THE COURT: Mr. McGettigan, I think I think it's unnecessary to characterize counsel as having intentionally done anything. MR. MCGETTIGAN: I beg your pardon, Your Honor. THE COURT: If you have an objection to make, you can make the objection. But, the editorializing is unnecessary. Docket No. 80 at 30 32. 21 See Pitner v. Murrin, Civil No. 07 355 (E.D. Pa. filed January 29, 2007). In Pitner, the plaintiffs alleged that Corporal McEvoy and other officers engaged in a search that was undertaken pursuant to a warrant, but which was nonetheless unlawful. Pitner v. Murrin, Civil No. 07 355 (E.D. Pa. filed January 29, 2007). Specifically, plaintiffs alleged that, to obtain the search warrant, the officers filed an affidavit stating that one of the plaintiffs, driving a Ford Bronco, picked up a street- level drug dealer, who had informed an undercover agent that he was waiting to get marijuana from his supplier, and that the street-level dealer soon returned with marijuana on hand. See id., Second Am. Compl. 18. Plaintiffs further alleged that, prior to executing their search, the officers had no information that plaintiffs were involved in any criminal activity. Id. 36. After Ford's trial, the court awarded summary judgment to defendants and, in so doing, found that Corporal McEvoy did not swear to the facts alleged in the affidavit, and did not participate in drafting the affidavit. See Pitner v. Murrin, Civil No. 07 355, 2008 WL 2552807, at *1 (E.D.Pa. June 25, 2008). 22 While it may be the case that the cross-examination of Corporal McEvoy should have been curtailed given the minimal probative value of the inquiry, Ford's counsel was not, in fact, lying. In their second amended complaint, in Pitner v. Murrin, described in footnote 21, supra, plaintiffs alleged that, although McEvoy did not sign the affidavit used to obtain the search warrant, he was one of the affiants. Second Amended Complaint 16, Pitner, No. 07 355. The prosecutor presented this fictional dialogue as follows: 23 And I'll tell you, in thinking about a case, even relatively brief cases, sometimes lawyers will discuss with their colleagues, and I think, what's the expression, you look for a devil's advocate, and you talk about your case a little bit. And, now, you can do that in this case. One of the things you can say is gee, you know, I would have liked to have had an officer who was placing recorders and transmitters, who was really familiar with Coatesville, who wasn't a University of Pennsylvania officer. And then my colleague would say, well, isn't Coatesville a small town with maybe just one or two police officers devoted to narcotics? So you'd have to have a task force, you have to have others. Okay. Fine. But then I said, well, gee, I'd really like to have a witness buy a half an ounce and an ounce of drugs, who didn't have a lengthy criminal history involving drugs and contact with criminals and stuff like that. And my colleague would say, well, gee, a nun, a priest, a person with no criminal history might have a tough time buying an ounce or two, or an ounce, or a half ounce of crack cocaine in Coatesville. 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 24 \f U.S. v. Ford, 618 F.Supp.2d 368 (2009) So I had to admit, there is some sense in that. So then you say, geez, you think I could have recorded tapes that didn't have a lot of background noise, and that you can hear audibly and just more of them. And my colleague would say, well, it's probably not reasonable to shut down traffic on Main Street in Coatesville and putting [sic] a big, visible microphone on your cooperator. It really might not be conducive to being able to buy drugs. So I said, well, gee, you know, I'd really like to have an agent who could drive to an unfamiliar place, use a two-way radio, follow people while they're walking, not be seen and take notes, all at the same time. And my colleague said, well when they get an agent with three arms, you'll probably get that. I said, hum, I'd like someone to be real close to these transactions. They said, that's pretty hard to do in an urban area where the police might be known. And, finally, I said, gee, you know, can I have a police officer who hasn't been sued? And my colleague said, well, weren't you, the defense attorney and the Judge in your last drug case all sued? And I had to admit, he had a point. You can sue anyone you want. Docket No. 81 (Transcript of Trial, January 28, 2008) at 10 12. Then, while addressing the reliability of Kevin McKinley's testimony, the prosecutor continued: And that's one other thing I asked my colleague. I said, you know, you'd think I could have a witness who would speak up, who would really stand get next to that microphone and talk to the Court. And my colleague said, well, those are the actors, not real people. Docket No. 81 at 14. The prosecutor said, in full: 24 So, I'm going to give you a little background, just in the way to look at this case. With the principles that apply to criminal cases generally. It's kind of an interesting thing. Something that was pointed to me years ago. The arguments against the non-occurrence of a criminal act are limited to three. Three things. (a) It didn't happen. That's number one well, one. It didn't happen. There was no crime. No crime, in fact, occurred. Okay? For instance, the person you thought was dead, they turn up. The money you thought was stolen was just misplaced. So no crime occurred. The act itself didn't occur. Okay. Two, the act occurred, but there's an excuse, or a justification. Well I didn't hit first, it was self-defense. Or for instance, I'll tell you what, but for my role here today in this courtroom, this [ the prosecutor took the package of cocaine base that was marked as a government exhibit and placed the package under his suit jacket ] would be a criminal offense. But I have an excuse. This is my job. So, that's two of the explanations of why a crime hasn't occurred. Well, and then there's the third. And that's how we arrive here. The third is, well it happened, the crime happened. There's no excuse, no justification. But it wasn't me. So what you'll hear what you understand here is a defense of an argument, excuse me, of last resort, well because and I think counsel, and correct me if I'm wrong, it's your recollection that controls, counsel, in her opening said, well, there were drugs purchased that day, no question about that. And as far as I know, there's no excuse or justification present. These aren't prescription drugs. So, by a last resort, we arrive at, it wasn't me. Docket No. 81 at 15 16. Ford's counsel said, in full: 25 The truth in this case is that this Government wants to keep the truth from you. They wanted to keep the truth from you. They don't want you to know the real facts and the real truth. Do you remember when Corporal McEvoy was on the stand? The first question out of the box I asked him was, you arrested Mr. Ford, didn't you? Yeah. Did he have any drugs on him? Did he have any drug paraphernalia? Did he have large sums of money? Did he have anything on him at all? I don't remember. And before I asked McEvoy that, I asked the Government for a stipulation, can you stipulate that when you arrested my client, nothing on him but $37? Oh, no, we can't, we can't agree to that. So I ask the witnesses. Okay? McEvoy, at first he didn't recall, but then I think he did. And, of course, it's your recollection. And the truth is, the truth came out through Agent Wood. Thirty-seven dollars on him when they arrested him. No drugs. No drugs found in his home. No guns, no scales, nothing. Why didn't the Government want you to know that? Why did they try so hard to keep that from you? 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 25 \f U.S. v. Ford, 618 F.Supp.2d 368 (2009) Docket No. 81 at 31 32. 26 Ford's counsel argued (with some inaccuracy as to McKinley's testimony about whether he went inside the Midway Diner): I have to get up on cross-examination and ask them to play the tapes of Kevin McKinley's drug dealing, minutes before he meets Harold Ford at the Midway, with Martinez. And if you recall the Government, oh, we don't have those tapes, we can't play those. Oh, and we didn't bring them along. They brought them, and we eventually got them to play them for you. Remember that call at, I believe it was 11:49am on November the 10th, to Martinez? You heard it loud and clear. Half ounce of crack cocaine. Kevin McKinley wanted to get [crack] from Mr. Martinez, who I think there's testimony that they arrested him at some point, but they didn't see him that day. Half an ounce, loud and clear. In 40 minutes. It was 11:49 on November the 10th. Forty minutes later, Officer Farley told you, is just about when Kevin McKinley gets to the Midway. And goes inside the Midway. Officer Farley Sergeant Farley told you he went into the Midway. There's no officers in the Midway. The Government didn't play that tape for you, I had to play that tape for you. How about the next conversation? Minutes later, minutes before this supposed deal went down between Kevin McKinley and Harold Ford, another conversation, there's some unknown drug dealer. Well, you can't arrest an unknown can you? ... In those conversations, see, people, McKinley and the unknown and Martinez, they actually engaged in drug transactions. They discussed them. You heard them on the tapes. The Government didn't play that for you, they want to keep the truth from you, ladies and gentlemen. Docket No 81 at 32 34. Specifically, Ford's counsel said: 27 Do you recall how he recalled, with the greatest of precision imaginable, that on that day we left an undisclosed location and we turned southbound on 7th Street and northbound on Merchant and eastbound on Lincoln, and so and so, and at such a time I parked at the so and so and got McKinley and Ford were five to seven feet, this far apart, and I was located a block and a half away. A block being at least the size of this courtroom. And I saw this and I saw that. And I witnessed a handshake. And he remembered all of that with the greatest precision, he was very impressive at that time. Until cross-examination. And the first question out of the box was, do you recall when Mr. Ford was arrested? Did he have any drugs on him? Oh, I don't recall. You don't recall? What do you have, selective memory? You recall somebody walking eastbound on Merchant, or westbound on Lincoln Highway, and you don't recall whether the person who is the target of this whole thing who we're trying to prosecute here, you don't recall when you arrested him whether he had drugs on him? Come on. Do you have your own agenda? Maybe he's getting points for convicting people, because after all remember he told you, I was trying to show that he's a busy officer. Remember? Did you work five days a week? Oh, no I worked six days a week. Okay. And I think he was one of two narcotics officers in Coatesville. So he must have been very busy, I would assume. And this did happen two years ago. So when he realized where I was going, all of a sudden he told me he didn't witness it. Some weeks he didn't even witness a crime. Can you believe could you believe that? Do you really believe that, that he didn't witness any crimes? Docket No. 81 at 50 51. 28 The prosecutor said: I'd submit that you can infer that Mr. Ford was not locked up for a year, because it was an ongoing investigation. Kevin McKinley cooperated and made other buys. And if you lock someone up on the first day, the person who's the cooperator is useless for the rest of your activities. Instead, and I tried to follow this argument a little bit. And there were a lot of lawyer noises being made there, and I couldn't follow them all. And one of them said, why wasn't he locked up for a year? Because we didn't believe him. And I've been in this business for awhile. I want to hear that conversation, boss, we've been letting this sit out there for a year, we don't believe the guy, let's lock somebody up. Docket No. 81 at 64. 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 26 \f U.S. v. Ford, 618 F.Supp.2d 368 (2009) 29 30 31 32 33 These milder instances of vouching include the prosecutor's improper claim of authority I've been in this business for awhile that preceded an otherwise appropriate argument that the government would have little incentive to lock up Kevin McKinley. Docket No. 81 at 64 65. The prosecutor's vouching during rebuttal was also echoed in his appeal to facts outside the record in his initial closing argument when attempting to belittle the significance of Corporal McEvoy having been sued in connection with another investigation: And my colleague said, well, weren't you, the defense attorney and the Judge in your last drug case all sued? Docket No. 81 at 12. These remarks are particularly salient, as they immediately preceded the remarks in question and made clear that the prosecutor was invoking the government's good name as such, rather than offering a reasonable inference from the record about the government's integrity in this case. See Docket No. 81 at 57 58 ( Now, I'm the Government lawyer. I'm not getting rich. If a trial goes a week, I got to wear the same suit twice.... But when counsel says, the Government wants to keep the truth from you, well, as a lawyer, you don't have a whole lot, sometimes, but your good name and when you're accused personally-[.] ). In addressing Ford's claim that these statements constitute vouching, the government focuses on the prosecutor's statement that Corporal McEvoy was an honorable police officer doing honorable work. I agree that this statement, if it had stood alone, would have been an appropriate response to the defense's allegation that Corporal McEvoy had falsely testified to witnessing a handshake between Ford and Corporal McEvoy. See United States v. Weatherly, 525 F.3d 265, 271 72 (3d Cir.2008) (holding that, where the defense counsel accused testifying officers of perjury, the prosecutor could ask [w]hy would [the officers] risk their 32 34 years of experience on the police force over this case where the question called for an inference based upon evidence in the record ). But, in the case at bar, the prosecutor's gratuitous comments appear to accord McEvoy's testimony the imprimatur of government endorsement. The government does not appear to argue that the government's remarks were justified by the invited response doctrine. However, even if the government's brief could be construed to make this claim, I would not find the prosecutor's remarks so justified. Ford's challenge to the truthfulness of the government's witnesses and the forthrightness of the government's case was rooted in (1) the testimony of the government witnesses, (2) the existence of potentially exculpatory recordings of Kevin McKinley's conversations on November 10, and (3) the government's resistance to having those recordings played for the jury. The defense's argument was thus grounded in the evidence and was not articulated in markedly personal terms. See United States v. Weatherly, 525 F.3d 265, 272 (3d Cir.2008) ( It is permissible for counsel to argue inferences, but an inference must flow logically and convincingly from the facts in the record. ); see also Dispoz O Plastics, 172 F.3d at 285 ( We have generally found the invited response doctrine to be applicable only in instances where the prosecution team was attacked for reasons unsupported by the evidence at trial. ). As I instructed at the beginning of the government's rebuttal, the government was certainly entitled to address the defense's challenge to its candor, but it was not permitted to cast that argument in excessively personal terms. Reviewing the prosecutor's remarks in light of the trial record and based on my observations of the case, I find that the prosecutor's vouching was far in excess of any attack that was justified by the conduct of Ford's counsel. See United States v. Wood, 486 F.3d 781, 788 (3d Cir.2007) ( The invited response doctrine protects comments made in reasonable response to improper attacks by defense counsel.... But though a prosecutor may use the doctrine defensively, he may not do so offensively. ) (internal quotation marks omitted). I further note that the defense's closing argument, while aggressive in its attacks on the government, was a not-unwarranted response to the prosecutor's closing-argument characterizing the defense's trial strategy as one of last resort. The government argues that it was justified in accusing Ford's counsel of making something up, Docket No. 79 at 32, because she characterized McKinley as having led a lifetime of crime, including [r]obberies, stabbings, drugs, drugs, drugs, and more drugs, and carrying a gun, sticking up people, and terrorizing people with that gun. Docket No. 79 at 31 32. According to the government, this characterization of McKinley's criminal history bore no basis in fact (except for the drug trafficking, which was brought out by the government in it's [sic] opening statement.) Docket No. 89 at 29. However, while Ford's characterization of McKinley's criminal history was hyperbolic, and thus invited some response from the prosecutor, the statements were moored in fact. As addressed above, McKinley's lengthy criminal history included, in addition to numerous other firearm charges, a 2002 charge for making terroristic threats and 2003 convictions, pursuant to a guilty plea, for reckless endangerment and carrying an illegal firearm. The 2003 convictions were based on McKinley shooting into the window of an occupied vehicle. Docket No. 80 at 62 63. While the references by Ford's counsel to robberies, stabbings, and sticking up people were based on information that was ultimately 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 27 \f U.S. v. Ford, 618 F.Supp.2d 368 (2009) excluded from evidence, the information was not made up, but was drawn from a presentence investigation report of McKinley that defense counsel had received from the government just days before the trial. Thus, the prosecutor's allegation was one that was unsupported by the record evidence, Rivas, 493 F.3d at 139, and was an inappropriate response to Ford's opening argument. See United States v. Pelullo, 964 F.2d 193, 218 (3d Cir.1992) (stating that attorneys may not accuse each other of misconduct, such as subornation of perjury, unless there is a foundation in the record to support such charges ); see also Dispoz OPlastics, 172 F.3d at 285 ( We have generally found the invited response doctrine to be applicable only in instances where the prosecution team was attacked for reasons unsupported by the evidence at trial. ). Ford raises other claims which, if they were to be addressed, would be subject to plain error review. For example, Ford contends that the prosecutor improperly shifted the burden of proof to the defendant by categorizing Ford's arguments, under what the prosecutor characterized as principles that apply to criminal law generally, as a defense of ... last resort. Docket No. 81 at 15 16; see United States v. Balter, 91 F.3d 427, 441 (3d Cir.1996). ( [T]he prosecution ... may not improperly suggest that the defendant has the burden to produce evidence. ). Because I find that the jury's verdict must be set aside on other grounds, I will not reach these claims. Such an argument was not only inappropriate, it was false as a representation of the value of asserting a defense of misidentification. That innocent people are convicted of crimes they did not commit is not a new or a controversial proposition. See, e.g., Edwin Borchard, Convicting the Innocent: Sixty Five Actual Errors of Criminal Justice (1932) (detailing sixty-five cases of wrongful convictions); Hugo Adam Bedau and Michael L. Radelet, Miscarriages of Justice in Potentially Capital Cases, 40 Stan.

Before MORRIS SHEPPARD ARNOLD, McMILLIAN, and MELLOY, Circuit Judges. Opinion MELLOY, Circuit Judge. Xavier Holmes appeals his conviction by a jury of being a felon in possession of a firearm that had traveled in interstate commerce, in violation of 18 U.S.C. 922(g)(1). We reverse and remand for a new trial. I. Two police officers, Officer Snyder and Officer LeMoine, were dispatched to an apartment where Mr. Holmes and a gun were found after Brenda Williams (a sister of Mr. Holmes's girlfriend, Sheila Perry) called 911 and reported that there was a disturbance at the apartment involving a person armed with a gun. The door to the apartment was wide open when the officers arrived, and Brenda invited them inside. In addition to Brenda, Mr. Holmes and Ms. Perry were present in the apartment. The record is unclear as to what role, if any, Mr. Holmes played in the events leading to the 911 call. According to both officers' testimony, Mr. Holmes backed away from them with his hands behind his back when they entered the apartment, and Officer Snyder asked him to show his hands, but Mr. Holmes did not initially do so. Officer Snyder testified that he followed Mr. Holmes around a counter, after which Mr. Holmes backed up to a wall and began to pull a hand from behind his back as if he was picking something up from the back of his pants. Officer Snyder stated that he unholstered his gun in response to Mr. Holmes's actions, then began to point his gun at Mr. Holmes after observing that Mr. Holmes was holding a revolver. According to Officer Snyder, Mr. Holmes did not point the revolver at anyone, but rather slid it down his leg, let go of it, and it hit the floor. Officer Snyder was then assisted by Officer LeMoine in handcuffing Mr. Holmes. Officer LeMoine testified that she never saw Mr. Holmes holding or dropping a gun, and that she was focused on trying to defuse the argument between the two women in the apartment, but that at some point after Officer Snyder asked Mr. Holmes to show his hands, she heard a loud clunk like something had fallen onto the floor. The officers recovered the revolver from the floor after they detained Mr. Holmes. Mr. Holmes's testimony provided an alternative explanation for how the gun got on the floor. He testified that Carolyn Williams (a sister of Brenda and Ms. Perry), who had resided at the apartment where Mr. Holmes and the gun were discovered, had been incarcerated and asked him in a phone call to secure her furniture so nothing would happen to it. He explained that he had gone with Ms. Perry to Carolyn's apartment to retrieve the belongings, that Brenda was at the apartment when they arrived, and that Ms. Perry and Brenda got into an argument. He stated that after carrying a television set from the apartment to the car, he noticed police officers approaching the *773 apartment complex, and he went back into the apartment to get out of their way, as he had been drinking that day and didn't want them to smell it on [his] breath because he was on probation. Mr. Holmes testified that after he walked back into the apartment and was waiting for Ms. Perry to tell him what she wanted to move next, the next thing I know the police were there and I saw a gun laying on the counter, and I panicked and pushed it over the counter because I'm on probation and I'm not supposed to be around guns. He testified that he had no idea who owned the gun, and that the moment at which the police officers arrived was the first time I ever saw the gun. Both officers testified that they did not see the gun on the counter or see Mr. Holmes's hand making a motion towards the counter. 2015 Thomson Reuters.

[1] At trial, Mr. Holmes attempted to offer the testimony of Carolyn and two other witnesses whom he had subpoenaed, but the district court refused to allow them to testify, concluding that their testimony would be irrelevant. Prior to the close of his defense, Mr. Holmes asked the court to reconsider admitting the testimony of the three witnesses, but the court again declined to permit the testimony. Mr. Holmes contends that the exclusion of this testimony was erroneous and violated his due process right to present a defense. At trial, Mr. Holmes made offers of proof as to what the witnesses would have said: Carolyn would have testified that she was the leaseholder of the apartment, that her lease had expired, and that she had contacted Mr. Holmes about retrieving her property from the apartment; the apartment's landlord would have testified that Carolyn and her son had lived there and that their lease had ended shortly before the day of Mr. Holmes's arrest; and Carolyn's son would have testified that he was in the process of moving out of the apartment on the day that Mr. Holmes was arrested. Mr. Holmes maintained that he was offering the testimony to show why he was there, what he was doing, how he came to be there. The district court, however, responded that [u]nless one of them is going to say they put the gun on the counter, it's not relevant to this proceeding. [2] The district court's only stated rationale for excluding the testimony was that it was not relevant. We agree with Mr. Holmes that this was an improper basis for excluding the testimony. The excluded testimony was relevant because it provided background and contextual information that would have been useful in assessing the relative credibility of the officers' and Mr. Holmes's testimony. Cf. Old Chief v. United States, 519 U.S. 172, 186-89, 117 S.Ct. 644, 136 L.Ed.2d 574 (1997); United States v. DeAngelo, 13 F.3d 1228, 1232 (8th Cir.1994), cert. denied, 512 U.S. 1224, 114 S.Ct. 2717, 129 L.Ed.2d 842 (1994). Evidence is relevant so long as it has any tendency, however slight, to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence. Fed.R.Evid. 401; see United States v. Casares-Cardenas, 14 F.3d 1283, 1287 (8th Cir.1994), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 849, 115 S.Ct. 147, 130 L.Ed.2d 86 (1994). The threshold for relevance is quite minimal. United States v. Guerrero-Cortez, 110 F.3d 647, 652 (8th Cir.1997), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 1017, 118 S.Ct. 604, 139 L.Ed.2d 492 (1997). All relevant evidence is admissible, except as otherwise provided by the Constitution, legislation, or applicable evidentiary rules, and conversely, all irrelevant evidence is inadmissible. See Fed.R.Evid. 402. *774 The only disputed issue of material fact at trial was whether Mr. Holmes had knowingly possessed the firearm that the police officers recovered from the apartment. (The parties stipulated that Mr. Holmes was a convicted felon as of the date in question and that the gun had been transported in interstate commerce.) The jury was presented with two inconsistent accounts of how the events surrounding Mr. Holmes's arrest and the recovery of the gun unfolded. The government's theory that Mr. Holmes retrieved the gun from the back of his pants was supported by Officer Snyder's testimony that he had observed Mr. Holmes holding and dropping the gun that was found on the floor, and both officers' testimony that they had not observed a gun on the counter or Mr. Holmes's hand moving toward the counter. The jury had to determine whether this was sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Holmes had possessed the firearm despite Mr. Holmes's testimony to the contrary that he had merely pushed it from the counter upon observing it. The evidence proffered by Mr. Holmes was relevant because it would have made his explanation of how the gun came to be on the ground-that another person had placed it on the kitchen counter, and that he had pushed it away from him as the police entered the apartment-somewhat more plausible than it was without the evidence. Consequently, the evidence would have been of some value to Mr. Holmes in his efforts to create a reasonable doubt in the jurors' minds that he had possessed the gun. It would have corroborated his contention that he was present in the apartment to help the people who had lived there move, and it might have increased the probability that the apartment was in a state of disarray, that a firearm normally stored elsewhere had been left by somebody on the counter during the moving process, and that, as a guest in the apartment, he was surprised to discover the gun on the counter when the police arrived. It might also have tended to decrease the probability that he was personally armed by demonstrating that he was at the apartment for a legitimate nonviolent purpose rather than to pursue some nefarious goal. 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Serv. 804 [3] [T]he Constitution guarantees criminal defendants a meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense, which includes the right to present testimony of witnesses that is material and favorable to their defense and complies with the rules of evidence. See Crane v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 683, 690-91, 106 S.Ct. 2142, 90 L.Ed.2d 636 (1986) (internal quotations omitted); see also United States v. Turning Bear, 357 F.3d 730, 733 (8th Cir.2004). The testimony of these witnesses is relevant and therefore a part of Mr. Holmes's complete defense. Because we determine below that a retrial is necessary, we need not consider whether the exclusion of testimony was harmless. On retrial, these contested witnesses may offer their testimony. III. Mr. Holmes urges us to hold that improper [5] [4] comments made by the government during closing arguments deprived him of his fifth amendment right to a fair trial. The district court has broad discretion in controlling closing arguments, and we overturn a conviction on the basis of prosecutorial misconduct only upon a showing that improper remarks, in light of any rulings or curative instructions by the district court and in light of the trial as a whole, could reasonably have affected the jury's verdict. See United States v. Conrad, 320 F.3d 851, 855 (8th Cir.2003). If the government has made improper remarks to a jury, we determine whether *775 they deprived the defendant of a fair trial by examining the cumulative effect of such misconduct, the strength of the properly admitted evidence of the defendant's guilt, and the curative actions taken by the trial court. United States v. Hernandez, 779 F.2d 456, 460 (8th Cir.1985). Under this standard, we find that the cumulative effect of the remarks in this case, coupled with the exclusion of admissible testimony and the relative weakness of the government's case, could reasonably have affected the jury's verdict. [6] Mr. Holmes objected to a statement the government made at the beginning of its rebuttal argument: Mr. Moss is a good defense attorney, tries to get you to focus your attention over here when what really is important is right in front of you. It's all smoke and mirrors. (Mr. Moss was Mr. Holmes's trial counsel.) The district court overruled Mr. Holmes's objection that this comment was improper. The government continued to make similar comments about Mr. Moss later in its rebuttal argument, stating that Mr. Moss wants to distract you and tell you about all this other evidence that's not important, and that issues that Mr. Moss had raised about who had owned the gun in question were a red herring. The government also commented that Mr. Moss needs to make sure that they get their stories straight ( they presumably referred to Mr. Moss and Mr. Holmes), and that the jury should look at Mr. Moss's story. That's why I said he's got to get his stories straight. [7] We think that these various comments referring personally to Mr. Moss and the necessity for Mr. Moss to get his stories straight, taken as a whole and in the context of the rebuttal argument, show that the government attorney was accusing defense counsel of conspiring with the defendant to fabricate testimony. These types of statements are highly improper because they improperly encourage the jury to focus on the conduct and role of Mr. Holmes's attorney rather than on the evidence of Mr. Holmes's guilt. Such personal, unsubstantiated attacks on the character and ethics of opposing counsel have no place in the trial of any criminal or civil case. [8] More than thirty-five years ago our court found such statements to be improper. See Cline v. United States, 395 F.2d 138, 141 (8th Cir.1968) (finding it improper for a prosecutor to accuse defense counsel of dishonesty). Such statements are improper because a prosecutor's comment carries with it the imprimatur of the Government and may induce the jury to trust the Government's judgment rather than its own view of the evidence. United States v. Young, 470 U.S. 1, 18-19, 105 S.Ct. 1038, 84 L.Ed.2d 1 (1985). They are also improper because the role of the prosecutor is not merely to pursue convictions, but to pursue justice- the twofold aim of which is that guilt shall not escape or innocence suffer. Berger v. United States, 295 U.S. 78, 88, 55 S.Ct. 629, 79 L.Ed. 1314 (1935). In pursuit of these dual goals, a government attorney may prosecute with earnestness and vigor ... may strike hard blows ... [but] is not at liberty to strike foul ones. Id. Accordingly, prosecutors may not inject their own testimony nor cast aspersions upon the defendant through offhand comments, suggestions of conspiracy with defense counsel, nor personal attacks upon the integrity of defense counsel. See McDonnell v. United States, 457 F.2d 1049, 1052-53 (8th Cir.1972) (finding that a prosecutor deserved censure for admittedly describing defense counsel's 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Serv. 804 offer of proof as a common trick, but finding no abuse of discretion in the denial of a motion for mistrial because the judge and reporter had not *776 heard the remark and the court of appeals was unwilling to assume the jury had heard the remark); see also United States v. Pungitore, 910 F.2d 1084, 1142 (3d Cir.1990) (collecting cases); United States v. Murrah, 888 F.2d 24, 27 (5th Cir.1989) (reversing conviction because prosecutor improperly accused defense counsel of hiding expert witness to prevent government's use of witness); United States v. McLain, 823 F.2d 1457, 1462-63 (11th Cir.1987) (reversing conviction under plain error standard in part because prosecutor repeatedly stated that defense counsel intentionally misle[d] the jurors and witnesses and ... [lied] in court ), overruled on other grounds by United States v. Lane, 474 U.S. 438, 449, 106 S.Ct. 725, 88 L.Ed.2d 814 (1986) (as recognized in United States v. Watson, 866 F.2d 381, 385 n. 3 (1989)). It is particularly disturbing that the comments were made during the rebuttal phase of closing argument. See United States v. Cannon, 88 F.3d 1495, 1503 (8th Cir.1996) (reversing a conviction based on a prosecutor's improper remarks during closing and noting, Because the remark came during rebuttal arguments, defense counsel was unable to respond except by objection. ); United States v. Johnson, 968 F.2d 768, 772 (8th Cir.1992) (reversing a conviction based on prosecutor's improper comments during the rebuttal phase of closing arguments); see also United States v. Carter, 236 F.3d 777, 788 (6th Cir.2001) (improper comments during rebuttal constituted the last words from an attorney that were heard by the jury before deliberations ). In Cline, our court found an improper comment non-prejudicial specifically because the comment was an isolated remark ... made early in the trial. Cline, 395 F.2d at 142 (emphasis added). Here, in contrast, the prosecutor's improper comment came in the rebuttal phase of closing arguments. Defense counsel was left with no opportunity to rebut the allegations and the jury heard the remark immediately before deliberations. The potential for prejudice is great during closing arguments, especially when the defense has no opportunity for rebuttal. [9] The strength of the government's case, like the timing of improper comments, is also a factor relevant to our determination of prejudice. Cannon, 88 F.3d at 1503 ( [A]n improper argument is less likely to have affected the verdict in a case when the evidence is overwhelming than in a case where the evidence is weak. ); Johnson, 968 F.2d at 772 ( [T]he evidence of Johnson's guilt is far from overwhelming. ). Here, the government's case was less than overwhelming. This is a case where one police officer, Officer Snyder, presented a version of the facts that conflicted with the defendant's version of the facts. A second police officer, Officer Le Moine, offered testimony that could have supported either explanation. (She verified that she heard a clunk and saw the gun on the floor, but her failure to see Mr. Holmes move his hand towards the counter is easily explained by the fact that she was diffusing the argument between the two women and not looking at Mr. Holmes.) Further, when assessing the relative strength of the government's case and the potential for prejudice, we must consider the cumulative effect of the fact that relevant evidence favorable to the defendant was improperly excluded. As noted above, improper comments merit reversal if we find that those comments, in the context of the trial as a whole, could reasonably have affected the jury's verdict. Here the standard has been met. Because the government's case was not strong, witnesses offered by the defense were improperly excluded, the comments occurred during rebuttal arguments, *777 and the comments were of a highly prejudicial nature, we conclude that the defendant should be granted a new trial. 1 IV. [10] Mr. Holmes next contends that the district court erred by failing to give an instruction to the jury limiting the evidentiary use of his prior felony convictions. Rule 105 of the Federal Rules of Evidence provides that [w]hen evidence which is admissible ... for one purpose but not admissible ... for another purpose is admitted, the court, upon request, shall restrict the evidence to its proper scope and instruct the jury accordingly. In accordance with Rule 105, Mr. Holmes requested that the district court give an instruction that stated: You have heard evidence that the defendant Xavier Holmes was previously convicted of a crime. You may use that evidence only to help you decide whether to believe his testimony and how much weight to give it. That evidence does not mean 2015 Thomson Reuters.

This proposed instruction was taken verbatim from the Eighth Circuit's model jury instruction relating to impeachment of a defendant's testimony by a prior conviction. See Eighth Circuit Manual of Model Jury Instructions-Criminal, Instruction *778 2.16. The government opposed the use of Mr. Holmes's proposed instruction because it did not anticipate arguing any sort of propensity in this case, and because the instruction would confuse the jury since one of the elements of the crime charged was the fact that Mr. Holmes was a convicted felon. This was the only instruction on this matter that Mr. Holmes asked for, and the district court refused to give it. The district court did not err in declining to instruct the jury as Mr. Holmes requested because the proposed instruction was an erroneous statement of the law. One of the essential elements of the crime of being a felon in possession of a firearm is that the defendant has been convicted [of] a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year. 18 U.S.C. 922(g)(1). The evidence of Mr. Holmes's prior felony convictions was thus not only admissible to shed light on his credibility as a witness, it was substantive evidence that he had committed the charged offense. A direction that the jury must not use evidence of Mr. Holmes's previous felony convictions as proof of the crime charged in this case would simply have been wrong. VI. We reverse and remand for a new trial. MORRIS SHEPPARD ARNOLD, Circuit Judge, dissenting. I would not reverse this conviction based on the remarks that the government's counsel made during closing arguments. The court indulges every presumption against a benign construction of those remarks and its characterization of their purport is harsh. In my judgment, the statements objected to did not directly implicate defense counsel's honesty. I see no reason, moreover, to believe that the statements had a substantially injurious effect on the outcome of the case. Juries know that argument is not evidence; it is just talk. For all that we can know, the argument may well have gotten the jury's back up and prejudiced the government rather than the defendant. The court presumes that juries are a lot more impressionable than experience will allow for, and gives them too little credit for a common sense ability to discount vituperation and hyperbole and to restrict themselves to a consideration of the evidence adduced at trial. There is nothing in this case to differentiate it from the scores, perhaps hundreds of cases that have routinely come before us in the last thirty or forty years in which an identical argument has been rejected out of hand. This counsels more caution than the court employs in the present circumstances. V. I would uphold this judgment and therefore respectfully dissent. Mr. Holmes also raises a sentencing issue under Blakely v. Washington, 542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). In light of our remand order, we need not address this issue. Parallel Citations 67 Fed. R. Evid. Serv. 804 Footnotes 1 The government made two other potentially prejudicial comments. Taken in isolation, we believe that the district court adequately mitigated the impact of these other comments through its curative actions. Nevertheless, we strongly recommend that prosecutors not make such comments, and the cumulative effect of these comments added to the potential for prejudice in this case. 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 7 \f U.S. v. Holmes, 413 F.3d 770 (2005) 67 Fed. R. Evid. Serv. 804 Mr. Holmes objected during rebuttal argument when the government told the jury that to buy the defendant's story you have to believe that Officer Snyder and Officer LeMoine were lying. Mr. Holmes objected that this argument constituted impermissible burden shifting, and his objection was overruled. Though the testimony of the officers and Mr. Holmes were contradictory in important respects, and Mr. Holmes attacked the credibility of the officers as part of his defense, Mr. Holmes proposed the theory in his closing argument that the officers were merely mistaken in their perceptions based on the stress and intensity of the situation. The government's contention that Mr. Holmes's testimony about the gun could be believed only if both police officers were lying was, therefore, an incorrect characterization of the dispositive factual issue and of Mr. Holmes's theory of defense. Although the district court overruled Mr. Holmes's objection to the government's statement in this instance, the district court partially mitigated the impact of the statement by properly instructing the jury regarding the burden of proof. The government also argued to the jury that at the beginning of the trial [Mr. Holmes] is entitled to a presumption of innocence until evidence is presented. When he takes that stand, he's not presumed to be telling the truth. The district court sustained Mr. Holmes's objection that this line of argument was a misstatement of the law, stating during a bench conference that the government was crossing over the bounds, and that Mr. Holmes has the presumption of innocence until the jury finds he is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. At the end of the government's rebuttal argument, the district court properly instructed the jury that the defendant's presumption of innocence follows him throughout the trial and doesn't automatically go away when he gets on the witness stand and testifies. While the government's statement that a defendant who testifies is not presumed to be telling the truth was correct, the suggestion that the presumption of innocence in a criminal trial ceases to apply when the government presents evidence was misleading, and the district court thus appropriately sustained the objection and gave the curative instruction. The district court's actions undoubtedly helped to dispel any confusion or undo any prejudice that might have arisen as a result of the comment about the burden of proof.

Before MORRIS SHEPPARD ARNOLD, McMILLIAN, and MELLOY, Circuit Judges. Opinion MELLOY, Circuit Judge. Xavier Holmes appeals his conviction by a jury of being a felon in possession of a firearm that had traveled in interstate commerce, in violation of 18 U.S.C. 922(g)(1). We reverse and remand for a new trial. I. Two police officers, Officer Snyder and Officer LeMoine, were dispatched to an apartment where Mr. Holmes and a gun were found after Brenda Williams (a sister of Mr. Holmes's girlfriend, Sheila Perry) called 911 and reported that there was a disturbance at the apartment involving a person armed with a gun. The door to the apartment was wide open when the officers arrived, and Brenda invited them inside. In addition to Brenda, Mr. Holmes and Ms. Perry were present in the apartment. The record is unclear as to what role, if any, Mr. Holmes played in the events leading to the 911 call. According to both officers' testimony, Mr. Holmes backed away from them with his hands behind his back when they entered the apartment, and Officer Snyder asked him to show his hands, but Mr. Holmes did not initially do so. Officer Snyder testified that he followed Mr. Holmes around a counter, after which Mr. Holmes backed up to a wall and began to pull a hand from behind his back as if he was picking something up from the back of his pants. Officer Snyder stated that he unholstered his gun in response to Mr. Holmes's actions, then began to point his gun at Mr. Holmes after observing that Mr. Holmes was holding a revolver. According to Officer Snyder, Mr. Holmes did not point the revolver at anyone, but rather slid it down his leg, let go of it, and it hit the floor. Officer Snyder was then assisted by Officer LeMoine in handcuffing Mr. Holmes. Officer LeMoine testified that she never saw Mr. Holmes holding or dropping a gun, and that she was focused on trying to defuse the argument between the two women in the apartment, but that at some point after Officer Snyder asked Mr. Holmes to show his hands, she heard a loud clunk like something had fallen onto the floor. The officers recovered the revolver from the floor after they detained Mr. Holmes. Mr. Holmes's testimony provided an alternative explanation for how the gun got on the floor. He testified that Carolyn Williams (a sister of Brenda and Ms. Perry), who had resided at the apartment where Mr. Holmes and the gun were discovered, had been incarcerated and asked him in a phone call to secure her furniture so nothing would happen to it. He explained that he had gone with Ms. Perry to Carolyn's apartment to retrieve the belongings, that Brenda was at the apartment when they arrived, and that Ms. Perry and Brenda got into an argument. He stated that after carrying a television set from the apartment to the car, he noticed police officers approaching the *773 apartment complex, and he went back into the apartment to get out of their way, as he had been drinking that day and didn't want them to smell it on [his] breath because he was on probation. Mr. Holmes testified that after he walked back into the apartment and was waiting for Ms. Perry to tell him what she wanted to move next, the next thing I know the police were there and I saw a gun laying on the counter, and I panicked and pushed it over the counter because I'm on probation and I'm not supposed to be around guns. He testified that he had no idea who owned the gun, and that the moment at which the police officers arrived was the first time I ever saw the gun. Both officers testified that they did not see the gun on the counter or see Mr. Holmes's hand making a motion towards the counter. 2015 Thomson Reuters.

[1] At trial, Mr. Holmes attempted to offer the testimony of Carolyn and two other witnesses whom he had subpoenaed, but the district court refused to allow them to testify, concluding that their testimony would be irrelevant. Prior to the close of his defense, Mr. Holmes asked the court to reconsider admitting the testimony of the three witnesses, but the court again declined to permit the testimony. Mr. Holmes contends that the exclusion of this testimony was erroneous and violated his due process right to present a defense. At trial, Mr. Holmes made offers of proof as to what the witnesses would have said: Carolyn would have testified that she was the leaseholder of the apartment, that her lease had expired, and that she had contacted Mr. Holmes about retrieving her property from the apartment; the apartment's landlord would have testified that Carolyn and her son had lived there and that their lease had ended shortly before the day of Mr. Holmes's arrest; and Carolyn's son would have testified that he was in the process of moving out of the apartment on the day that Mr. Holmes was arrested. Mr. Holmes maintained that he was offering the testimony to show why he was there, what he was doing, how he came to be there. The district court, however, responded that [u]nless one of them is going to say they put the gun on the counter, it's not relevant to this proceeding. [2] The district court's only stated rationale for excluding the testimony was that it was not relevant. We agree with Mr. Holmes that this was an improper basis for excluding the testimony. The excluded testimony was relevant because it provided background and contextual information that would have been useful in assessing the relative credibility of the officers' and Mr. Holmes's testimony. Cf. Old Chief v. United States, 519 U.S. 172, 186-89, 117 S.Ct. 644, 136 L.Ed.2d 574 (1997); United States v. DeAngelo, 13 F.3d 1228, 1232 (8th Cir.1994), cert. denied, 512 U.S. 1224, 114 S.Ct. 2717, 129 L.Ed.2d 842 (1994). Evidence is relevant so long as it has any tendency, however slight, to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence. Fed.R.Evid. 401; see United States v. Casares-Cardenas, 14 F.3d 1283, 1287 (8th Cir.1994), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 849, 115 S.Ct. 147, 130 L.Ed.2d 86 (1994). The threshold for relevance is quite minimal. United States v. Guerrero-Cortez, 110 F.3d 647, 652 (8th Cir.1997), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 1017, 118 S.Ct. 604, 139 L.Ed.2d 492 (1997). All relevant evidence is admissible, except as otherwise provided by the Constitution, legislation, or applicable evidentiary rules, and conversely, all irrelevant evidence is inadmissible. See Fed.R.Evid. 402. *774 The only disputed issue of material fact at trial was whether Mr. Holmes had knowingly possessed the firearm that the police officers recovered from the apartment. (The parties stipulated that Mr. Holmes was a convicted felon as of the date in question and that the gun had been transported in interstate commerce.) The jury was presented with two inconsistent accounts of how the events surrounding Mr. Holmes's arrest and the recovery of the gun unfolded. The government's theory that Mr. Holmes retrieved the gun from the back of his pants was supported by Officer Snyder's testimony that he had observed Mr. Holmes holding and dropping the gun that was found on the floor, and both officers' testimony that they had not observed a gun on the counter or Mr. Holmes's hand moving toward the counter. The jury had to determine whether this was sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Holmes had possessed the firearm despite Mr. Holmes's testimony to the contrary that he had merely pushed it from the counter upon observing it. The evidence proffered by Mr. Holmes was relevant because it would have made his explanation of how the gun came to be on the ground-that another person had placed it on the kitchen counter, and that he had pushed it away from him as the police entered the apartment-somewhat more plausible than it was without the evidence. Consequently, the evidence would have been of some value to Mr. Holmes in his efforts to create a reasonable doubt in the jurors' minds that he had possessed the gun. It would have corroborated his contention that he was present in the apartment to help the people who had lived there move, and it might have increased the probability that the apartment was in a state of disarray, that a firearm normally stored elsewhere had been left by somebody on the counter during the moving process, and that, as a guest in the apartment, he was surprised to discover the gun on the counter when the police arrived. It might also have tended to decrease the probability that he was personally armed by demonstrating that he was at the apartment for a legitimate nonviolent purpose rather than to pursue some nefarious goal. 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Serv. 804 [3] [T]he Constitution guarantees criminal defendants a meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense, which includes the right to present testimony of witnesses that is material and favorable to their defense and complies with the rules of evidence. See Crane v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 683, 690-91, 106 S.Ct. 2142, 90 L.Ed.2d 636 (1986) (internal quotations omitted); see also United States v. Turning Bear, 357 F.3d 730, 733 (8th Cir.2004). The testimony of these witnesses is relevant and therefore a part of Mr. Holmes's complete defense. Because we determine below that a retrial is necessary, we need not consider whether the exclusion of testimony was harmless. On retrial, these contested witnesses may offer their testimony. III. Mr. Holmes urges us to hold that improper [5] [4] comments made by the government during closing arguments deprived him of his fifth amendment right to a fair trial. The district court has broad discretion in controlling closing arguments, and we overturn a conviction on the basis of prosecutorial misconduct only upon a showing that improper remarks, in light of any rulings or curative instructions by the district court and in light of the trial as a whole, could reasonably have affected the jury's verdict. See United States v. Conrad, 320 F.3d 851, 855 (8th Cir.2003). If the government has made improper remarks to a jury, we determine whether *775 they deprived the defendant of a fair trial by examining the cumulative effect of such misconduct, the strength of the properly admitted evidence of the defendant's guilt, and the curative actions taken by the trial court. United States v. Hernandez, 779 F.2d 456, 460 (8th Cir.1985). Under this standard, we find that the cumulative effect of the remarks in this case, coupled with the exclusion of admissible testimony and the relative weakness of the government's case, could reasonably have affected the jury's verdict. [6] Mr. Holmes objected to a statement the government made at the beginning of its rebuttal argument: Mr. Moss is a good defense attorney, tries to get you to focus your attention over here when what really is important is right in front of you. It's all smoke and mirrors. (Mr. Moss was Mr. Holmes's trial counsel.) The district court overruled Mr. Holmes's objection that this comment was improper. The government continued to make similar comments about Mr. Moss later in its rebuttal argument, stating that Mr. Moss wants to distract you and tell you about all this other evidence that's not important, and that issues that Mr. Moss had raised about who had owned the gun in question were a red herring. The government also commented that Mr. Moss needs to make sure that they get their stories straight ( they presumably referred to Mr. Moss and Mr. Holmes), and that the jury should look at Mr. Moss's story. That's why I said he's got to get his stories straight. [7] We think that these various comments referring personally to Mr. Moss and the necessity for Mr. Moss to get his stories straight, taken as a whole and in the context of the rebuttal argument, show that the government attorney was accusing defense counsel of conspiring with the defendant to fabricate testimony. These types of statements are highly improper because they improperly encourage the jury to focus on the conduct and role of Mr. Holmes's attorney rather than on the evidence of Mr. Holmes's guilt. Such personal, unsubstantiated attacks on the character and ethics of opposing counsel have no place in the trial of any criminal or civil case. [8] More than thirty-five years ago our court found such statements to be improper. See Cline v. United States, 395 F.2d 138, 141 (8th Cir.1968) (finding it improper for a prosecutor to accuse defense counsel of dishonesty). Such statements are improper because a prosecutor's comment carries with it the imprimatur of the Government and may induce the jury to trust the Government's judgment rather than its own view of the evidence. United States v. Young, 470 U.S. 1, 18-19, 105 S.Ct. 1038, 84 L.Ed.2d 1 (1985). They are also improper because the role of the prosecutor is not merely to pursue convictions, but to pursue justice- the twofold aim of which is that guilt shall not escape or innocence suffer. Berger v. United States, 295 U.S. 78, 88, 55 S.Ct. 629, 79 L.Ed. 1314 (1935). In pursuit of these dual goals, a government attorney may prosecute with earnestness and vigor ... may strike hard blows ... [but] is not at liberty to strike foul ones. Id. Accordingly, prosecutors may not inject their own testimony nor cast aspersions upon the defendant through offhand comments, suggestions of conspiracy with defense counsel, nor personal attacks upon the integrity of defense counsel. See McDonnell v. United States, 457 F.2d 1049, 1052-53 (8th Cir.1972) (finding that a prosecutor deserved censure for admittedly describing defense counsel's 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Serv. 804 offer of proof as a common trick, but finding no abuse of discretion in the denial of a motion for mistrial because the judge and reporter had not *776 heard the remark and the court of appeals was unwilling to assume the jury had heard the remark); see also United States v. Pungitore, 910 F.2d 1084, 1142 (3d Cir.1990) (collecting cases); United States v. Murrah, 888 F.2d 24, 27 (5th Cir.1989) (reversing conviction because prosecutor improperly accused defense counsel of hiding expert witness to prevent government's use of witness); United States v. McLain, 823 F.2d 1457, 1462-63 (11th Cir.1987) (reversing conviction under plain error standard in part because prosecutor repeatedly stated that defense counsel intentionally misle[d] the jurors and witnesses and ... [lied] in court ), overruled on other grounds by United States v. Lane, 474 U.S. 438, 449, 106 S.Ct. 725, 88 L.Ed.2d 814 (1986) (as recognized in United States v. Watson, 866 F.2d 381, 385 n. 3 (1989)). It is particularly disturbing that the comments were made during the rebuttal phase of closing argument. See United States v. Cannon, 88 F.3d 1495, 1503 (8th Cir.1996) (reversing a conviction based on a prosecutor's improper remarks during closing and noting, Because the remark came during rebuttal arguments, defense counsel was unable to respond except by objection. ); United States v. Johnson, 968 F.2d 768, 772 (8th Cir.1992) (reversing a conviction based on prosecutor's improper comments during the rebuttal phase of closing arguments); see also United States v. Carter, 236 F.3d 777, 788 (6th Cir.2001) (improper comments during rebuttal constituted the last words from an attorney that were heard by the jury before deliberations ). In Cline, our court found an improper comment non-prejudicial specifically because the comment was an isolated remark ... made early in the trial. Cline, 395 F.2d at 142 (emphasis added). Here, in contrast, the prosecutor's improper comment came in the rebuttal phase of closing arguments. Defense counsel was left with no opportunity to rebut the allegations and the jury heard the remark immediately before deliberations. The potential for prejudice is great during closing arguments, especially when the defense has no opportunity for rebuttal. [9] The strength of the government's case, like the timing of improper comments, is also a factor relevant to our determination of prejudice. Cannon, 88 F.3d at 1503 ( [A]n improper argument is less likely to have affected the verdict in a case when the evidence is overwhelming than in a case where the evidence is weak. ); Johnson, 968 F.2d at 772 ( [T]he evidence of Johnson's guilt is far from overwhelming. ). Here, the government's case was less than overwhelming. This is a case where one police officer, Officer Snyder, presented a version of the facts that conflicted with the defendant's version of the facts. A second police officer, Officer Le Moine, offered testimony that could have supported either explanation. (She verified that she heard a clunk and saw the gun on the floor, but her failure to see Mr. Holmes move his hand towards the counter is easily explained by the fact that she was diffusing the argument between the two women and not looking at Mr. Holmes.) Further, when assessing the relative strength of the government's case and the potential for prejudice, we must consider the cumulative effect of the fact that relevant evidence favorable to the defendant was improperly excluded. As noted above, improper comments merit reversal if we find that those comments, in the context of the trial as a whole, could reasonably have affected the jury's verdict. Here the standard has been met. Because the government's case was not strong, witnesses offered by the defense were improperly excluded, the comments occurred during rebuttal arguments, *777 and the comments were of a highly prejudicial nature, we conclude that the defendant should be granted a new trial. 1 IV. [10] Mr. Holmes next contends that the district court erred by failing to give an instruction to the jury limiting the evidentiary use of his prior felony convictions. Rule 105 of the Federal Rules of Evidence provides that [w]hen evidence which is admissible ... for one purpose but not admissible ... for another purpose is admitted, the court, upon request, shall restrict the evidence to its proper scope and instruct the jury accordingly. In accordance with Rule 105, Mr. Holmes requested that the district court give an instruction that stated: You have heard evidence that the defendant Xavier Holmes was previously convicted of a crime. You may use that evidence only to help you decide whether to believe his testimony and how much weight to give it. That evidence does not mean 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 6 \f U.S. v. Holmes, 413 F.3d 770 (2005) 67 Fed. R. Evid. Serv. 804 that he committed the crime charged here, and you must not use that evidence as proof of the crime charged in this case. This proposed instruction was taken verbatim from the Eighth Circuit's model jury instruction relating to impeachment of a defendant's testimony by a prior conviction. See Eighth Circuit Manual of Model Jury Instructions-Criminal, Instruction *778 2.16. The government opposed the use of Mr. Holmes's proposed instruction because it did not anticipate arguing any sort of propensity in this case, and because the instruction would confuse the jury since one of the elements of the crime charged was the fact that Mr. Holmes was a convicted felon. This was the only instruction on this matter that Mr. Holmes asked for, and the district court refused to give it. The district court did not err in declining to instruct the jury as Mr. Holmes requested because the proposed instruction was an erroneous statement of the law. One of the essential elements of the crime of being a felon in possession of a firearm is that the defendant has been convicted [of] a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year. 18 U.S.C. 922(g)(1). The evidence of Mr. Holmes's prior felony convictions was thus not only admissible to shed light on his credibility as a witness, it was substantive evidence that he had committed the charged offense. A direction that the jury must not use evidence of Mr. Holmes's previous felony convictions as proof of the crime charged in this case would simply have been wrong. VI. We reverse and remand for a new trial. MORRIS SHEPPARD ARNOLD, Circuit Judge, dissenting. I would not reverse this conviction based on the remarks that the government's counsel made during closing arguments. The court indulges every presumption against a benign construction of those remarks and its characterization of their purport is harsh. In my judgment, the statements objected to did not directly implicate defense counsel's honesty. I see no reason, moreover, to believe that the statements had a substantially injurious effect on the outcome of the case. Juries know that argument is not evidence; it is just talk. For all that we can know, the argument may well have gotten the jury's back up and prejudiced the government rather than the defendant. The court presumes that juries are a lot more impressionable than experience will allow for, and gives them too little credit for a common sense ability to discount vituperation and hyperbole and to restrict themselves to a consideration of the evidence adduced at trial. There is nothing in this case to differentiate it from the scores, perhaps hundreds of cases that have routinely come before us in the last thirty or forty years in which an identical argument has been rejected out of hand. This counsels more caution than the court employs in the present circumstances. V. I would uphold this judgment and therefore respectfully dissent. Mr. Holmes also raises a sentencing issue under Blakely v. Washington, 542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). In light of our remand order, we need not address this issue. Parallel Citations 67 Fed. R. Evid. Serv. 804 Footnotes 1 The government made two other potentially prejudicial comments. Taken in isolation, we believe that the district court adequately mitigated the impact of these other comments through its curative actions. Nevertheless, we strongly recommend that prosecutors not make such comments, and the cumulative effect of these comments added to the potential for prejudice in this case. 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 7 \f U.S. v. Holmes, 413 F.3d 770 (2005) 67 Fed. R. Evid. Serv. 804 Mr. Holmes objected during rebuttal argument when the government told the jury that to buy the defendant's story you have to believe that Officer Snyder and Officer LeMoine were lying. Mr. Holmes objected that this argument constituted impermissible burden shifting, and his objection was overruled. Though the testimony of the officers and Mr. Holmes were contradictory in important respects, and Mr. Holmes attacked the credibility of the officers as part of his defense, Mr. Holmes proposed the theory in his closing argument that the officers were merely mistaken in their perceptions based on the stress and intensity of the situation. The government's contention that Mr. Holmes's testimony about the gun could be believed only if both police officers were lying was, therefore, an incorrect characterization of the dispositive factual issue and of Mr. Holmes's theory of defense. Although the district court overruled Mr. Holmes's objection to the government's statement in this instance, the district court partially mitigated the impact of the statement by properly instructing the jury regarding the burden of proof. The government also argued to the jury that at the beginning of the trial [Mr. Holmes] is entitled to a presumption of innocence until evidence is presented. When he takes that stand, he's not presumed to be telling the truth. The district court sustained Mr. Holmes's objection that this line of argument was a misstatement of the law, stating during a bench conference that the government was crossing over the bounds, and that Mr. Holmes has the presumption of innocence until the jury finds he is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. At the end of the government's rebuttal argument, the district court properly instructed the jury that the defendant's presumption of innocence follows him throughout the trial and doesn't automatically go away when he gets on the witness stand and testifies. While the government's statement that a defendant who testifies is not presumed to be telling the truth was correct, the suggestion that the presumption of innocence in a criminal trial ceases to apply when the government presents evidence was misleading, and the district court thus appropriately sustained the objection and gave the curative instruction. The district court's actions undoubtedly helped to dispel any confusion or undo any prejudice that might have arisen as a result of the comment about the burden of proof.

Marshank and two co-defendants were indicted and charged with federal statutory violations related to their alleged membership in an organization which imported large amounts of hashish and marijuana into the United States. 1 Marshank brings this motion to dismiss the indictment against him, alleging that the United States government ( government ) violated his Sixth Amendment right to counsel and Fifth Amendment right to due process. Specifically, Marshank alleges that throughout the investigation of his case, his former attorney, 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 6 \f U.S. v. Marshank, 777 F.Supp. 1507 (1991) 60 USLW 2386 Ronald Minkin, had an ongoing relationship with government agents from various federal law enforcement agencies and the Assistant United States Attorneys ( AUSA ) assigned to his case. Marshank alleges that these agents and AUSAs, with full knowledge that Minkin was defendant's attorney, encouraged Minkin to actively aid the government's investigation of the defendant. Marshank further maintains that the government exploited the information they received from Minkin to arrest and prosecute him. This complicity, Marshank contends, occurred throughout the course of the investigation which led to a 1987 indictment of defendant, subsequently dismissed by the government, and continued during the investigation leading to the instant indictment. After reviewing the arguments and submissions of the parties, the court found that further evidence was necessary in order to rule on the motion to dismiss and held an evidentiary hearing pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 611. The following witnesses testified at the hearing: 1) Ronald Minkin, the defendant's former attorney; 2) Peter Robinson, the AUSA assigned to defendant's case in 1987; 3) Lee C. Rasmussen, an F.B.I. agent who worked in the narcotics unit of the Organized Crime Division in Los Angeles from 1982 through January 1990; 2 4) Edward Ames, a U.S. Customs agent in San Francisco; 5) Seth R. Booky, a former associate of Marshank who was indicted for drug trafficking in 1987; 3 6) Robert Heng, a special agent with the Drug Enforcement Administration; and 7) Wayne N. Yamashita, a special agent with the U.S. Customs Service in San Francisco. 4 In addition to the parties' moving papers and the testimony presented at the hearing, *1512 the agents submitted declarations. The government, pursuant to the court's discovery order, turned over numerous documents, including internal agency memoranda, agents' notes of meetings among themselves and with Minkin, and notes of telephone conversations between various agents and Minkin. FINDINGS OF FACT Taken together, the hearing testimony, the discovery material and the parties' moving papers tell the shocking tale of a criminal defense attorney who was oblivious to the professional norms of ethical behavior and a cast of overzealous government agents and prosecutors who facilitated the attorney's unethical conduct in an attempt to catch a big fish. Most of the facts are substantially undisputed; some of them are in sharp dispute. The following narrative embodies the court's findings of fact. The story began in 1986 when Ronald Minkin, a criminal defense attorney, approached AUSA James Walsh in Los Angeles on behalf of two clients, Gary Crawford and Gary Ohlgart. Although Crawford and Ohlgart had never been indicted and were not at that time under investigation, they wished to dissociate themselves from the drug business by providing information to the government in exchange for immunity from prosecution, complete anonymity and the promise that they would never have to testify in court. RT at 1 24. Minkin arranged a deal under these terms, on behalf of Crawford and Ohlgart, with AUSA James Walsh. Def.Ex. A. In August 1986 several agents, including F.B.I. agent Lee Rasmussen, debriefed Crawford and Ohlgart in Los Angeles. RT at 2 399. Minkin was present at this meeting. RT at 2 399 400. Crawford, Ohlgart and Minkin provided information about suspects in a major marijuana and hashish smuggling operation. RT at 2 402. Those suspects included several of Minkin's former and present clients, among them Stephen Marshank, Seth Booky, and Robert Wehe. Minkin's Los Angeles law firm had represented Marshank in a divorce proceeding in 1982 and 1983, Def.Ex. Z, and Minkin had personally represented Seth Booky on a drug-related charge in Hawaii in 1983. RT at 3 660. Both Marshank and Booky had ongoing attorney-client relationships with Minkin. Minkin, Crawford and Ohlgart made a diagram which sketched out the relationships among the various individuals they named. The defendant's name appeared on the chart, which came to be known as the matrix. Def.Ex. 1. On February 5 and 6, 1987, another meeting was held in Los Angeles. This meeting was attended by members of the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force ( OCDETF ), DEA agents, United States Customs agents from San Francisco and Los Angeles and three Assistant United States Attorneys. A task force was formed to develop a plan of action which would lead to the indictment of Booky, and then with Booky's cooperation, to the indictment of Marshank. The task force included various agents from Los Angeles and San Francisco, including Ames and Rasmussen. Def.Ex. P; RT at 2 416. It was determined at this meeting that because Crawford and Ohlgart had been promised that they would not have to testify, an inside individual would 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 7 \f U.S. v. Marshank, 777 F.Supp. 1507 (1991) 60 USLW 2386 be needed for the government to pursue the plan. RT at 2 404 05. The agents initially decided to target Robert Wehe, who was already the subject of a sealed indictment, for the inside individual role. RT at 2 405. Ron Minkin had represented Wehe in the past, id., and Wehe was chosen because Minkin told the agents that he [Minkin] could bring him in. RT at 2 412. Minkin contacted Wehe and mediated an agreement between Wehe and the government in which Wehe agreed to surrender and cooperate with the government. Def.Ex. D at 2. After his arrest while represented by Minkin, Wehe provided information about the defendant to the government. RT at 3 578. It eventually became apparent to the government that Wehe had a drinking problem which made him an unreliable active informant. RT at 2 420. The government then shifted its focus to Seth Booky, another of Minkin's former clients who had *1513 been named by Minkin, Crawford and Ohlgart. The plan was to indict Booky on a historical conspiracy charge. RT at 2 419. Booky would then cooperate with the government, wear a wire, make telephone calls and provide the necessary active work based upon the intelligence information provided by Crawford and Ohlgart. Def.Ex. P at 2. Marshank would be one of the major targets of the investigation. Def.Ex. P at 2; RT at 2 315, 2 425, 3 583. Minkin informed the government agents that he had represented Booky in Hawaii in 1983 and that Booky would be likely to cooperate. RT at 2 419 21. The plan to elicit Booky's cooperation in exchange for a plea agreement, RT at 2 421 22, changed in May 1987 when Minkin called Agent Ames and informed him that Booky was involved in a large marijuana deal. RT at 3 562. Ames testified that at the time he received the telephone call from Minkin he was aware that Minkin had represented Booky in the past. RT at 3 562. Based upon Minkin's information, AUSA Robinson authorized the arrest of Booky. On Memorial Day 1987, Agent Ames and the Sonoma County Sheriff's Department arrested nine individuals, including Booky, for the sale of one thousand five hundred pounds of marijuana. Ames Decl. at 6. Agent Ames never informed Booky that Minkin was the person who provided the government with the information leading to his arrest. RT at 3 565. Although there are some inconsistencies in the testimony of the various witnesses, it is clear that prior to Booky's arrest the government agents and the AUSAs on the case were aware that Minkin had represented Booky in the past and would probably represent him after he was arrested. AUSA Robinson, for example, stated that he understood from Ames that Minkin had represented Seth Booky in the past and would likely initially represent Booky after his arrest. Robinson Decl. 8. Booky himself had considered Minkin to be his attorney since 1983. RT at 3 686. The government also knew that Minkin had provided the information that led to Booky's arrest either directly or by relaying information from Crawford and Ohlgart. RT at 3 586. While AUSA Robinson denies that he knew at the time that the information leading to the arrest of Booky had been supplied by Booky's own lawyer, he concedes that he was aware that incriminating information concerning Booky had come from Crawford and Ohlgart, whom he knew were represented by Minkin. RT at 2 277. Robinson admits that he was aware that this situation represented a serious conflict of interest. RT at 2 278 79. Agent Ames testified that he told Robinson at the time of Booky's arrest that he [Ames] had received the information leading to Booky's arrest directly from Minkin. RT at 3 586. 5 After Booky's arrest, Robinson and Ames met with Booky in the Marin County Jail. The agents told him that they were willing to work out a deal whereby he would be awarded a percentage of the property forfeited as a result of his assistance. RT at 3 650 51. Booky contacted Minkin, who instructed his client in an extremely urgent way to cooperate with the government. RT at 3 652. 6 Minkin *1514 then negotiated a settlement of the case, including cooperation, with Robinson. RT at 2 274 75. Robinson never raised the issue of conflict of interest with Minkin or Booky during the plea negotiations although he was aware that Minkin's clients, Crawford and Ohlgart, acting under a cooperation agreement negotiated by Minkin, had provided the information leading to Booky's arrest. RT at 2 280. Nor did Robinson ever raise the issue of conflict of interest with the court. RT at 2 285. Subsequently, Booky entered into a representation agreement with Minkin which guaranteed Minkin one third of all 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 8 \f U.S. v. Marshank, 777 F.Supp. 1507 (1991) 60 USLW 2386 sums the government paid to Booky as a result of his cooperation. This included any monies Booky might receive for information leading to forfeiture of property. 7 Def.Ex.H. Although Minkin continued to represent Booky, Booky's attorney of record was Vincent Oliver, who rented space in Minkin's law office. Oliver acted as a front attorney. RT at 3 577. Both Robinson and Ames were aware that Minkin actually represented Booky. RT at 2 284, 3 577. The only court appearance Minkin made for Booky was at his sentencing on January 29, 1988. RT at 2 285. During the time between Booky's arrest on May 31, 1987 and Marshank's indictment on September 16, 1987, the task force investigation centered on Marshank and Daniel Hartog, who was suspected of running a large scale marijuana and hashish *1515 smuggling operation. With Minkin's assistance, the government used Booky to investigate both Hartog and Marshank. Booky was wired to record conversations with Marshank and engaged in other active work on the government's behalf. RT at 3 530. The government used Booky in this capacity, knowing full well that Booky's lawyer, Minkin, represented: 1) Crawford and Ohlgart, who had provided incriminating information about Booky and Marshank; 2) Bobby Wehe, who had provided incriminating information about Booky and Marshank; and 3) Booky himself, who was actively obtaining and providing incriminating information about Marshank. RT at 2 269, 3 530. In addition, Minkin told the government that he was likely to represent Marshank and that Marshank was likely to cooperate with the government. RT at 2 269. Booky eventually entered the Federal Witness Protection Program. Prior to that time the government's only access to Booky was through Minkin. Booky was hidden by Minkin and only Minkin knew his location. RT at 3 758. The government thus benefitted from Minkin's role as a conduit between Booky and the government agents and AUSAs. RT at 3 759. After Booky's arrest, the government agents believed that in order for Booky to remain a viable active informant, he would have to convince his confederates that he had not rolled over and was still fighting the prosecution of his case. Minkin, Booky and Agent Ames agreed that Booky should act as if he were not cooperating with the government and as if Minkin were defending him. RT at 3 569. During the summer of 1987 Booky began to put pressure on his confederates, including Marshank, to pay for his supposed defense and to provide him with living expenses. See Heng Decl., Exs. B, C, E. Marshank paid ten thousand dollars to Minkin for Booky's defense and expenses. RT at 3 596. Booky ostensibly requested the payment to convince his confederates that he had not become a government informant. RT at 3 576. The government was aware that Booky was pressuring Marshank for money to pay Minkin's fees. Booky had several phone conversations with Marshank in which he indicated that he needed money to pay Minkin for his defense. These phone conversations were recorded by the government. Heng Decl., Exs. C at 5 8, Ex. E. Agent Ames testified that he told Robinson about the payment of money by Marshank to Minkin, RT at 3 587 88, 3 598, and that Robinson must have been aware of the payments because in the summer of 1987 he was the AUSA on the case and was aware of the contents of the taped Booky phone conversations. RT at 3 528. 8 The government, however, allowed both Booky and Minkin to keep the money. None of the money paid to Booky and Minkin was ever seized. RT at 3 596 98. The government subsequently used the payment of Minkin's fees as evidence against Marshank in the second grand jury proceeding against him. RT 3 673. During the time between Booky's arrest and the defendant's indictment, Booky received over twenty thousand dollars from various sources. RT at 3 645. Minkin received ten thousand dollars from Marshank for Booky's ostensible defense. Grand Jury Proceedings, Testimony of Ronald Minkin, June 28, 1990, at 27 28. Minkin testified that he gave half of that sum to Oliver and returned the other half to Booky for living expenses. RT at 1 186. In the summer of 1987 it became clear to the government that Booky was suspected by his confederates. Booky reported that he was finding it difficult to get close to Hartog. RT at 3 677. Robinson, Ames and Yamashita decided to use the information provided by Booky and Minkin to indict Marshank on a historical conspiracy charge in the hopes that Marshank would then *1516 provide information about a thirty-five ton shipment of marijuana, known as the Hartog Load , that was allegedly being shipped from Thailand.

Marshank, 777 F.Supp. 1507 (1991) 60 USLW 2386 During the 1987 pre-indictment investigation of Marshank, then AUSA Robinson knew that Minkin was representing Marshank. RT at 2 269, 2 323 24. Robinson also knew that Minkin had told Agent Ames that Marshank would probably cooperate with the government because Minkin had been Marshank's lawyer previously. RT at 2 328, 2 350. In addition, Robinson was aware that the government would use information from Minkin's other clients to indict Marshank. RT at 2 333. Minkin's role, assigned to him by the government, was to encourage and bring about Marshank's cooperation. RT at 2 324. After the decision was made to indict and arrest Marshank, the grand jury heard testimony from several witnesses. All of the witnesses who provided testimony against Marshank were clients of Ron Minkin. RT at 2 272. The grand jury witnesses were Seth Booky, Robert Wehe, and a government agent who summarized a statement taken from David Vandrell, another of Minkin's clients. RT at 2 270, 2 352. Although the government was ready to arrest Marshank following his indictment on September 16, 1987, his whereabouts were unknown. RT at 3 535. Agent Ames called Agent Rasmussen, who gave Minkin's telephone number to Ames. RT at 2 496. Ames then phoned Minkin. Minkin made inquiries to determine where Marshank was, RT 1 61 62, informed Ames that the defendant was in Florida, and provided the agent with Marshank's exact location. RT at 3 535. Acting upon the information provided by Minkin, Ames flew to Florida, found Marshank and arrested him on October 2, 1987. RT at 3 536. By the time of the defendant's arrest, Agent Ames and AUSA Robinson knew that Minkin was representing Booky, RT at 3 527, and that Booky and Minkin had provided the government with the information leading to Marshank's arrest. RT at 3 528. Agent Ames stated that after he arrested Marshank he read the defendant his Miranda rights and then suggested that he call legal counsel. Ames provided Marshank with a telephone to make the call. Ames Decl. 9:16 21; RT at 3 536 38. Agent Yamashita testified that it is highly unusual for a government agent to suggest that a suspect contact legal counsel upon making an arrest and that the standard procedure for Customs agents is to avoid any mention of attorneys after suspects are given the Miranda warning so as not to damage the possibility of obtaining an interview with the suspect. RT at 3 723 24. This, obviously, was not a concern of Agent Ames in this case. As expected, Marshank called Minkin. RT at 3 537. Minkin flew to Florida to represent Marshank. RT at 3 538; Def.Ex. L. Agent Rasmussen testified that both Ames and Minkin called him either from Florida or immediately before they went to Florida; thus, Minkin conferred with the government before meeting with his client. RT at 2 441. By this time Rasmussen was aware that Minkin represented Booky, RT at 2 444, and that Minkin was going to Florida on business involving Marshank. Id. In Florida, Agent Ames met first with Minkin and then with Minkin and Marshank. RT at 3 530 31. Ames never informed Marshank that Minkin had provided the government with information concerning Marshank's whereabouts or that Minkin and his clients had supplied the government with the information that led to Marshank's indictment and arrest. RT at 3 553 54. The meeting between Ames, Minkin and Marshank was off the record for the most part. Minkin, however, did recommend to the defendant that he disclose on the record the existence of two false passports. RT at 3 532. Minkin told Ames that he would put the passport discussion on the record as a sign of good faith. Ames Decl. at 11. At a bail hearing the following week, Marshank's admission was used by the government to argue for detention of the defendant without bail. RT at 3 532. Ames had no knowledge of *1517 the passports before learning about them from Minkin. RT at 3 590. Agent Ames had concerns about Minkin's ability to represent Marshank in light of their potential conflict of interest. RT at 3 524 25. The agent testified that before interviewing Marshank he called Robinson from Florida and expressed his concern about Minkin acting as the defendant's lawyer. RT at 2 526. Ames testified that Robinson told him to proceed with the arrest and to bring Marshank back to San Francisco. Robinson said they would sort it out later, RT at 3 526 27, and did not instruct Ames to raise the issue of conflict of interest with the court, the U.S. Attorney in Florida, or with Minkin himself. 9 Ames never informed Marshank or the court of the potential conflict of interest.

Marshank, 777 F.Supp. 1507 (1991) 60 USLW 2386 Contrary to Minkin's predictions, Marshank refused to cooperate with the government following his arrest. After Marshank's arrest Minkin spoke with DEA Agent Heng. Agent Heng testified that Minkin was disappointed that his client had refused to cooperate. RT at 3 823. Minkin complained that his client was crying hysterically and that, rather than taking advantage of Marshank's state, Agent Ames had dropped the ball by putting the defendant back in jail. Def.Ex. Y; RT at 3 796, 3 823. In addition, Minkin lamented to Robinson that Agent Ames blew it because the agent was not heavy enough with Marshank. RT at 2 358 59. Agent Ames flew with Marshank from Florida to California. RT at 3 557. During the trip Ames had conversations with Marshank about substantive matters related to Marshank's case, even though the agent was aware that Marshank was represented by counsel. RT at 3 557 60. After Marshank was returned to San Francisco, he dismissed Minkin and retained his current counsel. Marshank's ex-wife, Jane Wechsler, stated that she called Minkin on October 6, 1987, after learning of Marshank's arrest, to see if she could be of any help. In her sworn declaration, Wechsler recounted that Minkin claimed he was the only person who could handle Steven's case, that if Steven knew what was best he would keep Minkin as his lawyer and would cooperate with the government one hundred percent. Wechsler Aff. 6. Minkin also allegedly told Wechsler that Marshank would have to pay Minkin one million dollars and that federal agents would see to it that Marshank was able to obtain money from foreign bank accounts. Wechsler Aff. 8, 9. In addition, Wechsler contends that Minkin suggested that it would be helpful for government agents to arrest Julie Aldwell, a friend of Marshank's with whom he was purportedly involved in drug smuggling. Wechsler Aff. 18. Minkin allegedly told Wechsler that Aldwell's arrest would help Marshank come to his senses, since Aldwell would be forced to inform on Marshank in order to save herself and Marshank would then feel the noose tightening around his neck. Id. Minkin maintained contact with government agents and provided them with substantive evidence against Marshank. The agents often took notes of their telephone conversations with Minkin. See Def.Ex. O and Y. Minkin often called the agents to give them information on Marshank's activities. 10 Def.Ex. Y. For example, Minkin provided information about Marshank to *1518 Agents Ames and Yamashita on numerous occasions in the months prior to Marshank's arrest in October 1987. RT at 3 583, 3 599, 3 720 3 742. In August 1987 Minkin met with Ames and Yamashita to help the agents decipher the matrix previously provided by Minkin, Crawford and Ohlgart and to provide the government with additional information. RT at 3 717 18. Yamashita's notes dated October 9, 1987, one week after Marshank was arrested in Florida, indicate that Minkin called Yamashita and gave him the location of Deborah Hawkins, a witness the government was looking for in the Marshank case. Def.Ex. Y; RT at 3 743. An undated note indicates that Minkin called Yamashita and gave him the name of somebody with whom Marshank allegedly distributed cocaine. Def.Ex. Y; RT at 3 762. On yet another occasion, Minkin called Yamashita and gave the agent the name of an individual who was willing to provide the government with incriminating information concerning Marshank. RT at 3 760. Agent Heng testified that he had at least fifteen discussions with Minkin after the attorney was fired by Marshank. RT at 3 792. During at least some of these conversations, Minkin provided Heng with information concerning Marshank. RT at 3 792. In November 1987, FBI Agent Rasmussen met with AUSA Zanides, who had taken over the Marshank case from Peter Robinson. RT at 2 445. Zanides informed Rasmussen that he was going to dismiss the 1987 indictment against Marshank. The AUSA believed that the evidence gathered was insufficient to result in a conviction at trial and believed that Marshank had been undercharged. RT at 2 445 46; Gov. In Camera Submission, Ex. II. In a November 25, 1987 memorandum to then U.S. Attorney Joseph Russoniello ( Zanides Memorandum ), Zanides explained that the reason the case had been brought so early was because it was expected that Marshank would cooperate and provide information about the thirty-five ton Hartog load. Gov. In Camera Submission, Ex. II at 2. While Zanides dismissed the 1987 indictment, it was his intention to re-indict Marshank after further investigation. RT at 2 446.

Minkin testified at the June 28, 1990 grand jury proceedings leading to the instant indictment against Marshank. In fact, Minkin did not stop providing information to the government about Marshank until after the motion to dismiss at issue here was filed and AUSA Howden, the most recent prosecutor assigned to the case, instructed government agents not to have any more contact with the defendant's former attorney. RT at 2 477, 3 810. DISCUSSION The defendant argues that the indictment against him must be dismissed because the government engaged in prosecutorial misconduct which violated his Fifth Amendment right to due process and Sixth Amendment right to assistance of counsel. While application of the Sixth Amendment is [2] I. Fifth Amendment [1] limited to government action which occurs after the initiation of adverse criminal proceedings, a defendant's remedy for prosecutorial misconduct in the pre-indictment stage is provided in the due process protections of the Fifth Amendment. United States v. Marion, 404 U.S. 307, 315, 92 S.Ct. 455, 460, 30 L.Ed.2d 468 (1971); United States v. Simmons, 536 F.2d 827, 830 n. 9 (9th Cir.1976). Depending *1519 on when it occurs, government misconduct which subverts a defendant's relationship with his client may be judged under the standards of both the Fifth and the Sixth Amendments. A Fifth Amendment due process violation may occur when government interference in an attorney-client relationship results in ineffective assistance of counsel or when the government engages in outrageous misconduct. A. Ineffective Assistance Of Counsel is rendered [3] When the government interferes in a defendant's relationship with his attorney to the degree that counsel's assistance the government's misconduct may violate the defendant's Fifth Amendment right to due process as well as his Sixth Amendment right to counsel. United States v. Irwin, 612 F.2d 1182, 1185 (9th Cir.1980). ineffective, [5] Prosecutorial misconduct constitutes a due [4] process violation under Irwin only where the defendant has been prejudiced. Id. at 1187. The power to dismiss an indictment on due process grounds on the basis of prosecutorial misconduct should be exercised sparingly. United States v. Busher, 817 F.2d 1409, 1411 (9th Cir.1987). Sparing use, of course, does not mean no use. Even disfavored remedies' must be used in certain situations. United States v. Omni Int'l Corp., 634 F.Supp. 1414, 1438 (D.Md.1986) (citation omitted). [7] The government contends that it did nothing wrong [6] and that the blame for any misconduct lies solely with Minkin. This court cannot agree. The government collaborated with Marshank's attorney to build a case against him, to effect his arrest, and to ensure that he would cooperate with the government rather than contest the charges against him. Marshank was first identified as a prospective target for criminal investigation as a result of information provided to the government by Minkin and two of his other clients. The government then actively worked with Minkin to develop a case against Marshank. 11 Government agents and AUSA Robinson used information supplied by Minkin to arrest Seth Booky, even though the government knew that Minkin had previously represented Booky and would most likely represent him on the charges which arose from Minkin's collaboration with the government. The government then used Booky as an informant to assist in the investigation of Marshank, despite the fact that the government was aware that Minkin had previously represented Marshank and would most likely represent him if he was charged with a crime as a result of the investigation in which Minkin and Booky participated. The government's decision to use Ron Minkin and Minkin's clients to develop a case against Steven Marshank created a conflict of interest between Minkin and Marshank. The 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 12 \f U.S. v. Marshank, 777 F.Supp. 1507 (1991) 60 USLW 2386 government was aware of this conflict and took advantage of it. The government did nothing to alert either the court or the defendant to the conflict of interest. It did nothing to alert Minkin, who was apparently oblivious, to any conflict. While the government may have no obligation to caution defense counsel against straying from the ethical path, it is not entitled to take advantage of conflicts of interest of which the defendant and the court are unaware. *1520 In this case, the government went so far as to participate in efforts to mask the conflict of interest from the defendant. The government was aware that Booky and Minkin solicited funds from Marshank and his associates, ostensibly to pay Booky's legal fees. Government agents taped and reviewed numerous conversations between Booky, Marshank and Marshank's associates discussing the legal fees needed for Booky's defense. Knowing that no defense was being mounted and that the legal fees were obtained by Minkin under false pretenses, the government did not seize the funds transferred from Marshank and his associates to Booky and Minkin, but allowed Minkin and his client to keep the money. Had Marshank been aware of Booky's decision to cooperate with the government, the defendant would have been alerted to Minkin's conflict of interest. Even after the defendant's arrest, the government did nothing to advise him of the conflict. Instead, the government colluded in the effort to hide the relationship between Minkin, Booky and the government by failing to inform Marshank of his attorney's role in his investigation. Worse yet, the record makes clear that the government plotted with Minkin to ensure Marshank's arrest and then steered Marshank in Minkin's direction to guarantee his cooperation. After obtaining the indictment against Marshank, Agent Ames called Minkin, who informed the government of Marshank's whereabouts. Ames then went to Florida to arrest Marshank. Minkin consulted with Agent Rasmussen after Marshank's arrest but before speaking with his client. Upon arresting Marshank, Agent Ames departed from standard procedure and encouraged Marshank to call a lawyer, knowing that the lawyer he contacted would be Minkin, that Minkin had provided the government with the information leading to Marshank's arrest, and that Minkin would do everything in his power to deliver Marshank's cooperation to the government. Although Agent Ames expressed concern to AUSA Robinson about the conflict of interest between Marshank and Minkin, neither the agent nor the prosecutor ever made Marshank or the court aware of this conflict. In light of the astonishing facts of this case, it is beyond question that Minkin's representation of Marshank was rendered completely ineffectual and that the government was a knowing participant in the circumstances that made the representation ineffectual. Minkin essentially turned Marshank over to the government in an effort to force him to cooperate. Indeed, as a result of the retainer agreement between Minkin and Booky, Minkin stood to gain millions of dollars if Marshank's property was seized as a result of his prosecution. Minkin's conduct during the post-arrest meeting between Marshank and the government suggests that he was attempting to worsen Marshank's position vis- a-vis the government in order to ensure that Marshank would cooperate. In this regard, Minkin advised Marshank to provide Agent Ames with incriminating information on the record and with no protection as a sign of good faith. It is clear to the court that Minkin's primary interest was to convince Marshank to cooperate with the government. After Marshank's arrest, Minkin attempted to engage the defendant's former wife in a scheme to tighten the noose around Marshank's neck and to persuade him to cooperate. When Marshank refused to cooperate, Minkin complained to Agent Rasmussen that Agent Ames had dropped the ball by not being heavy enough with Marshank. The government's knowledge that Minkin would attempt to induce Marshank to cooperate affected the timing of the first indictment. In a November 25, 1987 memo to then U.S. Attorney Joseph Russoniello, AUSA Mark Zanides, who took over the Marshank case from AUSA Robinson, recommended that the first indictment against Marshank be dismissed without prejudice because the evidence gathered was insufficient. Gov. In Camera Submission, Ex. II. In attempting to explain why the indictment had been sought and the defendant arrested in light of the weak case against him, Zanides observed that certain investigative *1521 steps necessary to corroborate a historical drug conspiracy were not undertaken, in part because the government expected that Marshank, when arrested, would cooperate with the government. Id. The government chose to indict and arrest Marshank without sufficient evidence to convict him because they believed that Minkin could ensure Marshank's cooperation. With the defendant's attorney in the government 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 13 \f U.S. v. Marshank, 777 F.Supp. 1507 (1991) 60 USLW 2386 camp, the strength of the government's case against Marshank became irrelevant. Under Irwin and Horowitz, interference with the attorney- client relationship is not enough, in and of itself, to constitute a due process violation. There must also be prejudice to the defendant. Irwin, 612 F.2d at 1187. Prejudice may manifest itself in a number of ways, including use of evidence gained through the interference, use by the prosecution of confidential information regarding defense plans and strategy, or destruction of the attorney-client relationship. Id. Prejudice may also result from other actions designed to give the prosecution an unfair advantage at trial. Id. It is clear that Marshank was prejudiced by the government misconduct in this case. First, the facts strongly suggest that, absent the government's improper interference with the relationship between Minkin and his clients, there would not have been any indictments against Marshank. Minkin, along with his clients Crawford and Ohlgart, identified Marshank to the government and were thus responsible for his becoming the target of criminal investigation in the first instance. Minkin and his client Seth Booky were instrumental in the pre-indictment investigation of Marshank. During the proceedings before the first grand jury, all three of the witnesses presenting testimony Seth Booky, Robert Wehe, and David Vandell were clients of Ron Minkin. Minkin and his clients were also integrally involved in the investigation which resulted in the instant indictment against the defendant. Minkin provided information to the government concerning Marshank on a consistent basis and testified against Marshank during the 1990 grand jury proceedings. Marshank was also prejudiced in numerous other ways. Evidence obtained through government misconduct was used against Marshank at every turn. The testimony of three of Minkin's clients before the grand jury demonstrates beyond question that the government marshalled the evidence provided by Minkin and his clients to obtain the first indictment. Minkin's cooperation with the government throughout the investigation leading to the instant indictment, his testimony against Marshank before the second grand jury, and the prominence of Seth Booky in the second indictment all lead inexorably to the conclusion that evidence obtained through government misconduct was used to obtain the second indictment against the defendant. It is also apparent that the government's misconduct in this case was designed to and would give the prosecution an unfair advantage at trial. The court need not retrace the source of the government's evidence against Marshank, other than to say that most, if not all of it, appears to have come directly or indirectly from Ron Minkin. Moreover, while he was in custody Marshank believed that he was being represented by counsel who was uncompromised. In fact, however, Marshank's attorney was in league with the government. Marshank was, for all intents and purposes, unrepresented during his post-arrest meetings with the government. The government took advantage of this situation to obtain incriminating information from Marshank and to engage in post-indictment, post-arrest communications with Marshank outside the presence of counsel. [9] Having found a Fifth Amendment violation under [8] Irwin, the court must decide the appropriate remedy. In making this determination, the court must tailor the remedy to the injury. United States v. Rogers, 751 F.2d 1074, 1078 (9th Cir.1985). The appropriate remedy for a Fifth Amendment violation is generally suppression of the evidence. Rogers, 751 F.2d at 1078. However, dismissal of the indictment is appropriate where continuing prejudice from *1522 the constitutional violation cannot be remedied by suppression of the evidence. United States v. Morrison, 449 U.S. 361, 365 66 n. 2, 101 S.Ct. 665, 669 n. 2, 66 L.Ed.2d 564 (1981); Rogers, 751 F.2d at 1078. [10] Suppression is an appropriate remedy where the court can identify and isolate the evidence obtained in violation of the defendant's Fifth Amendment due process rights. The prosecution is thus denied the fruits of its transgression and the due process right to a fair trial is preserved. Rogers, 751 F.2d at 1078. In the case at bar, however, the fruit of the prosecutor's transgression is the indictment itself. In such a situation, it is simply impossible to excise the taint of the government's constitutional transgressions from the prosecution of the defendant. The taint of the government's transgressions spreads to all the evidence obtained against Marshank. [11] Because of the bizarre circumstances surrounding the investigation and prosecution of the defendant, it is not surprising that neither the parties nor the court has been able to find case law based on facts similar to those found here. However, United States v. Schell, 775 F.2d 559 (4th 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 14 \f U.S. v. Marshank, 777 F.Supp. 1507 (1991) 60 USLW 2386 Cir.1985), cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1098, 106 S.Ct. 1498, 89 L.Ed.2d 898 (1986), is persuasive as to the appropriate remedy. In Schell, Jividen, a criminal defense attorney, briefly represented Wilson and Cain, both of whom had been subpoenaed to testify before a grand jury investigating the Gallo drug organization. Several months later, Jividen was hired as an Assistant U.S. Attorney. Jividen informed the U.S. Attorney of his previous representation of Wilson and Cain, and as a result Jividen was not allowed to participate in any way in the gathering of evidence against or prosecution of his former clients. Schell, 775 F.2d at 563. However, in his capacity as Assistant U.S. Attorney, Jividen appeared in front of a different grand jury investigating the Gallo drug organization. Jividen's former clients testified before one grand jury and Jividen appeared before another one. Schell, 775 F.2d at 563 n. 2. Wilson and Cain were subsequently indicted along with numerous other alleged members of the drug organization. Both defendants moved to dismiss their indictments on the grounds that Jividen's participation in the grand jury proceeding violated their due process rights. In Schell the government argued that it had engaged in no impropriety, pointing out that Jividen's participation had been limited to prosecution of other members of the drug organization and that the AUSA had been excluded from work on the cases against Wilson and Cain. The prosecution further maintained that Jividen did not possess any confidential information with respect to his former clients. Rejecting the government's argument, the court observed: Assuming that all of the government's assertions are true, the fact remains that Jividen represented Wilson and Cain with respect to the very same criminal activity which led to the indictment that he ultimately helped to prosecute and under which Wilson and Cain were convicted. Schell, 775 F.2d at 565. The court then dismissed the indictments against Wilson and Cain, holding that due process is violated when an attorney represents a client and then participates in the prosecution of that client with respect to the same matter. Schell, 775 F.2d at 566. While Ron Minkin was never hired by the U.S. Attorney's office he participated in the prosecution of his own client far more than did the attorney in Schell. The government in this case not only took no precautions to separate Minkin's work with the government from the investigation and prosecution of the defendant, but relied on Minkin to build a case against the defendant. As the Schell court pointed out: joins in lawyer The relationship between an attorney and his client is a sacred one. In that relationship, the client must be secure in the knowledge that any information he reveals to counsel will remain confidential. The confidentiality of the attorney-client relationship is severely compromised, if not destroyed, when, after representing a client, a the criminal *1523 prosecution of that client with respect to the identical matter about which the attorney originally counseled the client. Such switching of sides is fundamentally unfair and inherently prejudicial. Without question, the client's right to a fair trial, secured by the due process clauses of the fifth and fourteenth amendments, is compromised under these circumstances. Schell, 775 F.2d at 565. In this case, even more than in Schell, the defendant's due process right to a fair trial has been compromised by the government's interference in the attorney-client relationship. As discussed above, the taint of the government's constitutional transgression infected every part of the investigation and prosecution of the defendant. There is no means other than dismissal of the indictment to remedy the due process violation which occurred. Morrison, 449 U.S. at 366 n. 2, 101 S.Ct. at 668 n. 2; Rogers, 751 F.2d at 1078. The indictment is, therefore, DISMISSED. B. Outrageous Government Misconduct [12] A court may also dismiss an indictment when the conduct of law enforcement agents is so outrageous that due 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 15 \f U.S. v. Marshank, 777 F.Supp. 1507 (1991) 60 USLW 2386 process principles would absolutely bar the government from invoking judicial processes to obtain a conviction, ... United States v. Russell, 411 U.S. 423, 431 32, 93 S.Ct. 1637, 1643, 36 L.Ed.2d 366 (1973); United States v.

To constitute a Fifth Amendment violation under Russell, the government conduct at issue must be fundamentally unfair and shocking to the universal sense of justice, mandated by the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Russell, 411 U.S. at 432, 93 S.Ct. at 1643 (quoting Kinsella v. United States, 361 U.S. 234, 246, 80 S.Ct. 297, 304, 4 L.Ed.2d 268 (1960)). such a reaches demonstrable [13] [T]he determination of when the government's behavior level of outrageousness' to constitute a due process violation is at best elusive. United States v. Bogart, 783 F.2d 1428, 1435 (9th Cir.1986), vacated on other grounds, U.S. v. Wingender, 790 F.2d 802 (9th Cir.1986) (quoting United States v. Jannotti, 673 F.2d 578, 606 (3d Cir.) (en banc), cert. denied, 457 U.S. 1106, 102 S.Ct. 2906, 73 L.Ed.2d 1315 (1982)). Therefore, every case must be resolved on its facts. Bogart, 783 F.2d at 1438. Whether outrageous government misconduct exists turns on the totality of the circumstances. United States v. Tobias, 662 F.2d 381, 387 (5th Cir.1981), cert. denied, 457 U.S. 1108, 102 S.Ct. 2908, 73 L.Ed.2d 1317 (1982). [14] In United States v. Batres Santolino, 521 F.Supp. 744, 750 53 (N.D.Cal.1981), Russell was invoked to dismiss an indictment resulting from outrageous government misconduct which induced the defendant to commit a crime. See also Bogart, 783 F.2d at 1434 38 (discussing the history of the doctrine's evolution and application). However, because the Russell doctrine is grounded in the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment, it may be applied in cases where government interference in an attorney-client relationship is so shocking to the universal sense of justice that it violates due process. See United States v. Ofshe, 817 F.2d 1508, 1516 (11th Cir.1987). [15] The prosecution's argument that its actions were not improper because only Minkin engaged in misconduct is unpersuasive. The Ninth Circuit has distinguished between the government's passive tolerance of misconduct and conscious direction by government agents, suggesting that the former is less egregious and therefore tempers the outrageousness of any government misconduct. Simpson I, 813 F.2d at 1468. In Simpson I, a prostitute working as a government informant developed a sexual relationship with the defendant and then helped to arrange a drug transaction between the defendant and undercover agents. Although the government agent on the case eventually learned of the sexual relationship, he did nothing to encourage the informant to use sex to *1524 carry out her assignment and in fact instructed the informant on numerous occasions to refrain from engaging in sexual activity with the defendant. Id. at 1467 68. Emphasizing the unique facts of the case, the court ruled that the government's conduct was not so outrageous as to shock the conscience. Id. at 1468. The government's actions in this case are far more egregious than the passive tolerance of impropriety in Simpson I. As the court's findings of fact illustrate, the government actively collaborated with Ron Minkin to build a case against the defendant, showing a complete lack of respect for the constitutional rights of the defendant and Minkin's other clients and an utter disregard for the government's ethical obligations. Unlike the government agent in Simpson I, the agents and prosecutor here never warned Minkin not to engage in unethical behavior and in fact facilitated that behavior by hiding it from the defendant. Moreover, the government colluded with Minkin to obtain an indictment against the defendant, to arrest the defendant, to ensure that Minkin would represent the defendant despite his obvious conflict of interest, and to guarantee the defendant's cooperation with the government. The government conduct in this case was anything but passive. to the universal sense of The government misconduct in this case, was also outrageous justice. 12 and shocking The government investigated Marshank using information received from his own attorney. All of the witnesses who testified before the first grand jury were Minkin's clients and had been made available to the government through Minkin. In addition, Minkin himself testified before the second grand jury. The government informed neither Booky nor Marshank of Minkin's cooperation with law enforcement authorities and the obvious conflict of interest this created. Nor did government attorneys, who are officers of the court, inform the courts presiding over the prosecutions of Booky and Marshank of the conflict of interest between Minkin and 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 16 \f U.S. v. Marshank, 777 F.Supp. 1507 (1991) 60 USLW 2386 his clients. Indeed, government agents and the prosecutor allowed Minkin to hide his dealings with the government from his clients and participated in the charade. Having considered the totality of the circumstances, the court concludes that the conduct of the government in the investigation and prosecution of Steven Marshank was so outrageous that it shocked the universal sense of justice. Because the government's conduct was fundamentally unfair, the indictment is DISMISSED. II. Sixth Amendment The defendant contends that the government created a conflict of interest between himself and his attorney which denied him his Sixth Amendment right to counsel. The government denies that it engaged in any misconduct. The government further contends that even if any misconduct did occur, it did not taint the 1990 indictment. Moreover, the government claims that the attorney-client relationship between Minkin and Marshank was invalid because Marshank consulted Minkin in order to carry out illegal activity. Finally, the government contends that Marshank waived the conflict of interest between himself and Minkin by agreeing to pay Seth Booky's legal fees. The right to counsel is indispensable to the [17] [16] fair administration of our adversarial system of criminal justice. Maine v. Moulton, 474 U.S. 159, 168 69, 106 S.Ct. 477, 483, 88 L.Ed.2d 481 (1985). The Ninth Circuit has recognized that government misconduct may have a devastating *1525 effect on a defendant's Sixth Amendment right to counsel. United States v. Owen, 580 F.2d 365, 367 (9th Cir.1978). Indeed, government interference with a defendant's relationship with his attorney may render that attorney's assistance ineffective and thus violate the Sixth Amendment. United States v. Irwin, 612 F.2d at 1185. The Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel includes the right to be represented by counsel whose loyalties are undivided. United States v. Partin, 601 F.2d 1000, 1006 (9th Cir.1979), cert. denied, 446 U.S. 964, 100 S.Ct. 2939, 64 L.Ed.2d 822 (1980). See also Cuyler v. Sullivan, 446 U.S. 335, 348, 100 S.Ct. 1708, 1718, 64 L.Ed.2d 333 (1980). defendant's Sixth Amendment rights are violated only when the government intrusion results in prejudice to the defendant. Id. at 1187. Prejudice may manifest itself in numerous ways, including destruction of the attorney-client relationship. Id. at 1187, 1188 89. [20] As with a Fifth Amendment violation, a violation [19] of the Sixth Amendment requires a remedy tailored to the injury suffered. Morrison, 449 U.S. at 364, 101 S.Ct. at 667; Rogers, 751 F.2d at 1078. Once again, in most cases suppression of the evidence, rather than dismissal, is the appropriate remedy. Morrison, 449 U.S. at 365 66, 366 n. 3, 101 S.Ct. at 668, 669 n. 3; Rogers, 751 F.2d at 1078. However dismissal is appropriate where there is continuing prejudice from a constitutional violation that cannot be remedied by suppression of the evidence. Morrison, 449 U.S. at 365 66 n. 2, 101 S.Ct. at 669 n. 2; Rogers, 751 F.2d at 1078. [21] The prosecution's argument that it engaged in no misconduct is unconvincing because the Supreme Court has explicitly recognized the government's affirmative obligation not to subvert the Sixth Amendment right to counsel. In Maine v. Moulton, the Court stated: Once the right to counsel has attached and been asserted, the State must of course honor it. This means more than simply that the State cannot prevent the accused from obtaining the assistance of counsel. The Sixth Amendment also imposes on the State an affirmative obligation to respect and preserve the accused's choice to seek this assistance. We ... have made clear that, at the very least, the prosecutor and police have an affirmative obligation not to act in a manner that circumvents and thereby dilutes the protection afforded by the right to counsel. 474 U.S. at 170 71, 176, 106 S.Ct. at 484, 487 (emphasis added). Whether government action violates a defendant's right to the assistance of counsel is to be determined in light of this affirmative obligation. Id. [18] Not all government interference constitutes a Sixth Amendment violation. Irwin, 612 F.2d at 1186 87. A 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 17 \f U.S. v. Marshank, 777 F.Supp. 1507 (1991) 60 USLW 2386 [22] Considering the government's collaboration with Ron Minkin in the investigation, arrest and prosecution of the defendant after his September 1987 indictment, it is beyond cavil that the government failed to fulfil its affirmative obligation as described in Moulton. There can be no question but that the government in this case circumvented and diluted the protections guaranteed to the defendant by the Sixth Amendment right to counsel. [23] The government maintains that even if it violated Marshank's Sixth Amendment rights in connection with the first indictment, the second indictment against Marshank remains untainted because it involves different charges. The prosecution correctly points out that the Sixth Amendment attaches only after judicial proceedings have been initiated against a defendant in a criminal case. Brewer v. Williams, 430 U.S. 387, 398, 97 S.Ct. 1232, 1239, 51 L.Ed.2d 424 (1977). However, the government errs in concluding that the defendant's first and second indictments necessarily represent two distinct prosecutions for the purposes of Sixth Amendment analysis. In United States v. Valencia, 541 F.2d 618, 622 (6th Cir.1976), the Sixth Circuit rejected an argument, similar to the one offered by the government here, that the *1526 defendant's Sixth Amendment rights had not been violated because the government interference was related to charges which had been dismissed and was unrelated to the subsequent indictment challenged by the defendant. However, the court ruled that dismissal of an indictment against a defendant does not bring an end to the prosecution of the defendant if the defendant is later reindicted on charges which grow out of the same dealings that were the subject of the [prior] charges. Valencia, 541 F.2d at 622. [24] The Valencia holding reflects the core principles of Sixth Amendment doctrine. The Sixth Amendment attaches after the initiation of judicial proceedings because it is at this point that the government has committed itself to prosecute, and ... the adverse positions of government and defendant have solidified. that faced a defendant with forces of organized society, and immersed in the prosecutorial finds himself It is then the intricacies of substantive and procedural criminal law. Kirby v. Illinois, 406 U.S. 682, 689, 92 S.Ct. 1877, 1882, 32 L.Ed.2d 411 (1972). Having engaged in prosecutorial misconduct the government may not evade the Sixth Amendment simply by dismissing the initial indictment and reindicting the defendant on charges stemming from the same investigation. To hold otherwise would allow the government to use its prosecutorial powers to eviscerate defendants' right to counsel. [25] Applying Valencia to the case at bar, the court concludes that the instant indictment is tainted by the government's violation of the defendant's Sixth Amendment right to counsel. The government's investigation of Steven Marshank revolved around an alleged historical conspiracy involving the importation and sale of marijuana and hashish. The first indictment charged the defendant with offenses that allegedly occurred early on in the conspiracy. The record reveals that the first indictment was dismissed in order to give the government the opportunity to gather additional evidence. The facts also show that the government investigation of the defendant was ongoing at the time the indictment was dismissed, and that the government had every intention of continuing the investigation against the defendant until it had sufficient evidence to reindict him. The Zanides Memorandum explained that in 1987 the government had not gathered sufficient evidence to support a historical drug conspiracy prosecution. Gov. In Camera Submission, Ex. II at 2. In addition, AUSA Zanides complained that the charges against Marshank in the first indictment were too narrow to reflect the defendant's alleged degree of involvement in drug trafficking. Zanides therefore outlined a plan for the continued investigation of Marshank in order to broaden the charges in a second indictment. Id. at 3 4. Following-up on information provided by the cooperating defendants, Minkin's cooperating clients, was central to this plan. Id. In the months following the dismissal of the first indictment, Minkin remained in frequent contact with government agents so as to assist them in the investigation of Marshank. He arranged a meeting between government agents and his cooperating clients, Ohlgart and Crawford, to encourage the continued cooperation of the two men in the 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 18 \f U.S. v. Marshank, 777 F.Supp. 1507 (1991) 60 USLW 2386 investigation. Minkin had numerous telephone conversations with government agents regarding the investigation leading up to the second indictment of Marshank. Indeed, Minkin's participation in the investigation of Marshank did not end until the defendant filed this motion to dismiss and AUSA Howden advised government agents to cease communication with Minkin. The proceedings before the second grand jury show that Minkin's client Seth Booky was the government's key witness against the defendant. Booky's testimony took up a substantial portion of the proceedings and was the foundation upon which the government built its case against Marshank. See Grand Jury 87 4, Testimony of Seth Booky, July 17, 1988; Grand Jury 89 3, Testimony of Paul Rozairo (reading testimony of Booky), December 14, 1989; Grand Jury 89 3, Testimony of Dan McCurrie *1527 (reading testimony of Booky), January 11, 1990; Grand Jury 89 3, Testimony of Seth Booky, March 15, 1990. The second indictment was, unquestionably, a result of the government's ongoing investigation of Marshank, which began in 1986, prior to the first indictment. The overt acts alleged in the second indictment primarily involved illegal activity which Marshank and Seth Booky engaged in together. Indeed, the record of the second grand jury proceedings makes it clear that Booky was the source of virtually all of the allegations of overt acts. Booky was the source of every act for which a source was identified. Grand Jury 89 3, Testimony of Robert Heng, July 26, 1990, at 43 44, 46 49, 52, 54, 57, 73 74, 77 78, 80, 81. The testimony of Agent Heng strongly suggests that, with the exception of two acts of which Booky had no knowledge, Booky was the source for each of the forty-four overt acts in which it is alleged that the defendant participated. 13 Booky's prominence is so striking that one of the grand jurors expressed concern that the informant appeared to be the sole source of the government's charges. Testimony of Heng, at 19. Based on the proceedings before the second grand jury, the court concludes that there would have been no second indictment without Booky's cooperation with the government's investigation. In light of these facts, the court finds that the two indictments are, for purposes of Sixth Amendment analysis, part of the same prosecution of Marshank. [27] The government argues that the attorney- [28] [26] client relationship between Marshank and Minkin was invalid because the two were engaged in ongoing illegal activity. The government relies on In re Grand Jury Proceedings, 867 F.2d 539, 541 (9th Cir.1989), which holds that the attorney- client privilege is vitiated when a client consults an attorney for legal assistance in carrying out a crime. To establish a prima facie case for this, so-called crime-fraud exception to the attorney-client privilege, the government must rely on evidence independent of the communications between the client and the attorney. Id. In addition, where an attorney has represented a defendant in the same criminal matter in which the attorney is implicated, the crime-fraud exception does not thereby justify an abrogation of the privilege as to all dealings between the two, as attorney and client. United States v. Alexander, 736 F.Supp. 968, 1003 (D.Minn.1990). *1528 Where a defendant has had discussions with an attorney regarding his or her defense against criminal charges, those conversations are lawful and fall within the ambit of the attorney-client privilege even if there is evidence that the attorney participated in other illegal activity with the defendant. Valencia, 541 F.2d at 621. The government's argument for the crime-fraud exception to attorney-client privilege lacks merit for three reasons. First, while there is evidence in the record that Minkin may have been involved in criminal activity, it is not enough to establish a prima facie case that the defendant consulted with Minkin to complete a crime. 14 Second, discussions between Minkin and Marshank regarding criminal charges already facing the defendant do not fall within the crime- fraud exception. Valencia, 541 F.2d at 621; Alexander, 736 F.Supp. at 1003. Third, the crime-fraud exception was simply not meant to be applied in the manner which the government attempts here. Because the attorney-client privilege is not to be used as a cloak for illegal or fraudulent behavior, it is well-established that the privilege does not apply where legal representation was secured in furtherance of intended, or present, continuing illegality. United States v. Hodge and Zweig, 548 F.2d 1347, 1354 (9th Cir.1977). The exception is to be considered where the government seeks disclosure of information regarding continuing illegality which would otherwise be covered by the attorney-client privilege. Id. The exception does not allow prosecutors to ignore altogether the attorney-client relationship. 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 19 \f Finally, the government's argument that [30] [31] U.S. v. Marshank, 777 F.Supp. 1507 (1991) 60 USLW 2386 [29] the defendant waived his conflict of interest with Marshank by paying Booky's legal fees is absolutely meritless. In situations where there is no conflict of interest, a defendant may waive his right to assistance of counsel; however, that waiver must be knowing and intelligent. See Partin, 601 F.2d at 1008. Where an attorney represents both a defendant and a government informant in the same case, the court must disclose the potential conflict of interest to the defendant on the record before there can be a knowing and intelligent waiver. United States v. Levy, 577 F.2d 200, 211 (3d Cir.1978) (citing Holloway v. Arkansas, 435 U.S. 475, 98 S.Ct. 1173, 55 L.Ed.2d 426 (1978)). Clearly, there was no knowing and intelligent waiver by the defendant in this case. Although Marshank was aware that Minkin was also representing Seth Booky, he had no knowledge of Booky's activities as a government informant or of Minkin's role in facilitating those activities. Indeed, Booky, Minkin and the government hid this information from Marshank. Nor did the court ever disclose the conflict of interest, as the government never informed the court of the joint representation of Booky and Marshank. As the government was aware that Minkin was using a front attorney in Booky's case to hide the conflict of interest problem from the court, the government's suggestion that the defendant somehow waived his Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel is simply galling. Therefore, the court finds that the indictment must be DISMISSED under the Sixth Amendment. A court may dismiss an indictment for [33] [34] III. Supervisory Power [32] prosecutorial misconduct either on constitutional grounds or by exercising its supervisory power. United States v. Carrasco, 786 F.2d 1452, 1455 (9th Cir.1986). The three legitimate bases for the exercise of the supervisory power are: (1) to remedy a violation of a statutory or constitutional right; (2) to preserve judicial integrity; and (3) to deter future illegal conduct. United States v. Simpson, 927 F.2d 1088, 1090 (9th Cir.1991) (Simpson II ). The court's supervisory power may be used to vindicate a defendant's rights, as well as to preserve judicial integrity and/or to deter illegal or improper conduct. *1529 United States v. Hasting, 461 U.S. 499, 505, 103 S.Ct. 1974, 1978, 76 L.Ed.2d 96 (1983); Carrasco, 786 F.2d at 1455. The supervisory power has frequently been used by federal courts as a means of sanctioning and deterring prosecutorial misconduct. 15 An important function of our supervisory power is to guarantee that federal prosecutors act with due regard for the integrity of the administration of justice. United States v. Basurto, 497 F.2d 781, 793 (9th Cir.1974) (Hufstedler, J., concurring). [35] It is well-established that a federal court may use its supervisory power to dismiss an indictment on the basis of government misconduct. United States v. Owen, 580 F.2d 365, 367 (9th Cir.1978). As such, dismissal is used as a prophylactic tool for discouraging future deliberate governmental impropriety of a similar nature. Id.; see also United States v. Samango, 607 F.2d 877, 884 (9th Cir.1979) (court exercising supervisory power to dismiss indictment where cumulative effect of errors and prosecutorial misconduct was to produce a biased grand jury); United States v. Isgro, 751 F.Supp. 846, 851 (C.D.Cal.1990) (court dismissing indictment because of prosecutorial misconduct before grand jury). While a court may use its supervisory power [37] [36] to dismiss an indictment, dismissal is, generally speaking, a disfavored remedy. Rogers, 751 F.2d at 1076 77. For this reason, a court may dismiss an indictment only in flagrant cases of prosecutorial misconduct. U.S. v. Jacobs, 855 F.2d 652, 655 (9th Cir.1988); Carrasco, 786 F.2d at 1455. However, since this standard is so vague that it fails to illuminate the applicable legal principles, and provides district judges who are called upon to apply it precious little guidance, U.S. v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., Inc., 719 F.2d 1386, 1391 n. 6 (9th Cir.1983), courts must determine when to exercise their supervisory power to dismiss an indictment on a case-by-case basis. United States v. De Rosa, 783 F.2d 1401, 1406 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 477 U.S. 908, 106 S.Ct. 3282, 91 L.Ed.2d 571 (1986). [38] To warrant dismissal, the government's misconduct must not only be flagrant, but must also have prejudiced the defendant. Bank of Nova Scotia v. United States, 487 U.S. 250, 254, 108 S.Ct. 2369, 2373, 101 L.Ed.2d 228 (1988). As the Supreme Court pointed out in Bank of Nova Scotia, 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 20 \f U.S. v. Marshank, 777 F.Supp. 1507 (1991) 60 USLW 2386 where the error is harmless, concerns about the integrity of the [judicial] process' will carry less weight. Id. at 255, 108 S.Ct. at 2374 (quoting United States v. Hasting, 461 U.S. at 506, 103 S.Ct. at 1979). [39] It is not necessary to review the government's conduct in this case yet again in order to determine whether it is appropriate for the court to exercise its supervisory power to dismiss the indictment against the defendant. The court invokes its supervisory power to dismiss the indictment in order to remedy the violation of the defendant's Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights, to preserve judicial integrity, and to deter future government misconduct. The court's previous discussion makes clear the need to remedy the violation of the defendant's constitutional rights and to deter future government misconduct. With regard to the preservation of judicial integrity, the court notes that Rule 3 310 of the Rules of Professional Conduct of the State Bar of California provides in pertinent part: (B) A member shall not concurrently represent clients whose interests conflict, except with their informed written consent. .... standards of professional conduct for the Northern District of California. 16 Rule 3 310 was violated in numerous instances by Ron Minkin. Judicial integrity is severely threatened when professional ethical and court rules such as those involved here are flouted by the government. The court, therefore, DISMISSES the indictment in the exercise of its supervisory power. 17 CONCLUSION The government in this case collaborated with the defendant's attorney in an effort to investigate, arrest and prosecute the defendant. This collaboration included using some of Minkin's other clients as government informants in the defendant's investigation. The government's misconduct in this case robbed the defendant of his right to effective assistance of counsel and his right to due process of law. The government's actions also displayed a complete disregard for the professional duty attorneys owe to their clients and for the ethical obligation prosecutors have as officers of the court. For these reasons the court DISMISSES the indictment against the defendant on Fifth Amendment grounds, Sixth Amendment grounds and as an exercise of the court's supervisory power. *1530 (F) As used in this rule informed means full disclosure to the client of the circumstances and advice to the client of any actual or reasonably foreseeable adverse effects of those circumstances upon the representation. This court, through its Local Rules, has adopted the State Bar's Rules of Professional Conduct as the applicable IT IS SO ORDERED.

Rasmussen is an attorney and has been a member of the Utah Bar since 1987. Booky became an active informant for the government and provided information leading to both the 1987 and the current indictment against Marshank. Minkin is Booky's attorney. AUSA Robinson was the prosecutor assigned to Booky's case. Yamashita was Agent Ames' supervisor beginning in early July 1987 and continuing throughout the investigation of the defendant. There are other discrepancies between the testimony of Robinson and Ames. For instance, Robinson testified that he did not know about the task force formed in Los Angeles to investigate the defendant or of the plan to use Booky as an 2 3 4 5 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 21 \f U.S. v. Marshank, 777 F.Supp. 1507 (1991) 60 USLW 2386 active informant. RT at 2 312 313, 319 321. Ames, however, testified that he told Robinson of the task force that was formed at the Los Angeles meetings. RT at 3 589. It is clear that either Ames or Robinson is not telling the truth. The court is hard pressed to believe that Ames, the case agent, would not have informed Robinson, the AUSA in charge of the case, of such important developments in the case. However, given that either version of the story reveals government complicity with Minkin, it unnecessary for the court to resolve the conflict between the witnesses' testimony. Booky, in his testimony before the second grand jury to indict Marshank, described the moments after his arrest and leading up to his decision to cooperate with the government as follows: 6 And they took us up to the Santa Rosa Courthouse, down to the police station down there, and everybody was in separate rooms. .... And they come in, close the door, and say, Hello, Mr. Booky, I'm Ed Ames and I'm Peter Robinson. They said We would like your help, Mr. Booky. We have this case dead to rights, but we know who you are, and we'd like your help. We'd like your cooperation, and you could make it easy on yourself if you help us now. They said, We're looking for forfeitures and there's a reward to be had and we're willing to offer those to you if you make a deal right now. We want your cooperation. I said, Look, I have to talk to my lawyer. I said, I'm not gonna say anything to you guys before I talk to my lawyer. So I thought that I'd get on the phone to my lawyer. His name's Ron Minkin. And I thought he'd tell me, Seth, don't say anything. Because that's what he told me before, because that's what he told me in Hawaii, and that's the general procedure. .... But I get on the phone to Ron, and he says, Seth, he says, look, there's a lot you don't know. He says, I know a lot you don't know, but I gotta tell you, you're in big trouble and you got no choice. He says, Seth, your life is over. He says, You've got to cooperate with the government. Now this came to me I'm saying, What? I know this guy. He's a lawyer. He's a criminal defense lawyer. .... I says, What are you talking about? He says, Don't ask me. He says, As a friend and as your lawyer, you have no choice. And I said, But, Ron, I only got caught I only got 15 pounds in the car. He says, Seth, you got no choice. You've gotta make up your mind right now. From the tone of his voice, there was more to it than I knew. There was just more to it. And knowing him as being a friend, I knew he cared about me personally, other than a lawyer/client relationship. He just left me with no options. And right then and there, I made up my mind. Yeah, he says, look Ron says to me, he says, Look, Seth, I'll make you the best deal I can. He says, There's rewards that you can have if you lead these guys to forfeitures. He says, You won't do any time. He says it like he already had made this deal. And I So he says, Let me talk to those guys, meaning Ames and Robinson. So he gets on the phone with Ames and Robinson, and I hear half the conversations, you know. You know, I coudn't [sic] hear Ron, but I could hear their end. Actually, I heard Ames say, Yeah, there's rewards, yeah, Ron, like he knew Ron, which, you know, I didn't know what was going on. Then I hear him talking to Robinson.

Grand Jury Proceedings, Testimony of Seth Booky, March 15, 1990, at 298 32. Minkin and Booky have brought an action against the government for monies to which they claim they are entitled as a result of Booky's cooperation in the Marshank investigation and the representation agreement between Booky and Minkin. RT at 3 657. Contrary to the testimony of Agent Ames, Robinson testified that he did not know that the defendant provided money to Minkin for Booky's ostensible defense. The former AUSA testified that had he known about the funds he would not have allowed Minkin to keep the money. For the same reasons stated in Note five, the court need not resolve this conflicting testimony. RT at 2 296 297. Robinson testified that although he spoke to Ames in Florida after Marshank was arrested, the two men never discussed Minkin's potential conflict of interest. RT at 2 307. Once again, there is no need to resolve the discrepancy between the testimony of Robinson and the government agent. The government produced notes taken by agents in conjunction with many of these calls. The notes provide information regarding the following: 1) calls by Minkin to Yamashita on October 31, 1987, November 9, 1987, November 11, 1987, November 18, 1987, November 25, 1987, January 6, 1988, and July 17, 1989. Def. Ex. O. There are also ten pages of undated notes written by Yamashita. 2) calls by Minkin to Heng on August 22, 1989 and March 19, 1990. There are also several pages of undated notes by Heng. The government attempts to distinguish the evidence provided to it by Minkin from that provided by his cooperating clients, arguing that only the former is potentially violative of the defendant's constitutional rights. However, the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine applies to evidence obtained in violation of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel as well as the Fifth Amendment right to due process. U.S. v. Terzado Madruga, 897 F.2d 1099, 1113 (11th Cir.1990) (citing U.S. v. Wade, 388 U.S. 218, 87 S.Ct. 1926, 18 L.Ed.2d 1149 (1967) and Kastigar v. U.S., 406 U.S. 441, 92 S.Ct. 1653, 32 L.Ed.2d 212 (1972)). Therefore, the exclusionary doctrine applies to any incriminating evidence derived from primary evidence obtained in violation of a defendant's Fifth or Sixth Amendment rights. In light of the fact that the cooperation of Minkin's clients was a direct result of Minkin's collaboration with the government, use of evidence obtained from these government informants against Marshank must be deemed violative of the defendant's constitutional rights. Even members of the grand jury hearing Minkin's testimony in connection with the second indictment had some concerns about Minkin's dual role. One grand juror asked Didn't you feel that you worked for the government by giving the information from A to B? Grand Jury 89 3, Testimony of Ron Minkin, June 28, 1990, at 44. Apparently the Grand jury was not satisfied with the answer because once again a grand juror asked, So you acted as a government agent by making sure Mr. Marshank would cooperate and he would be flown home immediately? Id. at 45. However, before Minkin could answer the AUSA interrupted and the first part of the question was never answered. Of the thirteen witnesses to appear before the second grand jury in addition to Booky and Minkin, two (Paul Rozario and Dan McCurrie) were government agents reading previous testimony of Booky and two (Maura McNulty and Robert Heng) were government agents relaying information obtained either from Booky or Scott Alexander Moffett. Moffett testified before the grand jury and retracted any statements he made previously concerning Marshank, stating that he had given false information to the government under pressure and in the hopes of receiving a lighter sentence for a drug conviction. Grand Jury 89 3, Testimony of Moffett, at 21 22, 42. Also appearing were Norman Jay Marshank, the defendant's father; Charles Laver of the Sonoma County Sheriff's Department; John Matheson; Wendy Rothcopf; Kenneth Schatzberg; Burt McCumber; Joseph Cooper; and Thomis Larson. Norman Marshank provided no incriminating information concerning the defendant, Grand Jury 89 3, Testimony of Norman Marshank; Laver testified that he knew nothing about Marshank other than rumors he had heard, Grand Jury 89 3, Testimony of Laver, at 14; Rothcopf testified only that she had met the defendant socially three or four times, Grand Jury 89 3, Testimony of Rothcopf, at 13; McCumber testified that he had never met the defendant and did not recognize Marshank's name, Grand Jury 89 3, Testimony of McCumber, at 32; and Larson provided no testimony concerning the defendant, Grand Jury 89 3, Testimony of Larson. Matheson, Schatzberg and Cooper did provide some incriminating information concerning Marshank. However, it appears that only the information supplied by Schatzberg, who was identified to the government by Booky, Grand Jury 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 23 \f U.S. v. Marshank, 777 F.Supp. 1507 (1991) 60 USLW 2386 14 15 16 17 89 3, Testimony of Heng, at 73, made its way into the second indictment. See Second Indictment of Steven Marshank, Overt Acts, para. 31. The overt act contained in the second indictment and testified to by Schatzberg involved a drug transaction between Booky and Schatzberg; the government learned of this transaction from Booky. Grand Jury 89 3, Testimony of Heng. It thus appears that the government relied almost exclusively on Booky in formulating its second indictment against Marshank. Matheson, Schatzberg and Cooper are seemingly extras who may have been included in the grand jury proceedings by the government to mask the prosecution's reliance on Booky. Indeed, if there was evidence of Minkin's involvement in criminal activity with Marshank, it is curious that the government never undertook to investigate or prosecute Minkin. The supervisory power has been used by courts in many contexts, including to reverse a conviction supported by false evidence, Mesarosh v. United States, 352 U.S. 1, 14, 77 S.Ct. 1, 8, 1 L.Ed.2d 1 (1956); to punish improper practices by federal attorneys, United States v. Hale, 422 U.S. 171, 180 & n. 7, 95 S.Ct. 2133, 2138 & n. 7, 45 L.Ed.2d 99 (1975); United States v. Banks, 383 F.Supp. 389, 397 (D.S.D.1974), appeal dismissed sub nom. United States v. Means, 513 F.2d 1329 (8th Cir.1975); and to suppress evidence gained by government agents through misconduct. Mallory v. United States, 354 U.S. 449, 455 56, 77 S.Ct. 1356, 1359 60, 1 L.Ed.2d 1479 (1957); Rea v. United States, 350 U.S. 214, 217 18, 76 S.Ct. 292, 294, 100 L.Ed. 233 (1956). U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, Local Rule 110 3. In determining if government actions are sufficiently egregious to warrant dismissal as a means of deterring future misconduct, courts often have been guided by two considerations. First, courts have looked to whether there is a pattern of similar government misconduct, on the theory that such widespread misconduct increases the threat to judicial integrity. See, e.g., United States v. Griffith, 756 F.2d 1244, 1249 (6th Cir.1985), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 837, 106 S.Ct. 114, 88 L.Ed.2d 93 (1985); United States v. Rosenfield, 780 F.2d 10, 11 (3d Cir.1985), cert. denied, 478 U.S. 1004, 106 S.Ct. 3294, 92 L.Ed.2d 709 (1986). Second, courts have looked to whether there is any alternative remedy which the court may effectively use as a means of deterrence. Bank of Nova Scotia, 487 U.S. at 255, 108 S.Ct. at 2374; Simpson II, 927 F.2d at 1091 92 (Nelson, J., concurring). Because the court invokes its supervisory power in part to remedy the violation of the defendant's constitutional rights, and in part because it has already been determined that nothing short of dismissal will remedy this violation, the court need not consider the extent to which the government's misconduct here is part of a larger pattern.

Marshank and two co-defendants were indicted and charged with federal statutory violations related to their alleged membership in an organization which imported large amounts of hashish and marijuana into the United States. 1 Marshank brings this motion to dismiss the indictment against him, alleging that the United States government ( government ) violated his Sixth Amendment right to counsel and Fifth Amendment right to due process. Specifically, Marshank alleges that throughout the investigation of his case, his former attorney, 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 6 \f U.S. v. Marshank, 777 F.Supp. 1507 (1991) 60 USLW 2386 Ronald Minkin, had an ongoing relationship with government agents from various federal law enforcement agencies and the Assistant United States Attorneys ( AUSA ) assigned to his case. Marshank alleges that these agents and AUSAs, with full knowledge that Minkin was defendant's attorney, encouraged Minkin to actively aid the government's investigation of the defendant. Marshank further maintains that the government exploited the information they received from Minkin to arrest and prosecute him. This complicity, Marshank contends, occurred throughout the course of the investigation which led to a 1987 indictment of defendant, subsequently dismissed by the government, and continued during the investigation leading to the instant indictment. After reviewing the arguments and submissions of the parties, the court found that further evidence was necessary in order to rule on the motion to dismiss and held an evidentiary hearing pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 611. The following witnesses testified at the hearing: 1) Ronald Minkin, the defendant's former attorney; 2) Peter Robinson, the AUSA assigned to defendant's case in 1987; 3) Lee C. Rasmussen, an F.B.I. agent who worked in the narcotics unit of the Organized Crime Division in Los Angeles from 1982 through January 1990; 2 4) Edward Ames, a U.S. Customs agent in San Francisco; 5) Seth R. Booky, a former associate of Marshank who was indicted for drug trafficking in 1987; 3 6) Robert Heng, a special agent with the Drug Enforcement Administration; and 7) Wayne N. Yamashita, a special agent with the U.S. Customs Service in San Francisco. 4 In addition to the parties' moving papers and the testimony presented at the hearing, *1512 the agents submitted declarations. The government, pursuant to the court's discovery order, turned over numerous documents, including internal agency memoranda, agents' notes of meetings among themselves and with Minkin, and notes of telephone conversations between various agents and Minkin. FINDINGS OF FACT Taken together, the hearing testimony, the discovery material and the parties' moving papers tell the shocking tale of a criminal defense attorney who was oblivious to the professional norms of ethical behavior and a cast of overzealous government agents and prosecutors who facilitated the attorney's unethical conduct in an attempt to catch a big fish. Most of the facts are substantially undisputed; some of them are in sharp dispute. The following narrative embodies the court's findings of fact. The story began in 1986 when Ronald Minkin, a criminal defense attorney, approached AUSA James Walsh in Los Angeles on behalf of two clients, Gary Crawford and Gary Ohlgart. Although Crawford and Ohlgart had never been indicted and were not at that time under investigation, they wished to dissociate themselves from the drug business by providing information to the government in exchange for immunity from prosecution, complete anonymity and the promise that they would never have to testify in court. RT at 1 24. Minkin arranged a deal under these terms, on behalf of Crawford and Ohlgart, with AUSA James Walsh. Def.Ex. A. In August 1986 several agents, including F.B.I. agent Lee Rasmussen, debriefed Crawford and Ohlgart in Los Angeles. RT at 2 399. Minkin was present at this meeting. RT at 2 399 400. Crawford, Ohlgart and Minkin provided information about suspects in a major marijuana and hashish smuggling operation. RT at 2 402. Those suspects included several of Minkin's former and present clients, among them Stephen Marshank, Seth Booky, and Robert Wehe. Minkin's Los Angeles law firm had represented Marshank in a divorce proceeding in 1982 and 1983, Def.Ex. Z, and Minkin had personally represented Seth Booky on a drug-related charge in Hawaii in 1983. RT at 3 660. Both Marshank and Booky had ongoing attorney-client relationships with Minkin. Minkin, Crawford and Ohlgart made a diagram which sketched out the relationships among the various individuals they named. The defendant's name appeared on the chart, which came to be known as the matrix. Def.Ex. 1. On February 5 and 6, 1987, another meeting was held in Los Angeles. This meeting was attended by members of the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force ( OCDETF ), DEA agents, United States Customs agents from San Francisco and Los Angeles and three Assistant United States Attorneys. A task force was formed to develop a plan of action which would lead to the indictment of Booky, and then with Booky's cooperation, to the indictment of Marshank. The task force included various agents from Los Angeles and San Francisco, including Ames and Rasmussen. Def.Ex. P; RT at 2 416. It was determined at this meeting that because Crawford and Ohlgart had been promised that they would not have to testify, an inside individual would 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 7 \f U.S. v. Marshank, 777 F.Supp. 1507 (1991) 60 USLW 2386 be needed for the government to pursue the plan. RT at 2 404 05. The agents initially decided to target Robert Wehe, who was already the subject of a sealed indictment, for the inside individual role. RT at 2 405. Ron Minkin had represented Wehe in the past, id., and Wehe was chosen because Minkin told the agents that he [Minkin] could bring him in. RT at 2 412. Minkin contacted Wehe and mediated an agreement between Wehe and the government in which Wehe agreed to surrender and cooperate with the government. Def.Ex. D at 2. After his arrest while represented by Minkin, Wehe provided information about the defendant to the government. RT at 3 578. It eventually became apparent to the government that Wehe had a drinking problem which made him an unreliable active informant. RT at 2 420. The government then shifted its focus to Seth Booky, another of Minkin's former clients who had *1513 been named by Minkin, Crawford and Ohlgart. The plan was to indict Booky on a historical conspiracy charge. RT at 2 419. Booky would then cooperate with the government, wear a wire, make telephone calls and provide the necessary active work based upon the intelligence information provided by Crawford and Ohlgart. Def.Ex. P at 2. Marshank would be one of the major targets of the investigation. Def.Ex. P at 2; RT at 2 315, 2 425, 3 583. Minkin informed the government agents that he had represented Booky in Hawaii in 1983 and that Booky would be likely to cooperate. RT at 2 419 21. The plan to elicit Booky's cooperation in exchange for a plea agreement, RT at 2 421 22, changed in May 1987 when Minkin called Agent Ames and informed him that Booky was involved in a large marijuana deal. RT at 3 562. Ames testified that at the time he received the telephone call from Minkin he was aware that Minkin had represented Booky in the past. RT at 3 562. Based upon Minkin's information, AUSA Robinson authorized the arrest of Booky. On Memorial Day 1987, Agent Ames and the Sonoma County Sheriff's Department arrested nine individuals, including Booky, for the sale of one thousand five hundred pounds of marijuana. Ames Decl. at 6. Agent Ames never informed Booky that Minkin was the person who provided the government with the information leading to his arrest. RT at 3 565. Although there are some inconsistencies in the testimony of the various witnesses, it is clear that prior to Booky's arrest the government agents and the AUSAs on the case were aware that Minkin had represented Booky in the past and would probably represent him after he was arrested. AUSA Robinson, for example, stated that he understood from Ames that Minkin had represented Seth Booky in the past and would likely initially represent Booky after his arrest. Robinson Decl. 8. Booky himself had considered Minkin to be his attorney since 1983. RT at 3 686. The government also knew that Minkin had provided the information that led to Booky's arrest either directly or by relaying information from Crawford and Ohlgart. RT at 3 586. While AUSA Robinson denies that he knew at the time that the information leading to the arrest of Booky had been supplied by Booky's own lawyer, he concedes that he was aware that incriminating information concerning Booky had come from Crawford and Ohlgart, whom he knew were represented by Minkin. RT at 2 277. Robinson admits that he was aware that this situation represented a serious conflict of interest. RT at 2 278 79. Agent Ames testified that he told Robinson at the time of Booky's arrest that he [Ames] had received the information leading to Booky's arrest directly from Minkin. RT at 3 586. 5 After Booky's arrest, Robinson and Ames met with Booky in the Marin County Jail. The agents told him that they were willing to work out a deal whereby he would be awarded a percentage of the property forfeited as a result of his assistance. RT at 3 650 51. Booky contacted Minkin, who instructed his client in an extremely urgent way to cooperate with the government. RT at 3 652. 6 Minkin *1514 then negotiated a settlement of the case, including cooperation, with Robinson. RT at 2 274 75. Robinson never raised the issue of conflict of interest with Minkin or Booky during the plea negotiations although he was aware that Minkin's clients, Crawford and Ohlgart, acting under a cooperation agreement negotiated by Minkin, had provided the information leading to Booky's arrest. RT at 2 280. Nor did Robinson ever raise the issue of conflict of interest with the court. RT at 2 285. Subsequently, Booky entered into a representation agreement with Minkin which guaranteed Minkin one third of all 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 8 \f U.S. v. Marshank, 777 F.Supp. 1507 (1991) 60 USLW 2386 sums the government paid to Booky as a result of his cooperation. This included any monies Booky might receive for information leading to forfeiture of property. 7 Def.Ex.H. Although Minkin continued to represent Booky, Booky's attorney of record was Vincent Oliver, who rented space in Minkin's law office. Oliver acted as a front attorney. RT at 3 577. Both Robinson and Ames were aware that Minkin actually represented Booky. RT at 2 284, 3 577. The only court appearance Minkin made for Booky was at his sentencing on January 29, 1988. RT at 2 285. During the time between Booky's arrest on May 31, 1987 and Marshank's indictment on September 16, 1987, the task force investigation centered on Marshank and Daniel Hartog, who was suspected of running a large scale marijuana and hashish *1515 smuggling operation. With Minkin's assistance, the government used Booky to investigate both Hartog and Marshank. Booky was wired to record conversations with Marshank and engaged in other active work on the government's behalf. RT at 3 530. The government used Booky in this capacity, knowing full well that Booky's lawyer, Minkin, represented: 1) Crawford and Ohlgart, who had provided incriminating information about Booky and Marshank; 2) Bobby Wehe, who had provided incriminating information about Booky and Marshank; and 3) Booky himself, who was actively obtaining and providing incriminating information about Marshank. RT at 2 269, 3 530. In addition, Minkin told the government that he was likely to represent Marshank and that Marshank was likely to cooperate with the government. RT at 2 269. Booky eventually entered the Federal Witness Protection Program. Prior to that time the government's only access to Booky was through Minkin. Booky was hidden by Minkin and only Minkin knew his location. RT at 3 758. The government thus benefitted from Minkin's role as a conduit between Booky and the government agents and AUSAs. RT at 3 759. After Booky's arrest, the government agents believed that in order for Booky to remain a viable active informant, he would have to convince his confederates that he had not rolled over and was still fighting the prosecution of his case. Minkin, Booky and Agent Ames agreed that Booky should act as if he were not cooperating with the government and as if Minkin were defending him. RT at 3 569. During the summer of 1987 Booky began to put pressure on his confederates, including Marshank, to pay for his supposed defense and to provide him with living expenses. See Heng Decl., Exs. B, C, E. Marshank paid ten thousand dollars to Minkin for Booky's defense and expenses. RT at 3 596. Booky ostensibly requested the payment to convince his confederates that he had not become a government informant. RT at 3 576. The government was aware that Booky was pressuring Marshank for money to pay Minkin's fees. Booky had several phone conversations with Marshank in which he indicated that he needed money to pay Minkin for his defense. These phone conversations were recorded by the government. Heng Decl., Exs. C at 5 8, Ex. E. Agent Ames testified that he told Robinson about the payment of money by Marshank to Minkin, RT at 3 587 88, 3 598, and that Robinson must have been aware of the payments because in the summer of 1987 he was the AUSA on the case and was aware of the contents of the taped Booky phone conversations. RT at 3 528. 8 The government, however, allowed both Booky and Minkin to keep the money. None of the money paid to Booky and Minkin was ever seized. RT at 3 596 98. The government subsequently used the payment of Minkin's fees as evidence against Marshank in the second grand jury proceeding against him. RT 3 673. During the time between Booky's arrest and the defendant's indictment, Booky received over twenty thousand dollars from various sources. RT at 3 645. Minkin received ten thousand dollars from Marshank for Booky's ostensible defense. Grand Jury Proceedings, Testimony of Ronald Minkin, June 28, 1990, at 27 28. Minkin testified that he gave half of that sum to Oliver and returned the other half to Booky for living expenses. RT at 1 186. In the summer of 1987 it became clear to the government that Booky was suspected by his confederates. Booky reported that he was finding it difficult to get close to Hartog. RT at 3 677. Robinson, Ames and Yamashita decided to use the information provided by Booky and Minkin to indict Marshank on a historical conspiracy charge in the hopes that Marshank would then *1516 provide information about a thirty-five ton shipment of marijuana, known as the Hartog Load , that was allegedly being shipped from Thailand.

Marshank, 777 F.Supp. 1507 (1991) 60 USLW 2386 During the 1987 pre-indictment investigation of Marshank, then AUSA Robinson knew that Minkin was representing Marshank. RT at 2 269, 2 323 24. Robinson also knew that Minkin had told Agent Ames that Marshank would probably cooperate with the government because Minkin had been Marshank's lawyer previously. RT at 2 328, 2 350. In addition, Robinson was aware that the government would use information from Minkin's other clients to indict Marshank. RT at 2 333. Minkin's role, assigned to him by the government, was to encourage and bring about Marshank's cooperation. RT at 2 324. After the decision was made to indict and arrest Marshank, the grand jury heard testimony from several witnesses. All of the witnesses who provided testimony against Marshank were clients of Ron Minkin. RT at 2 272. The grand jury witnesses were Seth Booky, Robert Wehe, and a government agent who summarized a statement taken from David Vandrell, another of Minkin's clients. RT at 2 270, 2 352. Although the government was ready to arrest Marshank following his indictment on September 16, 1987, his whereabouts were unknown. RT at 3 535. Agent Ames called Agent Rasmussen, who gave Minkin's telephone number to Ames. RT at 2 496. Ames then phoned Minkin.

Agent Yamashita testified that it is highly unusual for a government agent to suggest that a suspect contact legal counsel upon making an arrest and that the standard procedure for Customs agents is to avoid any mention of attorneys after suspects are given the Miranda warning so as not to damage the possibility of obtaining an interview with the suspect.

After Marshank was returned to San Francisco, he dismissed Minkin and retained his current counsel. Marshank's ex-wife, Jane Wechsler, stated that she called Minkin on October 6, 1987, after learning of Marshank's arrest, to see if she could be of any help. In her sworn declaration, Wechsler recounted that Minkin claimed he was the only person who could handle Steven's case, that if Steven knew what was best he would keep Minkin as his lawyer and would cooperate with the government one hundred percent.

Minkin also allegedly told Wechsler that Marshank would have to pay Minkin one million dollars and that federal agents would see to it that Marshank was able to obtain money from foreign bank accounts. Wechsler Aff. 8, 9. In addition, Wechsler contends that Minkin suggested that it would be helpful for government agents to arrest Julie Aldwell, a friend of Marshank's with whom he was purportedly involved in drug smuggling. Wechsler Aff. 18. Minkin allegedly told Wechsler that Aldwell's arrest would help Marshank come to his senses, since Aldwell would be forced to inform on Marshank in order to save herself and Marshank would then feel the noose tightening around his neck.

RT at 2 477, 3 810. DISCUSSION The defendant argues that the indictment against him must be dismissed because the government engaged in prosecutorial misconduct which violated his Fifth Amendment right to due process and Sixth Amendment right to assistance of counsel. While application of the Sixth Amendment is [2] I. Fifth Amendment [1] limited to government action which occurs after the initiation of adverse criminal proceedings, a defendant's remedy for prosecutorial misconduct in the pre-indictment stage is provided in the due process protections of the Fifth Amendment. United States v. Marion, 404 U.S. 307, 315, 92 S.Ct. 455, 460, 30 L.Ed.2d 468 (1971); United States v. Simmons, 536 F.2d 827, 830 n. 9 (9th Cir.1976). Depending *1519 on when it occurs, government misconduct which subverts a defendant's relationship with his client may be judged under the standards of both the Fifth and the Sixth Amendments. A Fifth Amendment due process violation may occur when government interference in an attorney-client relationship results in ineffective assistance of counsel or when the government engages in outrageous misconduct. A. Ineffective Assistance Of Counsel is rendered [3] When the government interferes in a defendant's relationship with his attorney to the degree that counsel's assistance the government's misconduct may violate the defendant's Fifth Amendment right to due process as well as his Sixth Amendment right to counsel. United States v. Irwin, 612 F.2d 1182, 1185 (9th Cir.1980). ineffective, [5] Prosecutorial misconduct constitutes a due [4] process violation under Irwin only where the defendant has been prejudiced. Id. at 1187. The power to dismiss an indictment on due process grounds on the basis of prosecutorial misconduct should be exercised sparingly. United States v. Busher, 817 F.2d 1409, 1411 (9th Cir.1987). Sparing use, of course, does not mean no use. Even disfavored remedies' must be used in certain situations. United States v. Omni Int'l Corp., 634 F.Supp. 1414, 1438 (D.Md.1986) (citation omitted). [7] The government contends that it did nothing wrong [6] and that the blame for any misconduct lies solely with Minkin. This court cannot agree. The government collaborated with Marshank's attorney to build a case against him, to effect his arrest, and to ensure that he would cooperate with the government rather than contest the charges against him. Marshank was first identified as a prospective target for criminal investigation as a result of information provided to the government by Minkin and two of his other clients. The government then actively worked with Minkin to develop a case against Marshank. 11 Government agents and AUSA Robinson used information supplied by Minkin to arrest Seth Booky, even though the government knew that Minkin had previously represented Booky and would most likely represent him on the charges which arose from Minkin's collaboration with the government. The government then used Booky as an informant to assist in the investigation of Marshank, despite the fact that the government was aware that Minkin had previously represented Marshank and would most likely represent him if he was charged with a crime as a result of the investigation in which Minkin and Booky participated. The government's decision to use Ron Minkin and Minkin's clients to develop a case against Steven Marshank created a conflict of interest between Minkin and Marshank. The 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 12 \f U.S. v. Marshank, 777 F.Supp. 1507 (1991) 60 USLW 2386 government was aware of this conflict and took advantage of it. The government did nothing to alert either the court or the defendant to the conflict of interest. It did nothing to alert Minkin, who was apparently oblivious, to any conflict. While the government may have no obligation to caution defense counsel against straying from the ethical path, it is not entitled to take advantage of conflicts of interest of which the defendant and the court are unaware. *1520 In this case, the government went so far as to participate in efforts to mask the conflict of interest from the defendant. The government was aware that Booky and Minkin solicited funds from Marshank and his associates, ostensibly to pay Booky's legal fees. Government agents taped and reviewed numerous conversations between Booky, Marshank and Marshank's associates discussing the legal fees needed for Booky's defense. Knowing that no defense was being mounted and that the legal fees were obtained by Minkin under false pretenses, the government did not seize the funds transferred from Marshank and his associates to Booky and Minkin, but allowed Minkin and his client to keep the money. Had Marshank been aware of Booky's decision to cooperate with the government, the defendant would have been alerted to Minkin's conflict of interest. Even after the defendant's arrest, the government did nothing to advise him of the conflict. Instead, the government colluded in the effort to hide the relationship between Minkin, Booky and the government by failing to inform Marshank of his attorney's role in his investigation. Worse yet, the record makes clear that the government plotted with Minkin to ensure Marshank's arrest and then steered Marshank in Minkin's direction to guarantee his cooperation. After obtaining the indictment against Marshank, Agent Ames called Minkin, who informed the government of Marshank's whereabouts. Ames then went to Florida to arrest Marshank. Minkin consulted with Agent Rasmussen after Marshank's arrest but before speaking with his client. Upon arresting Marshank, Agent Ames departed from standard procedure and encouraged Marshank to call a lawyer, knowing that the lawyer he contacted would be Minkin, that Minkin had provided the government with the information leading to Marshank's arrest, and that Minkin would do everything in his power to deliver Marshank's cooperation to the government. Although Agent Ames expressed concern to AUSA Robinson about the conflict of interest between Marshank and Minkin, neither the agent nor the prosecutor ever made Marshank or the court aware of this conflict. In light of the astonishing facts of this case, it is beyond question that Minkin's representation of Marshank was rendered completely ineffectual and that the government was a knowing participant in the circumstances that made the representation ineffectual. Minkin essentially turned Marshank over to the government in an effort to force him to cooperate. Indeed, as a result of the retainer agreement between Minkin and Booky, Minkin stood to gain millions of dollars if Marshank's property was seized as a result of his prosecution. Minkin's conduct during the post-arrest meeting between Marshank and the government suggests that he was attempting to worsen Marshank's position vis- a-vis the government in order to ensure that Marshank would cooperate. In this regard, Minkin advised Marshank to provide Agent Ames with incriminating information on the record and with no protection as a sign of good faith. It is clear to the court that Minkin's primary interest was to convince Marshank to cooperate with the government. After Marshank's arrest, Minkin attempted to engage the defendant's former wife in a scheme to tighten the noose around Marshank's neck and to persuade him to cooperate. When Marshank refused to cooperate, Minkin complained to Agent Rasmussen that Agent Ames had dropped the ball by not being heavy enough with Marshank. The government's knowledge that Minkin would attempt to induce Marshank to cooperate affected the timing of the first indictment. In a November 25, 1987 memo to then U.S. Attorney Joseph Russoniello, AUSA Mark Zanides, who took over the Marshank case from AUSA Robinson, recommended that the first indictment against Marshank be dismissed without prejudice because the evidence gathered was insufficient. Gov. In Camera Submission, Ex. II. In attempting to explain why the indictment had been sought and the defendant arrested in light of the weak case against him, Zanides observed that certain investigative *1521 steps necessary to corroborate a historical drug conspiracy were not undertaken, in part because the government expected that Marshank, when arrested, would cooperate with the government. Id. The government chose to indict and arrest Marshank without sufficient evidence to convict him because they believed that Minkin could ensure Marshank's cooperation. With the defendant's attorney in the government 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 13 \f U.S. v. Marshank, 777 F.Supp. 1507 (1991) 60 USLW 2386 camp, the strength of the government's case against Marshank became irrelevant. Under Irwin and Horowitz, interference with the attorney- client relationship is not enough, in and of itself, to constitute a due process violation. There must also be prejudice to the defendant. Irwin, 612 F.2d at 1187. Prejudice may manifest itself in a number of ways, including use of evidence gained through the interference, use by the prosecution of confidential information regarding defense plans and strategy, or destruction of the attorney-client relationship. Id. Prejudice may also result from other actions designed to give the prosecution an unfair advantage at trial. Id. It is clear that Marshank was prejudiced by the government misconduct in this case. First, the facts strongly suggest that, absent the government's improper interference with the relationship between Minkin and his clients, there would not have been any indictments against Marshank. Minkin, along with his clients Crawford and Ohlgart, identified Marshank to the government and were thus responsible for his becoming the target of criminal investigation in the first instance. Minkin and his client Seth Booky were instrumental in the pre-indictment investigation of Marshank. During the proceedings before the first grand jury, all three of the witnesses presenting testimony Seth Booky, Robert Wehe, and David Vandell were clients of Ron Minkin. Minkin and his clients were also integrally involved in the investigation which resulted in the instant indictment against the defendant. Minkin provided information to the government concerning Marshank on a consistent basis and testified against Marshank during the 1990 grand jury proceedings. Marshank was also prejudiced in numerous other ways. Evidence obtained through government misconduct was used against Marshank at every turn. The testimony of three of Minkin's clients before the grand jury demonstrates beyond question that the government marshalled the evidence provided by Minkin and his clients to obtain the first indictment. Minkin's cooperation with the government throughout the investigation leading to the instant indictment, his testimony against Marshank before the second grand jury, and the prominence of Seth Booky in the second indictment all lead inexorably to the conclusion that evidence obtained through government misconduct was used to obtain the second indictment against the defendant. It is also apparent that the government's misconduct in this case was designed to and would give the prosecution an unfair advantage at trial. The court need not retrace the source of the government's evidence against Marshank, other than to say that most, if not all of it, appears to have come directly or indirectly from Ron Minkin. Moreover, while he was in custody Marshank believed that he was being represented by counsel who was uncompromised. In fact, however, Marshank's attorney was in league with the government. Marshank was, for all intents and purposes, unrepresented during his post-arrest meetings with the government. The government took advantage of this situation to obtain incriminating information from Marshank and to engage in post-indictment, post-arrest communications with Marshank outside the presence of counsel. [9] Having found a Fifth Amendment violation under [8] Irwin, the court must decide the appropriate remedy. In making this determination, the court must tailor the remedy to the injury. United States v. Rogers, 751 F.2d 1074, 1078 (9th Cir.1985). The appropriate remedy for a Fifth Amendment violation is generally suppression of the evidence. Rogers, 751 F.2d at 1078. However, dismissal of the indictment is appropriate where continuing prejudice from *1522 the constitutional violation cannot be remedied by suppression of the evidence. United States v. Morrison, 449 U.S. 361, 365 66 n. 2, 101 S.Ct. 665, 669 n. 2, 66 L.Ed.2d 564 (1981); Rogers, 751 F.2d at 1078. [10] Suppression is an appropriate remedy where the court can identify and isolate the evidence obtained in violation of the defendant's Fifth Amendment due process rights. The prosecution is thus denied the fruits of its transgression and the due process right to a fair trial is preserved. Rogers, 751 F.2d at 1078. In the case at bar, however, the fruit of the prosecutor's transgression is the indictment itself. In such a situation, it is simply impossible to excise the taint of the government's constitutional transgressions from the prosecution of the defendant. The taint of the government's transgressions spreads to all the evidence obtained against Marshank. [11] Because of the bizarre circumstances surrounding the investigation and prosecution of the defendant, it is not surprising that neither the parties nor the court has been able to find case law based on facts similar to those found here. However, United States v. Schell, 775 F.2d 559 (4th 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 14 \f U.S. v. Marshank, 777 F.Supp. 1507 (1991) 60 USLW 2386 Cir.1985), cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1098, 106 S.Ct. 1498, 89 L.Ed.2d 898 (1986), is persuasive as to the appropriate remedy. In Schell, Jividen, a criminal defense attorney, briefly represented Wilson and Cain, both of whom had been subpoenaed to testify before a grand jury investigating the Gallo drug organization. Several months later, Jividen was hired as an Assistant U.S. Attorney. Jividen informed the U.S. Attorney of his previous representation of Wilson and Cain, and as a result Jividen was not allowed to participate in any way in the gathering of evidence against or prosecution of his former clients. Schell, 775 F.2d at 563. However, in his capacity as Assistant U.S. Attorney, Jividen appeared in front of a different grand jury investigating the Gallo drug organization. Jividen's former clients testified before one grand jury and Jividen appeared before another one. Schell, 775 F.2d at 563 n. 2. Wilson and Cain were subsequently indicted along with numerous other alleged members of the drug organization. Both defendants moved to dismiss their indictments on the grounds that Jividen's participation in the grand jury proceeding violated their due process rights. In Schell the government argued that it had engaged in no impropriety, pointing out that Jividen's participation had been limited to prosecution of other members of the drug organization and that the AUSA had been excluded from work on the cases against Wilson and Cain. The prosecution further maintained that Jividen did not possess any confidential information with respect to his former clients. Rejecting the government's argument, the court observed: Assuming that all of the government's assertions are true, the fact remains that Jividen represented Wilson and Cain with respect to the very same criminal activity which led to the indictment that he ultimately helped to prosecute and under which Wilson and Cain were convicted. Schell, 775 F.2d at 565. The court then dismissed the indictments against Wilson and Cain, holding that due process is violated when an attorney represents a client and then participates in the prosecution of that client with respect to the same matter. Schell, 775 F.2d at 566. While Ron Minkin was never hired by the U.S. Attorney's office he participated in the prosecution of his own client far more than did the attorney in Schell. The government in this case not only took no precautions to separate Minkin's work with the government from the investigation and prosecution of the defendant, but relied on Minkin to build a case against the defendant. As the Schell court pointed out: joins in lawyer The relationship between an attorney and his client is a sacred one. In that relationship, the client must be secure in the knowledge that any information he reveals to counsel will remain confidential. The confidentiality of the attorney-client relationship is severely compromised, if not destroyed, when, after representing a client, a the criminal *1523 prosecution of that client with respect to the identical matter about which the attorney originally counseled the client. Such switching of sides is fundamentally unfair and inherently prejudicial. Without question, the client's right to a fair trial, secured by the due process clauses of the fifth and fourteenth amendments, is compromised under these circumstances. Schell, 775 F.2d at 565. In this case, even more than in Schell, the defendant's due process right to a fair trial has been compromised by the government's interference in the attorney-client relationship. As discussed above, the taint of the government's constitutional transgression infected every part of the investigation and prosecution of the defendant. There is no means other than dismissal of the indictment to remedy the due process violation which occurred. Morrison, 449 U.S. at 366 n. 2, 101 S.Ct. at 668 n. 2; Rogers, 751 F.2d at 1078. The indictment is, therefore, DISMISSED. B.

To constitute a Fifth Amendment violation under Russell, the government conduct at issue must be fundamentally unfair and shocking to the universal sense of justice, mandated by the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Russell, 411 U.S. at 432, 93 S.Ct. at 1643 (quoting Kinsella v. United States, 361 U.S. 234, 246, 80 S.Ct. 297, 304, 4 L.Ed.2d 268 (1960)). such a reaches demonstrable [13] [T]he determination of when the government's behavior level of outrageousness' to constitute a due process violation is at best elusive.

(en banc), cert. denied, 457 U.S. 1106, 102 S.Ct. 2906, 73 L.Ed.2d 1315 (1982)). Therefore, every case must be resolved on its facts. Bogart, 783 F.2d at 1438. Whether outrageous government misconduct exists turns on the totality of the circumstances. United States v. Tobias, 662 F.2d 381, 387 (5th Cir.1981), cert. denied, 457 U.S. 1108, 102 S.Ct. 2908, 73 L.Ed.2d 1317 (1982). [14] In United States v. Batres Santolino, 521 F.Supp. 744, 750 53 (N.D.Cal.1981), Russell was invoked to dismiss an indictment resulting from outrageous government misconduct which induced the defendant to commit a crime. See also Bogart, 783 F.2d at 1434 38 (discussing the history of the doctrine's evolution and application). However, because the Russell doctrine is grounded in the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment, it may be applied in cases where government interference in an attorney-client relationship is so shocking to the universal sense of justice that it violates due process. See United States v. Ofshe, 817 F.2d 1508, 1516 (11th Cir.1987). [15] The prosecution's argument that its actions were not improper because only Minkin engaged in misconduct is unpersuasive. The Ninth Circuit has distinguished between the government's passive tolerance of misconduct and conscious direction by government agents, suggesting that the former is less egregious and therefore tempers the outrageousness of any government misconduct. Simpson I, 813 F.2d at 1468. In Simpson I, a prostitute working as a government informant developed a sexual relationship with the defendant and then helped to arrange a drug transaction between the defendant and undercover agents. Although the government agent on the case eventually learned of the sexual relationship, he did nothing to encourage the informant to use sex to *1524 carry out her assignment and in fact instructed the informant on numerous occasions to refrain from engaging in sexual activity with the defendant. Id. at 1467 68. Emphasizing the unique facts of the case, the court ruled that the government's conduct was not so outrageous as to shock the conscience. Id. at 1468. The government's actions in this case are far more egregious than the passive tolerance of impropriety in Simpson I. As the court's findings of fact illustrate, the government actively collaborated with Ron Minkin to build a case against the defendant, showing a complete lack of respect for the constitutional rights of the defendant and Minkin's other clients and an utter disregard for the government's ethical obligations. Unlike the government agent in Simpson I, the agents and prosecutor here never warned Minkin not to engage in unethical behavior and in fact facilitated that behavior by hiding it from the defendant. Moreover, the government colluded with Minkin to obtain an indictment against the defendant, to arrest the defendant, to ensure that Minkin would represent the defendant despite his obvious conflict of interest, and to guarantee the defendant's cooperation with the government. The government conduct in this case was anything but passive. to the universal sense of The government misconduct in this case, was also outrageous justice. 12 and shocking The government investigated Marshank using information received from his own attorney. All of the witnesses who testified before the first grand jury were Minkin's clients and had been made available to the government through Minkin. In addition, Minkin himself testified before the second grand jury. The government informed neither Booky nor Marshank of Minkin's cooperation with law enforcement authorities and the obvious conflict of interest this created. Nor did government attorneys, who are officers of the court, inform the courts presiding over the prosecutions of Booky and Marshank of the conflict of interest between Minkin and 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Having considered the totality of the circumstances, the court concludes that the conduct of the government in the investigation and prosecution of Steven Marshank was so outrageous that it shocked the universal sense of justice. Because the government's conduct was fundamentally unfair, the indictment is DISMISSED. II. Sixth Amendment The defendant contends that the government created a conflict of interest between himself and his attorney which denied him his Sixth Amendment right to counsel. The government denies that it engaged in any misconduct. The government further contends that even if any misconduct did occur, it did not taint the 1990 indictment. Moreover, the government claims that the attorney-client relationship between Minkin and Marshank was invalid because Marshank consulted Minkin in order to carry out illegal activity. Finally, the government contends that Marshank waived the conflict of interest between himself and Minkin by agreeing to pay Seth Booky's legal fees. The right to counsel is indispensable to the [17] [16] fair administration of our adversarial system of criminal justice. Maine v. Moulton, 474 U.S. 159, 168 69, 106 S.Ct. 477, 483, 88 L.Ed.2d 481 (1985). The Ninth Circuit has recognized that government misconduct may have a devastating *1525 effect on a defendant's Sixth Amendment right to counsel. United States v. Owen, 580 F.2d 365, 367 (9th Cir.1978). Indeed, government interference with a defendant's relationship with his attorney may render that attorney's assistance ineffective and thus violate the Sixth Amendment. United States v. Irwin, 612 F.2d at 1185. The Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel includes the right to be represented by counsel whose loyalties are undivided. United States v. Partin, 601 F.2d 1000, 1006 (9th Cir.1979), cert. denied, 446 U.S. 964, 100 S.Ct. 2939, 64 L.Ed.2d 822 (1980). See also Cuyler v. Sullivan, 446 U.S. 335, 348, 100 S.Ct. 1708, 1718, 64 L.Ed.2d 333 (1980). defendant's Sixth Amendment rights are violated only when the government intrusion results in prejudice to the defendant. Id. at 1187. Prejudice may manifest itself in numerous ways, including destruction of the attorney-client relationship. Id. at 1187, 1188 89. [20] As with a Fifth Amendment violation, a violation [19] of the Sixth Amendment requires a remedy tailored to the injury suffered. Morrison, 449 U.S. at 364, 101 S.Ct. at 667; Rogers, 751 F.2d at 1078. Once again, in most cases suppression of the evidence, rather than dismissal, is the appropriate remedy. Morrison, 449 U.S. at 365 66, 366 n. 3, 101 S.Ct. at 668, 669 n. 3; Rogers, 751 F.2d at 1078. However dismissal is appropriate where there is continuing prejudice from a constitutional violation that cannot be remedied by suppression of the evidence. Morrison, 449 U.S. at 365 66 n. 2, 101 S.Ct. at 669 n. 2; Rogers, 751 F.2d at 1078. [21] The prosecution's argument that it engaged in no misconduct is unconvincing because the Supreme Court has explicitly recognized the government's affirmative obligation not to subvert the Sixth Amendment right to counsel. In Maine v. Moulton, the Court stated: Once the right to counsel has attached and been asserted, the State must of course honor it. This means more than simply that the State cannot prevent the accused from obtaining the assistance of counsel. The Sixth Amendment also imposes on the State an affirmative obligation to respect and preserve the accused's choice to seek this assistance. We ... have made clear that, at the very least, the prosecutor and police have an affirmative obligation not to act in a manner that circumvents and thereby dilutes the protection afforded by the right to counsel. 474 U.S. at 170 71, 176, 106 S.Ct. at 484, 487 (emphasis added). Whether government action violates a defendant's right to the assistance of counsel is to be determined in light of this affirmative obligation. Id. [18] Not all government interference constitutes a Sixth Amendment violation. Irwin, 612 F.2d at 1186 87. A 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 17 \f U.S. v. Marshank, 777 F.Supp. 1507 (1991) 60 USLW 2386 [22] Considering the government's collaboration with Ron Minkin in the investigation, arrest and prosecution of the defendant after his September 1987 indictment, it is beyond cavil that the government failed to fulfil its affirmative obligation as described in Moulton. There can be no question but that the government in this case circumvented and diluted the protections guaranteed to the defendant by the Sixth Amendment right to counsel. [23] The government maintains that even if it violated Marshank's Sixth Amendment rights in connection with the first indictment, the second indictment against Marshank remains untainted because it involves different charges. The prosecution correctly points out that the Sixth Amendment attaches only after judicial proceedings have been initiated against a defendant in a criminal case. Brewer v. Williams, 430 U.S. 387, 398, 97 S.Ct. 1232, 1239, 51 L.Ed.2d 424 (1977). However, the government errs in concluding that the defendant's first and second indictments necessarily represent two distinct prosecutions for the purposes of Sixth Amendment analysis. In United States v. Valencia, 541 F.2d 618, 622 (6th Cir.1976), the Sixth Circuit rejected an argument, similar to the one offered by the government here, that the *1526 defendant's Sixth Amendment rights had not been violated because the government interference was related to charges which had been dismissed and was unrelated to the subsequent indictment challenged by the defendant. However, the court ruled that dismissal of an indictment against a defendant does not bring an end to the prosecution of the defendant if the defendant is later reindicted on charges which grow out of the same dealings that were the subject of the [prior] charges. Valencia, 541 F.2d at 622. [24] The Valencia holding reflects the core principles of Sixth Amendment doctrine. The Sixth Amendment attaches after the initiation of judicial proceedings because it is at this point that the government has committed itself to prosecute, and ... the adverse positions of government and defendant have solidified. that faced a defendant with forces of organized society, and immersed in the prosecutorial finds himself It is then the intricacies of substantive and procedural criminal law. Kirby v. Illinois, 406 U.S. 682, 689, 92 S.Ct. 1877, 1882, 32 L.Ed.2d 411 (1972). Having engaged in prosecutorial misconduct the government may not evade the Sixth Amendment simply by dismissing the initial indictment and reindicting the defendant on charges stemming from the same investigation. To hold otherwise would allow the government to use its prosecutorial powers to eviscerate defendants' right to counsel. [25] Applying Valencia to the case at bar, the court concludes that the instant indictment is tainted by the government's violation of the defendant's Sixth Amendment right to counsel. The government's investigation of Steven Marshank revolved around an alleged historical conspiracy involving the importation and sale of marijuana and hashish. The first indictment charged the defendant with offenses that allegedly occurred early on in the conspiracy. The record reveals that the first indictment was dismissed in order to give the government the opportunity to gather additional evidence. The facts also show that the government investigation of the defendant was ongoing at the time the indictment was dismissed, and that the government had every intention of continuing the investigation against the defendant until it had sufficient evidence to reindict him. The Zanides Memorandum explained that in 1987 the government had not gathered sufficient evidence to support a historical drug conspiracy prosecution. Gov. In Camera Submission, Ex. II at 2. In addition, AUSA Zanides complained that the charges against Marshank in the first indictment were too narrow to reflect the defendant's alleged degree of involvement in drug trafficking. Zanides therefore outlined a plan for the continued investigation of Marshank in order to broaden the charges in a second indictment. Id. at 3 4. Following-up on information provided by the cooperating defendants, Minkin's cooperating clients, was central to this plan. Id. In the months following the dismissal of the first indictment, Minkin remained in frequent contact with government agents so as to assist them in the investigation of Marshank. He arranged a meeting between government agents and his cooperating clients, Ohlgart and Crawford, to encourage the continued cooperation of the two men in the 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 18 \f U.S. v. Marshank, 777 F.Supp. 1507 (1991) 60 USLW 2386 investigation. Minkin had numerous telephone conversations with government agents regarding the investigation leading up to the second indictment of Marshank. Indeed, Minkin's participation in the investigation of Marshank did not end until the defendant filed this motion to dismiss and AUSA Howden advised government agents to cease communication with Minkin. The proceedings before the second grand jury show that Minkin's client Seth Booky was the government's key witness against the defendant. Booky's testimony took up a substantial portion of the proceedings and was the foundation upon which the government built its case against Marshank. See Grand Jury 87 4, Testimony of Seth Booky, July 17, 1988; Grand Jury 89 3, Testimony of Paul Rozairo (reading testimony of Booky), December 14, 1989; Grand Jury 89 3, Testimony of Dan McCurrie *1527 (reading testimony of Booky), January 11, 1990; Grand Jury 89 3, Testimony of Seth Booky, March 15, 1990. The second indictment was, unquestionably, a result of the government's ongoing investigation of Marshank, which began in 1986, prior to the first indictment. The overt acts alleged in the second indictment primarily involved illegal activity which Marshank and Seth Booky engaged in together. Indeed, the record of the second grand jury proceedings makes it clear that Booky was the source of virtually all of the allegations of overt acts. Booky was the source of every act for which a source was identified. Grand Jury 89 3, Testimony of Robert Heng, July 26, 1990, at 43 44, 46 49, 52, 54, 57, 73 74, 77 78, 80, 81. The testimony of Agent Heng strongly suggests that, with the exception of two acts of which Booky had no knowledge, Booky was the source for each of the forty-four overt acts in which it is alleged that the defendant participated. 13 Booky's prominence is so striking that one of the grand jurors expressed concern that the informant appeared to be the sole source of the government's charges. Testimony of Heng, at 19. Based on the proceedings before the second grand jury, the court concludes that there would have been no second indictment without Booky's cooperation with the government's investigation. In light of these facts, the court finds that the two indictments are, for purposes of Sixth Amendment analysis, part of the same prosecution of Marshank. [27] The government argues that the attorney- [28] [26] client relationship between Marshank and Minkin was invalid because the two were engaged in ongoing illegal activity. The government relies on In re Grand Jury Proceedings, 867 F.2d 539, 541 (9th Cir.1989), which holds that the attorney- client privilege is vitiated when a client consults an attorney for legal assistance in carrying out a crime. To establish a prima facie case for this, so-called crime-fraud exception to the attorney-client privilege, the government must rely on evidence independent of the communications between the client and the attorney. Id. In addition, where an attorney has represented a defendant in the same criminal matter in which the attorney is implicated, the crime-fraud exception does not thereby justify an abrogation of the privilege as to all dealings between the two, as attorney and client. United States v. Alexander, 736 F.Supp. 968, 1003 (D.Minn.1990). *1528 Where a defendant has had discussions with an attorney regarding his or her defense against criminal charges, those conversations are lawful and fall within the ambit of the attorney-client privilege even if there is evidence that the attorney participated in other illegal activity with the defendant. Valencia, 541 F.2d at 621. The government's argument for the crime-fraud exception to attorney-client privilege lacks merit for three reasons. First, while there is evidence in the record that Minkin may have been involved in criminal activity, it is not enough to establish a prima facie case that the defendant consulted with Minkin to complete a crime. 14 Second, discussions between Minkin and Marshank regarding criminal charges already facing the defendant do not fall within the crime- fraud exception. Valencia, 541 F.2d at 621; Alexander, 736 F.Supp. at 1003. Third, the crime-fraud exception was simply not meant to be applied in the manner which the government attempts here. Because the attorney-client privilege is not to be used as a cloak for illegal or fraudulent behavior, it is well-established that the privilege does not apply where legal representation was secured in furtherance of intended, or present, continuing illegality. United States v. Hodge and Zweig, 548 F.2d 1347, 1354 (9th Cir.1977). The exception is to be considered where the government seeks disclosure of information regarding continuing illegality which would otherwise be covered by the attorney-client privilege. Id. The exception does not allow prosecutors to ignore altogether the attorney-client relationship. 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 19 \f Finally, the government's argument that [30] [31] U.S. v. Marshank, 777 F.Supp. 1507 (1991) 60 USLW 2386 [29] the defendant waived his conflict of interest with Marshank by paying Booky's legal fees is absolutely meritless. In situations where there is no conflict of interest, a defendant may waive his right to assistance of counsel; however, that waiver must be knowing and intelligent. See Partin, 601 F.2d at 1008. Where an attorney represents both a defendant and a government informant in the same case, the court must disclose the potential conflict of interest to the defendant on the record before there can be a knowing and intelligent waiver. United States v. Levy, 577 F.2d 200, 211 (3d Cir.1978) (citing Holloway v. Arkansas, 435 U.S. 475, 98 S.Ct. 1173, 55 L.Ed.2d 426 (1978)). Clearly, there was no knowing and intelligent waiver by the defendant in this case. Although Marshank was aware that Minkin was also representing Seth Booky, he had no knowledge of Booky's activities as a government informant or of Minkin's role in facilitating those activities. Indeed, Booky, Minkin and the government hid this information from Marshank. Nor did the court ever disclose the conflict of interest, as the government never informed the court of the joint representation of Booky and Marshank. As the government was aware that Minkin was using a front attorney in Booky's case to hide the conflict of interest problem from the court, the government's suggestion that the defendant somehow waived his Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel is simply galling. Therefore, the court finds that the indictment must be DISMISSED under the Sixth Amendment. A court may dismiss an indictment for [33] [34] III. Supervisory Power [32] prosecutorial misconduct either on constitutional grounds or by exercising its supervisory power. United States v. Carrasco, 786 F.2d 1452, 1455 (9th Cir.1986). The three legitimate bases for the exercise of the supervisory power are: (1) to remedy a violation of a statutory or constitutional right; (2) to preserve judicial integrity; and (3) to deter future illegal conduct. United States v. Simpson, 927 F.2d 1088, 1090 (9th Cir.1991) (Simpson II ). The court's supervisory power may be used to vindicate a defendant's rights, as well as to preserve judicial integrity and/or to deter illegal or improper conduct. *1529 United States v. Hasting, 461 U.S. 499, 505, 103 S.Ct. 1974, 1978, 76 L.Ed.2d 96 (1983); Carrasco, 786 F.2d at 1455. The supervisory power has frequently been used by federal courts as a means of sanctioning and deterring prosecutorial misconduct. 15 An important function of our supervisory power is to guarantee that federal prosecutors act with due regard for the integrity of the administration of justice. United States v. Basurto, 497 F.2d 781, 793 (9th Cir.1974) (Hufstedler, J., concurring). [35] It is well-established that a federal court may use its supervisory power to dismiss an indictment on the basis of government misconduct. United States v. Owen, 580 F.2d 365, 367 (9th Cir.1978). As such, dismissal is used as a prophylactic tool for discouraging future deliberate governmental impropriety of a similar nature. Id.; see also United States v. Samango, 607 F.2d 877, 884 (9th Cir.1979) (court exercising supervisory power to dismiss indictment where cumulative effect of errors and prosecutorial misconduct was to produce a biased grand jury); United States v. Isgro, 751 F.Supp. 846, 851 (C.D.Cal.1990) (court dismissing indictment because of prosecutorial misconduct before grand jury). While a court may use its supervisory power [37] [36] to dismiss an indictment, dismissal is, generally speaking, a disfavored remedy. Rogers, 751 F.2d at 1076 77. For this reason, a court may dismiss an indictment only in flagrant cases of prosecutorial misconduct. U.S. v. Jacobs, 855 F.2d 652, 655 (9th Cir.1988); Carrasco, 786 F.2d at 1455. However, since this standard is so vague that it fails to illuminate the applicable legal principles, and provides district judges who are called upon to apply it precious little guidance, U.S. v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., Inc., 719 F.2d 1386, 1391 n. 6 (9th Cir.1983), courts must determine when to exercise their supervisory power to dismiss an indictment on a case-by-case basis. United States v. De Rosa, 783 F.2d 1401, 1406 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 477 U.S. 908, 106 S.Ct. 3282, 91 L.Ed.2d 571 (1986). [38] To warrant dismissal, the government's misconduct must not only be flagrant, but must also have prejudiced the defendant. Bank of Nova Scotia v. United States, 487 U.S. 250, 254, 108 S.Ct. 2369, 2373, 101 L.Ed.2d 228 (1988). As the Supreme Court pointed out in Bank of Nova Scotia, 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 20 \f U.S. v. Marshank, 777 F.Supp. 1507 (1991) 60 USLW 2386 where the error is harmless, concerns about the integrity of the [judicial] process' will carry less weight. Id. at 255, 108 S.Ct. at 2374 (quoting United States v. Hasting, 461 U.S. at 506, 103 S.Ct. at 1979). [39] It is not necessary to review the government's conduct in this case yet again in order to determine whether it is appropriate for the court to exercise its supervisory power to dismiss the indictment against the defendant. The court invokes its supervisory power to dismiss the indictment in order to remedy the violation of the defendant's Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights, to preserve judicial integrity, and to deter future government misconduct. The court's previous discussion makes clear the need to remedy the violation of the defendant's constitutional rights and to deter future government misconduct. With regard to the preservation of judicial integrity, the court notes that Rule 3 310 of the Rules of Professional Conduct of the State Bar of California provides in pertinent part: (B) A member shall not concurrently represent clients whose interests conflict, except with their informed written consent. .... standards of professional conduct for the Northern District of California. 16 Rule 3 310 was violated in numerous instances by Ron Minkin. Judicial integrity is severely threatened when professional ethical and court rules such as those involved here are flouted by the government. The court, therefore, DISMISSES the indictment in the exercise of its supervisory power. 17 CONCLUSION The government in this case collaborated with the defendant's attorney in an effort to investigate, arrest and prosecute the defendant. This collaboration included using some of Minkin's other clients as government informants in the defendant's investigation. The government's misconduct in this case robbed the defendant of his right to effective assistance of counsel and his right to due process of law. The government's actions also displayed a complete disregard for the professional duty attorneys owe to their clients and for the ethical obligation prosecutors have as officers of the court. For these reasons the court DISMISSES the indictment against the defendant on Fifth Amendment grounds, Sixth Amendment grounds and as an exercise of the court's supervisory power. *1530 (F) As used in this rule informed means full disclosure to the client of the circumstances and advice to the client of any actual or reasonably foreseeable adverse effects of those circumstances upon the representation. This court, through its Local Rules, has adopted the State Bar's Rules of Professional Conduct as the applicable IT IS SO ORDERED.

Rasmussen is an attorney and has been a member of the Utah Bar since 1987. Booky became an active informant for the government and provided information leading to both the 1987 and the current indictment against Marshank. Minkin is Booky's attorney. AUSA Robinson was the prosecutor assigned to Booky's case. Yamashita was Agent Ames' supervisor beginning in early July 1987 and continuing throughout the investigation of the defendant. There are other discrepancies between the testimony of Robinson and Ames. For instance, Robinson testified that he did not know about the task force formed in Los Angeles to investigate the defendant or of the plan to use Booky as an 2 3 4 5 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 21 \f U.S. v. Marshank, 777 F.Supp. 1507 (1991) 60 USLW 2386 active informant. RT at 2 312 313, 319 321. Ames, however, testified that he told Robinson of the task force that was formed at the Los Angeles meetings. RT at 3 589. It is clear that either Ames or Robinson is not telling the truth. The court is hard pressed to believe that Ames, the case agent, would not have informed Robinson, the AUSA in charge of the case, of such important developments in the case. However, given that either version of the story reveals government complicity with Minkin, it unnecessary for the court to resolve the conflict between the witnesses' testimony. Booky, in his testimony before the second grand jury to indict Marshank, described the moments after his arrest and leading up to his decision to cooperate with the government as follows: 6 And they took us up to the Santa Rosa Courthouse, down to the police station down there, and everybody was in separate rooms. .... And they come in, close the door, and say, Hello, Mr. Booky, I'm Ed Ames and I'm Peter Robinson. They said We would like your help, Mr. Booky. We have this case dead to rights, but we know who you are, and we'd like your help. We'd like your cooperation, and you could make it easy on yourself if you help us now. They said, We're looking for forfeitures and there's a reward to be had and we're willing to offer those to you if you make a deal right now. We want your cooperation. I said, Look, I have to talk to my lawyer. I said, I'm not gonna say anything to you guys before I talk to my lawyer. So I thought that I'd get on the phone to my lawyer. His name's Ron Minkin. And I thought he'd tell me, Seth, don't say anything. Because that's what he told me before, because that's what he told me in Hawaii, and that's the general procedure. .... But I get on the phone to Ron, and he says, Seth, he says, look, there's a lot you don't know. He says, I know a lot you don't know, but I gotta tell you, you're in big trouble and you got no choice. He says, Seth, your life is over. He says, You've got to cooperate with the government. Now this came to me I'm saying, What? I know this guy. He's a lawyer. He's a criminal defense lawyer. .... I says, What are you talking about? He says, Don't ask me. He says, As a friend and as your lawyer, you have no choice. And I said, But, Ron, I only got caught I only got 15 pounds in the car. He says, Seth, you got no choice. You've gotta make up your mind right now. From the tone of his voice, there was more to it than I knew. There was just more to it. And knowing him as being a friend, I knew he cared about me personally, other than a lawyer/client relationship. He just left me with no options. And right then and there, I made up my mind. Yeah, he says, look Ron says to me, he says, Look, Seth, I'll make you the best deal I can. He says, There's rewards that you can have if you lead these guys to forfeitures. He says, You won't do any time. He says it like he already had made this deal. And I So he says, Let me talk to those guys, meaning Ames and Robinson. So he gets on the phone with Ames and Robinson, and I hear half the conversations, you know. You know, I coudn't [sic] hear Ron, but I could hear their end.

Grand Jury Proceedings, Testimony of Seth Booky, March 15, 1990, at 298 32. Minkin and Booky have brought an action against the government for monies to which they claim they are entitled as a result of Booky's cooperation in the Marshank investigation and the representation agreement between Booky and Minkin. RT at 3 657. Contrary to the testimony of Agent Ames, Robinson testified that he did not know that the defendant provided money to Minkin for Booky's ostensible defense. The former AUSA testified that had he known about the funds he would not have allowed Minkin to keep the money. For the same reasons stated in Note five, the court need not resolve this conflicting testimony. RT at 2 296 297. Robinson testified that although he spoke to Ames in Florida after Marshank was arrested, the two men never discussed Minkin's potential conflict of interest. RT at 2 307. Once again, there is no need to resolve the discrepancy between the testimony of Robinson and the government agent. The government produced notes taken by agents in conjunction with many of these calls. The notes provide information regarding the following: 1) calls by Minkin to Yamashita on October 31, 1987, November 9, 1987, November 11, 1987, November 18, 1987, November 25, 1987, January 6, 1988, and July 17, 1989. Def. Ex. O. There are also ten pages of undated notes written by Yamashita. 2) calls by Minkin to Heng on August 22, 1989 and March 19, 1990. There are also several pages of undated notes by Heng. The government attempts to distinguish the evidence provided to it by Minkin from that provided by his cooperating clients, arguing that only the former is potentially violative of the defendant's constitutional rights. However, the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine applies to evidence obtained in violation of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel as well as the Fifth Amendment right to due process. U.S. v. Terzado Madruga, 897 F.2d 1099, 1113 (11th Cir.1990) (citing U.S. v. Wade, 388 U.S. 218, 87 S.Ct. 1926, 18 L.Ed.2d 1149 (1967) and Kastigar v. U.S., 406 U.S. 441, 92 S.Ct. 1653, 32 L.Ed.2d 212 (1972)). Therefore, the exclusionary doctrine applies to any incriminating evidence derived from primary evidence obtained in violation of a defendant's Fifth or Sixth Amendment rights. In light of the fact that the cooperation of Minkin's clients was a direct result of Minkin's collaboration with the government, use of evidence obtained from these government informants against Marshank must be deemed violative of the defendant's constitutional rights. Even members of the grand jury hearing Minkin's testimony in connection with the second indictment had some concerns about Minkin's dual role. One grand juror asked Didn't you feel that you worked for the government by giving the information from A to B? Grand Jury 89 3, Testimony of Ron Minkin, June 28, 1990, at 44. Apparently the Grand jury was not satisfied with the answer because once again a grand juror asked, So you acted as a government agent by making sure Mr. Marshank would cooperate and he would be flown home immediately? Id. at 45. However, before Minkin could answer the AUSA interrupted and the first part of the question was never answered. Of the thirteen witnesses to appear before the second grand jury in addition to Booky and Minkin, two (Paul Rozario and Dan McCurrie) were government agents reading previous testimony of Booky and two (Maura McNulty and Robert Heng) were government agents relaying information obtained either from Booky or Scott Alexander Moffett. Moffett testified before the grand jury and retracted any statements he made previously concerning Marshank, stating that he had given false information to the government under pressure and in the hopes of receiving a lighter sentence for a drug conviction. Grand Jury 89 3, Testimony of Moffett, at 21 22, 42. Also appearing were Norman Jay Marshank, the defendant's father; Charles Laver of the Sonoma County Sheriff's Department; John Matheson; Wendy Rothcopf; Kenneth Schatzberg; Burt McCumber; Joseph Cooper; and Thomis Larson. Norman Marshank provided no incriminating information concerning the defendant, Grand Jury 89 3, Testimony of Norman Marshank; Laver testified that he knew nothing about Marshank other than rumors he had heard, Grand Jury 89 3, Testimony of Laver, at 14; Rothcopf testified only that she had met the defendant socially three or four times, Grand Jury 89 3, Testimony of Rothcopf, at 13; McCumber testified that he had never met the defendant and did not recognize Marshank's name, Grand Jury 89 3, Testimony of McCumber, at 32; and Larson provided no testimony concerning the defendant, Grand Jury 89 3, Testimony of Larson. Matheson, Schatzberg and Cooper did provide some incriminating information concerning Marshank. However, it appears that only the information supplied by Schatzberg, who was identified to the government by Booky, Grand Jury 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 23 \f U.S. v. Marshank, 777 F.Supp. 1507 (1991) 60 USLW 2386 14 15 16 17 89 3, Testimony of Heng, at 73, made its way into the second indictment. See Second Indictment of Steven Marshank, Overt Acts, para. 31. The overt act contained in the second indictment and testified to by Schatzberg involved a drug transaction between Booky and Schatzberg; the government learned of this transaction from Booky. Grand Jury 89 3, Testimony of Heng. It thus appears that the government relied almost exclusively on Booky in formulating its second indictment against Marshank. Matheson, Schatzberg and Cooper are seemingly extras who may have been included in the grand jury proceedings by the government to mask the prosecution's reliance on Booky. Indeed, if there was evidence of Minkin's involvement in criminal activity with Marshank, it is curious that the government never undertook to investigate or prosecute Minkin. The supervisory power has been used by courts in many contexts, including to reverse a conviction supported by false evidence, Mesarosh v. United States, 352 U.S. 1, 14, 77 S.Ct. 1, 8, 1 L.Ed.2d 1 (1956); to punish improper practices by federal attorneys, United States v. Hale, 422 U.S. 171, 180 & n. 7, 95 S.Ct. 2133, 2138 & n. 7, 45 L.Ed.2d 99 (1975); United States v. Banks, 383 F.Supp. 389, 397 (D.S.D.1974), appeal dismissed sub nom. United States v. Means, 513 F.2d 1329 (8th Cir.1975); and to suppress evidence gained by government agents through misconduct. Mallory v. United States, 354 U.S. 449, 455 56, 77 S.Ct. 1356, 1359 60, 1 L.Ed.2d 1479 (1957); Rea v. United States, 350 U.S. 214, 217 18, 76 S.Ct. 292, 294, 100 L.Ed. 233 (1956). U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, Local Rule 110 3. In determining if government actions are sufficiently egregious to warrant dismissal as a means of deterring future misconduct, courts often have been guided by two considerations. First, courts have looked to whether there is a pattern of similar government misconduct, on the theory that such widespread misconduct increases the threat to judicial integrity. See, e.g., United States v. Griffith, 756 F.2d 1244, 1249 (6th Cir.1985), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 837, 106 S.Ct. 114, 88 L.Ed.2d 93 (1985); United States v. Rosenfield, 780 F.2d 10, 11 (3d Cir.1985), cert. denied, 478 U.S. 1004, 106 S.Ct. 3294, 92 L.Ed.2d 709 (1986). Second, courts have looked to whether there is any alternative remedy which the court may effectively use as a means of deterrence. Bank of Nova Scotia, 487 U.S. at 255, 108 S.Ct. at 2374; Simpson II, 927 F.2d at 1091 92 (Nelson, J., concurring). Because the court invokes its supervisory power in part to remedy the violation of the defendant's constitutional rights, and in part because it has already been determined that nothing short of dismissal will remedy this violation, the court need not consider the extent to which the government's misconduct here is part of a larger pattern.

Before SETH, Chief Judge, and HOLLOWAY and McKAY, Circuit Judges. Opinion SETH, Chief Judge. This Abney appeal is taken from denial of a motion to bar retrial based on the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment. The only issue is whether the prosecutor's behavior during the first trial constituted deliberate misconduct intended to provoke a mistrial motion and whether the double jeopardy clause is thus invoked to bar retrial. See United States v. Dinitz, 424 U.S. 600, 96 S.Ct. 1075, 47 L.Ed.2d 267. Defendant Rios at his first trial was convicted by a jury of possession of heroin with intent to distribute. Defense counsel moved for a mistrial after the prosecution's closing argument urging that improper remarks had prejudiced the defendant. The motion was denied. 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 1 \f U.S. v. Rios, 637 F.2d 728 (1980) We reversed the conviction in United States v. Rios, 611 F.2d 1335 (10th Cir.), because prosecutorial misconduct prevented a fair trial. Defendant moved at his second trial to bar retrial based on double jeopardy. An *729 evidentiary hearing was held on the issue, and the motion was denied. This appeal followed. This case is somewhat different from the Dinitz line of cases in which prosecutorial misconduct actually caused a mistrial to be granted in the trial court. Here, the mistrial motion was denied. The same procedural situation was however presented to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in Commonwealth v. Potter, 478 Pa. 251, 386 A.2d 918. See also the comment, The Double Jeopardy Clause and Mistrials Granted on Defendant's Motion: What Kind of Prosecutorial Misconduct Precludes Reprosecution? 18 Duquesne L.Rev. 103 (1979). Although equally divided on the final judgment, the majority of the justices in Potter concluded that reversal of a conviction for prosecutorial misconduct after a mistrial has been denied should be treated the same for purposes of double jeopardy analysis as if the mistrial had been granted in the first instance, and said: in [1] We conclude that double jeopardy considerations applicable after a mistrial has been granted are indeed the same manner when prosecutorial applicable misconduct requires reversal of a conviction for lack of a fair trial after a mistrial motion has been denied. We have dealt with the standard for retrial after a mistrial is caused by prosecutorial misconduct in United States v. Leonard, 593 F.2d 951, 954 (10th Cir.). We there stated: The Double Jeopardy Clause does protect a defendant against governmental actions intended to provoke mistrial requests and thereby to subject defendants to the substantial burdens imposed by multiple prosecutions. It bars retrials where bad-faith conduct by judge or prosecutor, United States v. Jorn, supra, at (400 U.S. 470) 485, (91 S.Ct. 547 at 557, 27 L.Ed.2d 543) threatens the (h) arassment of an accused by successive prosecutions or declaration of a mistrial so as to afford the prosecution a more favorable opportunity to convict the defendant. See also our United States v. Brooks, 599 F.2d 943, 945 (10th Cir.): As we have noted, appellant's mistrial motions during the course of the second trial were denied, but were later deemed meritorious by the court en banc, with the result that a new trial was awarded. The question then arises whether the fact that a new trial was the result of a decision by a reviewing court rather than the declaration of a mistrial by the trial judge requires that the exceptions to the Ball principle cannot be considered. We think not; a distinction between granting a new trial at the urging of a defendant and ordering a mistrial at his request is without significance for double jeopardy purposes. Recent cases in the Supreme Court of the United States have emphasized that in the field of federal criminal practice the applicability of double jeopardy analysis is not dependent on nice procedural distinctions. In Dinitz, the Supreme Court held that a request by a defendant for a mistrial ordinarily removes any barrier to his reprosecution, even if the request is prompted by prosecutorial or judicial error. Under Dinitz, the only exception to the general rule is where bad faith conduct by the judge or prosecutor threatens harassment of an accused by successive prosecution so as to afford the prosecution a more favorable opportunity to convict. Accord, United States v. Clayborne, 584 F.2d 346 (10th Cir.); United States v. Nelson, 582 F.2d 1246 (10th Cir.); United States v. Rumpf, 576 F.2d 818 (10th Cir.); United States v. Buzzard, 540 F.2d 1383 (10th Cir.). [2] Thus (t)he Double Jeopardy Clause does protect a defendant against governmental actions intended to provoke mistrial requests and thereby to subject defendants to the substantial burdens imposed by multiple prosecutions. United States v. Scott, 437 U.S. 82, 94, 98 S.Ct. 2187, 2195, 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 2 \f U.S. v. Rios, 637 F.2d 728 (1980) 57 L.Ed.2d 65, citing United States v. Dinitz, 424 U.S. at 611, 96 S.Ct. at 1081. [3] Under this standard, retrial is allowable here because the record demonstrates that the prosecutor did not intend to cause *730 a mistrial request to further the chances of conviction. The trial court so found. At the hearing on the motion to bar reprosecution, the prosecutor testified that he definitely did not want to retry the case for several reasons. The trial court found no action by the prosecution was intended to cause a mistrial, and the evidence supports this finding. Although such prosecutorial misconduct is not to be condoned, bad faith in the abstract does not help the defendant in any event. It must be bad faith, the impact of which provokes a mistrial request. United States v. Leonard, 593 F.2d 951, 954 (10th Cir.). We cannot conclude under the circumstances revealed in the record that provoking a mistrial request was a motive of the prosecutor. The record instead indicates that a very strong case had been made against the defendant, that government witnesses might not be again available, and that no purpose would have been served by forcing a mistrial in order to enhance the prosecution's opportunity for conviction at another trial. AFFIRMED. McKAY, Circuit Judge, dissenting: In Lee v. United States, 432 U.S. 23, 97 S.Ct. 2141, 52 L.Ed.2d 80 (1977), the Supreme Court characterized the rule laid down in United States v. Dinitz, 424 U.S. 600, 96 S.Ct. 1075, 47 L.Ed.2d 267 (1976), as follows: (T)here was no double jeopardy barrier to petitioner's retrial unless the judicial or prosecutorial error that prompted petitioner's motion was intended to provoke the motion or was otherwise motivated by bad faith or undertaken to harass or prejudice petitioner. 432 U.S. at 33-34, 97 S.Ct. at 2147 (quoting United States v. Dinitz, 424 U.S. at 611, 96 S.Ct. at 1081) (emphasis added). The Court's failure to find a double jeopardy violation in Lee was based on the majority's conclusion that the prosecution's conduct did not evidence bad faith. That element has been supplied here by our own decision in the previous appeal of this case, United States v. Rios, 611 F.2d 1335 (10th Cir. 1979). There we effectively held that the prosecutor's comments constituted gross prosecutorial misconduct: The effect of these assertions before the jury was that defense counsel's investigator was clearly charged with contriving the defense testimony, with no factual basis to justify such a serious charge. Similar comments have been condemned by this court recently in United States v. Siviglia, No. 76-1914 (10th Cir. 6/5/78) (unpublished). There counsel argued that a witness had lied because defense counsel had told him to do so. We emphatically stated (slip op. 33-34): We hold and conclude that the prosecutor's comments constituted gross prosecutorial misconduct requiring reversal of Siviglia's conviction .... Second, there were remarks clearly directed at the appellant in the closing rebuttal, drawing an inference that appellant had threatened the safety of the Vega brothers who were testifying against him. There was no evidence linking the appellant to any such threats to the Vegas and the innuendo was unfounded and unfair.... Third, there was a strong statement of the prosecuting attorney's conclusion that the appellant was a large dealer in heroin.... We must agree that the effect of this rebuttal argument was to impress the jury with the prosecuting attorney's personal conclusion that the appellant was guilty. Such remarks expressing the personal opinion of the prosecuting attorney have been emphatically disapproved.... ...In such a case, with so much riding on the credibility of the appellant, and in view of the errors discussed, we must hold that the prosecutorial misconduct was prejudicial error which denied appellant a fair trial. *731 United States v. Rios, 611 F.2d 1335, 1342-43 (10th Cir. 1979) (footnotes and citations omitted). Such conduct is, in my opinion, tantamount to bad faith. To suggest that the double jeopardy clause is not violated unless the defendant can show (presumably only through the prosecutor's confession) that the subjective purpose of the prosecutor was to obtain a mistrial invites the prosecution to 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 3 \f U.S. v. Rios, 637 F.2d 728 (1980) go as far as it wishes, knowing that the only sanction it faces is a new trial. Such a conclusion offends the spirit of Dinitz and Lee and the requirements of the double jeopardy clause. Any suggestion to the contrary in our previous cases, see United States v. Leonard, 593 F.2d 951 (10th Cir. 1979), should not be followed. End of Document 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 2015 Thomson Reuters.

RIOS, Defendant-Appellant. No. 80-1406. | Argued and Submitted July 10, 1980. | Decided Nov. 14, 1980. | Rehearing Denied Jan. 12, 1980. Defendant, whose conviction had been reversed for lack of fair trial after a mistrial motion had been denied him, 611 F.2d 1335, appealed from denial by the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico, Edwin L. Mechem, J., of his motion to bar retrial on basis of double jeopardy. The Court of Appeals, Seth, Chief Judge, held that retrial of defendant was not barred where prosecutor did not intend to cause a mistrial request to further chances of conviction. Affirmed. McKay, Circuit Judge, dissented and filed opinion.

Before SETH, Chief Judge, and HOLLOWAY and McKAY, Circuit Judges. Opinion SETH, Chief Judge. This Abney appeal is taken from denial of a motion to bar retrial based on the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment. The only issue is whether the prosecutor's behavior during the first trial constituted deliberate misconduct intended to provoke a mistrial motion and whether the double jeopardy clause is thus invoked to bar retrial. See United States v. Dinitz, 424 U.S. 600, 96 S.Ct. 1075, 47 L.Ed.2d 267. Defendant Rios at his first trial was convicted by a jury of possession of heroin with intent to distribute. Defense counsel moved for a mistrial after the prosecution's closing argument urging that improper remarks had prejudiced the defendant. The motion was denied. 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 1 \f U.S. v. Rios, 637 F.2d 728 (1980) We reversed the conviction in United States v. Rios, 611 F.2d 1335 (10th Cir.), because prosecutorial misconduct prevented a fair trial. Defendant moved at his second trial to bar retrial based on double jeopardy. An *729 evidentiary hearing was held on the issue, and the motion was denied. This appeal followed. This case is somewhat different from the Dinitz line of cases in which prosecutorial misconduct actually caused a mistrial to be granted in the trial court. Here, the mistrial motion was denied. The same procedural situation was however presented to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in Commonwealth v. Potter, 478 Pa. 251, 386 A.2d 918. See also the comment, The Double Jeopardy Clause and Mistrials Granted on Defendant's Motion: What Kind of Prosecutorial Misconduct Precludes Reprosecution? 18 Duquesne L.Rev. 103 (1979). Although equally divided on the final judgment, the majority of the justices in Potter concluded that reversal of a conviction for prosecutorial misconduct after a mistrial has been denied should be treated the same for purposes of double jeopardy analysis as if the mistrial had been granted in the first instance, and said: in [1] We conclude that double jeopardy considerations applicable after a mistrial has been granted are indeed the same manner when prosecutorial applicable misconduct requires reversal of a conviction for lack of a fair trial after a mistrial motion has been denied. We have dealt with the standard for retrial after a mistrial is caused by prosecutorial misconduct in United States v. Leonard, 593 F.2d 951, 954 (10th Cir.). We there stated: The Double Jeopardy Clause does protect a defendant against governmental actions intended to provoke mistrial requests and thereby to subject defendants to the substantial burdens imposed by multiple prosecutions. It bars retrials where bad-faith conduct by judge or prosecutor, United States v. Jorn, supra, at (400 U.S. 470) 485, (91 S.Ct. 547 at 557, 27 L.Ed.2d 543) threatens the (h) arassment of an accused by successive prosecutions or declaration of a mistrial so as to afford the prosecution a more favorable opportunity to convict the defendant. See also our United States v. Brooks, 599 F.2d 943, 945 (10th Cir.): As we have noted, appellant's mistrial motions during the course of the second trial were denied, but were later deemed meritorious by the court en banc, with the result that a new trial was awarded. The question then arises whether the fact that a new trial was the result of a decision by a reviewing court rather than the declaration of a mistrial by the trial judge requires that the exceptions to the Ball principle cannot be considered. We think not; a distinction between granting a new trial at the urging of a defendant and ordering a mistrial at his request is without significance for double jeopardy purposes. Recent cases in the Supreme Court of the United States have emphasized that in the field of federal criminal practice the applicability of double jeopardy analysis is not dependent on nice procedural distinctions. In Dinitz, the Supreme Court held that a request by a defendant for a mistrial ordinarily removes any barrier to his reprosecution, even if the request is prompted by prosecutorial or judicial error. Under Dinitz, the only exception to the general rule is where bad faith conduct by the judge or prosecutor threatens harassment of an accused by successive prosecution so as to afford the prosecution a more favorable opportunity to convict. Accord, United States v. Clayborne, 584 F.2d 346 (10th Cir.); United States v. Nelson, 582 F.2d 1246 (10th Cir.); United States v. Rumpf, 576 F.2d 818 (10th Cir.); United States v. Buzzard, 540 F.2d 1383 (10th Cir.). [2] Thus (t)he Double Jeopardy Clause does protect a defendant against governmental actions intended to provoke mistrial requests and thereby to subject defendants to the substantial burdens imposed by multiple prosecutions. United States v. Scott, 437 U.S. 82, 94, 98 S.Ct. 2187, 2195, 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 2 \f U.S. v. Rios, 637 F.2d 728 (1980) 57 L.Ed.2d 65, citing United States v. Dinitz, 424 U.S. at 611, 96 S.Ct. at 1081. [3] Under this standard, retrial is allowable here because the record demonstrates that the prosecutor did not intend to cause *730 a mistrial request to further the chances of conviction. The trial court so found. At the hearing on the motion to bar reprosecution, the prosecutor testified that he definitely did not want to retry the case for several reasons. The trial court found no action by the prosecution was intended to cause a mistrial, and the evidence supports this finding. Although such prosecutorial misconduct is not to be condoned, bad faith in the abstract does not help the defendant in any event. It must be bad faith, the impact of which provokes a mistrial request. United States v. Leonard, 593 F.2d 951, 954 (10th Cir.). We cannot conclude under the circumstances revealed in the record that provoking a mistrial request was a motive of the prosecutor. The record instead indicates that a very strong case had been made against the defendant, that government witnesses might not be again available, and that no purpose would have been served by forcing a mistrial in order to enhance the prosecution's opportunity for conviction at another trial. AFFIRMED. McKAY, Circuit Judge, dissenting: In Lee v. United States, 432 U.S. 23, 97 S.Ct. 2141, 52 L.Ed.2d 80 (1977), the Supreme Court characterized the rule laid down in United States v. Dinitz, 424 U.S. 600, 96 S.Ct. 1075, 47 L.Ed.2d 267 (1976), as follows: (T)here was no double jeopardy barrier to petitioner's retrial unless the judicial or prosecutorial error that prompted petitioner's motion was intended to provoke the motion or was otherwise motivated by bad faith or undertaken to harass or prejudice petitioner. 432 U.S. at 33-34, 97 S.Ct. at 2147 (quoting United States v. Dinitz, 424 U.S. at 611, 96 S.Ct. at 1081) (emphasis added). The Court's failure to find a double jeopardy violation in Lee was based on the majority's conclusion that the prosecution's conduct did not evidence bad faith. That element has been supplied here by our own decision in the previous appeal of this case, United States v. Rios, 611 F.2d 1335 (10th Cir. 1979). There we effectively held that the prosecutor's comments constituted gross prosecutorial misconduct: The effect of these assertions before the jury was that defense counsel's investigator was clearly charged with contriving the defense testimony, with no factual basis to justify such a serious charge. Similar comments have been condemned by this court recently in United States v. Siviglia, No. 76-1914 (10th Cir. 6/5/78) (unpublished). There counsel argued that a witness had lied because defense counsel had told him to do so. We emphatically stated (slip op. 33-34): We hold and conclude that the prosecutor's comments constituted gross prosecutorial misconduct requiring reversal of Siviglia's conviction .... Second, there were remarks clearly directed at the appellant in the closing rebuttal, drawing an inference that appellant had threatened the safety of the Vega brothers who were testifying against him. There was no evidence linking the appellant to any such threats to the Vegas and the innuendo was unfounded and unfair.... Third, there was a strong statement of the prosecuting attorney's conclusion that the appellant was a large dealer in heroin.... We must agree that the effect of this rebuttal argument was to impress the jury with the prosecuting attorney's personal conclusion that the appellant was guilty. Such remarks expressing the personal opinion of the prosecuting attorney have been emphatically disapproved.... ...In such a case, with so much riding on the credibility of the appellant, and in view of the errors discussed, we must hold that the prosecutorial misconduct was prejudicial error which denied appellant a fair trial. *731 United States v.

Defendant-appellant, Rosalba Solivan ( defendant ) appeals from her March 28, 1990, judgment and sentence resulting from the sale of cocaine. For the following reasons, we REVERSE. I. A. Terry and Lorraine Brown (collectively the Browns ) became Drug Enforcement Administration ( DEA ) informants in July 1988, subsequent to Terry Brown's arrest for the purchase of one kilogram of cocaine from Pepe (defendant's former boyfriend) and defendant on March 8, 1988. On February 13, 1989, while in custody, the Browns began making a series of DEA controlled, tape recorded, telephone calls to defendant. The first call concerned the delivery of three to five kilograms of cocaine to northern Kentucky and the price of the cocaine. During a subsequent telephone conversation, defendant informed the Browns that the price would be $19,500 per kilogram of cocaine. The series of recorded telephone conversations, which took place over the following weeks, detailed defendant's involvement in the narcotics *1148 industry, the problems she encountered locating cocaine, and how she planned to fill the Browns' order for four kilograms of cocaine. On March 19, 1989, defendant flew to Cincinnati from Miami to complete the transaction. The Browns met her at the airport and transported her to the Holiday Inn in Covington, Kentucky, where they rented a room. Shortly thereafter, Francisco Gomez ( Gomez ) arrived at the hotel. Gomez had driven the cocaine from the New York City area to Covington. Terry Brown, Gomez and defendant went outside to Gomez' vehicle, retrieved the four kilograms of cocaine, brought it back to the hotel room, and examined it. DEA agents then entered the hotel room and arrested Gomez and defendant. B. On April 12, 1989, defendant and Gomez were indicted on seven counts, including conspiracy to distribute cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. 846; attempt to distribute cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. 846; interstate travel to facilitate narcotics activity, in violation of 18 U.S.C. 1952; and use of a telephone to facilitate narcotics activity, in violation of 21 U.S.C. 843(b). Gomez pled guilty to all charges on September 11, 1989. Defendant pled not guilty. Her trial commenced September 12, 1989, and concluded September 19, 1989. At trial, during closing argument, the Assistant United States Attorney ( Assistant U.S. Attorney or the prosecutor ) made the following remarks: [Assistant U.S. Attorney]: What you're listening to is a wholesale distributor of narcotics, cocaine discuss her business affairs and complain about her busy schedule, the lack of good product and the trouble she's having getting this stuff up here now.

The court did not immediately admonish the jury, but instead declared a recess. Out of the presence of the jury, the court allowed defense counsel to state his objection to the prosecutor's comment on closing. Defense counsel at that time also moved for a mistrial based on the prosecutor's highly prejudicial comments. The court sustained the objection but denied the motion for a mistrial. 1 The court stated *1149 that it would admonish the jury when court resumed, which it did, stating: At the conclusion ... certain remarks were made in the closing argument of the prosecutor to which the Court has sustained an objection and will admonish you not to consider them. Do not consider any urgings by the prosecutor to send messages to anybody. We're not here to send messages to anybody. We're here to try this defendant's case. It's our duty to try try this defendant's case based on the evidence in this case and the law in this case and not with concern about anybody else. The Court reiterates its instructions that if the evidence establishes beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty of the offense as charged or any of them its your duty to convict. If the United States fails to meet that burden, it's your duty to acquit. Don't worry about anybody else or send anybody any messages. We're concerned with this one case to try [defendant] on the evidence in it. Transcript at 768. The jury returned a verdict of guilty on all counts. On March 28, 1990, defendant was sentenced to 151 months imprisonment. Defendant filed a timely notice of appeal on March 28, 1990. II. A. On appeal, defendant argues that, during closing argument, the prosecutor made improper and prejudicial statements which deprived her of a fair trial. Defendant contends that the prosecutor's argument constitutes reversible error because the resulting prejudice was not cured by the district court's subsequent admonition to the jury. The prosecutor's remarks, defendant argues, were prejudicial because they improperly appealed to the community conscience and interest of the jurors in ridding society of drug dealers. The prosecutor counters that its comments, if improper, were cured by the district court's admonition. B. We review the district court's denial of defendant's motion for a mistrial for abuse of discretion. See *1150 Illinois v.

In the case before us, the question of whether the district court abused its discretion in turn depends on whether the conduct of the prosecutor constitutes reversible error. Cf. United States v. Alloway, 397 F.2d 105, 113 (6th Cir.1968) (no abuse of discretion shown in denying motion for a mistrial where prosecutor's argument was not found to warrant reversal). In making this determination, we consider whether there was misconduct. If there was misconduct, we must determine whether the misconduct was harmless. See United States v. Bess, 593 F.2d 749, 756 57 (6th Cir.1979) (determining first that the conduct complained of, the prosecutor's statement of personal belief of the defendant's guilt, constituted error and then determining that such conduct constituted reversible error). [1] Thus, this Court must determine whether defendant's right to a fair trial was prejudiced by improper prosecutorial conduct. There are instances where a single misstep on the 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 4 \f U.S. v. Solivan, 937 F.2d 1146 (1991) part of the prosecutor may be so destructive of the right to a fair trial that reversal is mandated. See Pierce v. United States, 86 F.2d 949 (6th Cir.1936). We realize that such instances may be rare, but we believe this case exemplifies a single misstep so destructive to defendant's right to a fair trial that it constitutes reversible error. C. 1. This Circuit has many times expressed itself fully on the issue of misconduct of government counsel in the prosecution of criminal cases. Our decisions in this area have recognized the standard of conduct imposed upon the prosecution of federal crimes as enunciated in Berger v. United States, 295 U.S. 78, 55 S.Ct. 629, 79 L.Ed. 1314 (1935). See, e.g., Bess, 593 F.2d at 756 57. In Berger, the Supreme Court considered an instance of prosecutorial misconduct involving both improper cross examination of witnesses and improper argument to the jury in a prosecution for conspiracy to utter counterfeit notes. Berger, 295 U.S. at 79 80, 55 S.Ct. at 629 30. The Supreme Court found that the prosecutor's conduct rose to the level of prejudicial misconduct because his argument to the jury was undignified and intemperate. The argument was found to have contained improper insinuations and assertions calculated to mislead the jury. Id. at 85, 55 S.Ct. at 632. Because the jury will normally place great confidence in the faithful execution of the obligations of a prosecuting attorney, improper insinuations or suggestions are apt to carry more weight against a defendant than such statements by witnesses. The Supreme Court stated the following in asserting that the conduct of government prosecutors must meet a high standard: The United States Attorney is the representative not of an ordinary party to a controversy, but of a sovereignty whose obligation to govern impartially is as compelling as its obligation to govern at all; and whose interest, therefore, in a criminal prosecution is not that it shall win a case, but that justice shall be done. As such, he is in a peculiar and very definite sense the servant of the law, the twofold aim of which is that guilt shall not escape or innocence suffer. He may prosecute with vigor indeed, he should do so. But, while he may strike hard blows, he is not at liberty to strike foul ones. It is as much his duty to refrain from improper methods calculated to produce a wrongful conviction as it is to use every legitimate means to bring about a just one. Id. at 88 89, 55 S.Ct. at 633. Thus, it is the duty of the prosecutor to advance the government's cause with force and persuasiveness. However, this duty encompasses concerns beyond mere advocacy. The prosecutor has a concomitant duty not to derogate from a fair and impartial criminal proceeding. Stated in slightly different terms, the government's conduct *1151 in prosecuting the defendant may determine whether or not a defendant is accorded his or her constitutional right to a fair trial. Cf. Viereck v. United States, 318 U.S. 236, 247 48, 63 S.Ct. 561, 566, 87 L.Ed. 734 (1943) (finding that the prosecutor's conduct prejudiced the defendant's right to a fair trial and was offensive to the dignity and good order with which all proceedings in court should be conducted and quoting language in Berger, 295 U.S. at 88, 55 S.Ct. at 633, which stressed that the role of the prosecutor in a criminal case is to see that justice is done); Bess, 593 F.2d at 755 (stating that prosecutors carry a special aura of legitimacy). In sum, the principles set forth in Berger forbid the government's injection of improper or prejudicial material that deprives an accused of his or her right to a fair trial. For instance, the government prosecutor may not express to the jury his or her personal knowledge of the guilt of the accused, Bess, 593 F.2d at 754, or bring to the jury's attention purported facts that are not in evidence and are prejudicial, United States v. Leon, 534 F.2d 667, 679 (6th Cir.1976) (citing Berger, 295 U.S. at 88, 55 S.Ct. at 633). 2. [2] Unless calculated to incite the passions and prejudices of the jurors, appeals to the jury to act as the community 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 5 \f U.S. v. Solivan, 937 F.2d 1146 (1991) conscience are not per se impermissible. See Henderson v. United States, 218 F.2d 14, 19 20 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 349 U.S. 920, 75 S.Ct. 660, 99 L.Ed. 1253 (1955). 2 Our determination of whether comments are calculated to incite prejudice and passion in the jury is informed by the Supreme Court opinion in Viereck. Eight years after the Berger decision, in Viereck, the Supreme Court considered the propriety of a prosecutor's closing argument which appealed to the national or patriotic community interest of the jurors during World War II. The petitioner had been convicted for willfully omitting a material fact in a registration form filed by him with the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State required the registration of certain agents of foreign principals. The Secretary of State also required disclosure of the terms and conditions of the agents' contracts with foreign principals. Viereck, 318 U.S. at 237 38, 63 S.Ct. at 561 62. At a time when the United States was participating in World War II, the Supreme Court found that statements by the prosecutor regarding jurors' patriotism constituted an appeal wholly irrelevant to any facts or issues in the case, the purpose and effect of which could have only been to arouse passion and prejudice. While the Supreme Court reversed on the grounds of a different error, the Court explicitly stated that it thought the prosecutor's conduct prejudiced the petitioner's right to a fair trial and that, independent of the error for which the conviction was reversed, the conduct might well have placed the judgment *1152 of conviction in jeopardy. The remarks found prejudicial were as follows: In closing, let me remind you, ladies and gentlemen, that this is war. This is war, harsh, cruel, murderous war. There are those who, right at this very moment, are plotting your death and my death; plotting our death and the death of our families because we have committed no other crime than that we do not agree with their ideas of persecution and concentration camps. This is war. It is a fight to the death. The American people are relying upon you ladies and gentlemen for their protection against this sort of crime, just as much as they are relying upon the protection of the men who man the guns in Bataan Peninsula, and everywhere else. They are relying upon you ladies and gentlemen for their protection. We are at war. You have a duty to perform here. As a representative of your Government I am calling upon every one of you to do your duty. Id. at 247 n. 3, 63 S.Ct. at 566 n. 3. [3] The remarks in the instant case are analogous to the comments adjudged inflammatory and prejudicial in Viereck. The fairness or unfairness of comments appealing to the national or local community interests of jurors in a given instance will depend in great part on the nature of the community interest appealed to, and its relationship to, and the nature of, the wider social-political context to which it refers. The correlation between the community interest comments and the wider social-political context to a large extent controls the determination of whether an appeal is deemed impermissible because it is calculated to inflame passion and prejudice. The Supreme Court in Viereck framed the inquiry to incorporate both the purpose and effect of the comments. In that case, in the light of contemporaneous events, which had great impact on the emotions and perceptions of jurors, the remarks could only have ... arouse[d] passion and prejudice. See id. at 247, 63 S.Ct. at 566. In United States v. Barker, 553 F.2d 1013, 1024 25 (6th Cir.1977), in reviewing a conviction for bank robbery, we considered remarks which were found to have been deliberately made. These remarks were: [I]f you can't take this evidence and find these defendants guilty on this evidence that [sic] we might as well open all the banks and say, Come on and get the money, boys, because we'll never be able to convict them. Id. at 1025. We determined that it was beyond the bounds of propriety for a prosecutor to suggest that unless the defendant was convicted it would be impossible to maintain law and order in the jurors' community. Id. 3 The D.C. Circuit has applied this principle prohibiting appeals which are inflammatory in the contemporary climate to pleas against the drug problem in the ongoing drug war. United States v. Hawkins, 595 F.2d 751 (D.C.Cir.1978), cert. denied, 441 U.S. 910, 99 S.Ct. 2005, 60 L.Ed.2d 380 (1979). The D.C. Circuit stated that prosecutors are not at liberty to substitute emotion for evidence by equating, directly or by innuendo, a verdict of guilty to a blow against the drug problem. Id. at 754. 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 6 \f U.S. v. Solivan, 937 F.2d 1146 (1991) In United States v. Barlin, 686 F.2d 81 (2d Cir.1982), the Second Circuit found improper statements very similar to the ones alleged prejudicial in the instant case. In Barlin, the court found the prosecutor to *1153 have improperly appealed to the jury's passion and emotion in characterizing its job as the one occasion on which you have a duty to do something about the drug traffic in our community. Id. at 93. We agree with the Second Circuit's condemnation of this genre of comments designed to divert rather than focus the jury upon the evidence. See id. [4] We agree with the following statement by the court in United States v. Monaghan, 741 F.2d 1434 (D.C.Cir.1984), cert. denied, 470 U.S. 1085, 105 S.Ct. 1847, 85 L.Ed.2d 146 (1985), condemning appeals to the community interest to end a societal evil: lurking A prosecutor may not urge jurors to convict a criminal defendant in order to protect community values, preserve civil order, or deter future lawbreaking. The evil in such prosecutorial appeals is that the defendant will be convicted for reasons wholly irrelevant to his own guilt or innocence. Jurors may be persuaded by such appeals to believe that, by convicting a defendant, they will assist in the solution of some pressing social problem. The amelioration of society's woes is far too heavy a burden for the individual criminal defendant to bear. Id. at 1441. [5] In the instant case, we examine closely the substance of the prosecutor's statements to determine whether they were calculated to inflame. Our determination will depend on whether the statements appeal to community interests in light of current events and the nature of the specific case. In the case before us, the effect of the prosecutor's comments was to suggest to the jury that, because of defendant's participation in the drug trade in northern Kentucky, the drug problem facing the jurors' community would continue if they did not convict her. It is error for a prosecutor to direct the jurors' desires to end a social problem toward convicting a particular defendant. Even though this nation is in the midst of an ongoing crisis, popularly termed the War on Drugs, this crisis does not create an excuse to impinge on the constitutional right to a fair trial. We repeat what we stated in United States v. Radka, 904 F.2d 357 (6th Cir.1990): Presently, our nation is plagued with the destructive effects of the illegal importation and distribution of drugs. At this critical time, our Constitution remains a lodestar for the protections that shall endure the most pernicious affronts to our society.... The drug crisis does not license the aggrandizement of governmental power liberties. Despite the devastation wrought by drug trafficking in communities nationwide, we cannot suspend the precious rights guaranteed by the Constitution in an effort to fight the War on Drugs. lieu of civil in Id. at 361 (reversing a denial of a defendant's motion to suppress evidence obtained in a warrantless search of defendant's home because there were no exigent circumstances). Here, defendant's constitutional right to a fair trial was violated because the appeal to the community conscience in the context of the War on Drugs prejudicially impacted on her. The fear surrounding the War on Drugs undoubtedly influenced the jury by diverting its attention away from its task to weigh the evidence and submit a reasoned decision finding defendant guilty or innocent of the crimes with which she was charged. The substance of the statements made by the prosecutor in this case were designed, both in purpose and effect, to arouse passion and prejudice and to inflame the jurors' emotions regarding the War on Drugs by urging them to send a message and strike a blow to the drug problem. This nation faces a variety of social problems with which all citizens are daily confronted. The drug problem is one of the most compelling and devastating problems faced by this nation today. This Court is acutely aware of the 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 7 \f U.S. v. Solivan, 937 F.2d 1146 (1991) nature and extent of the drug problem. However, government prosecutors are not at liberty to urge jurors to convict defendants as blows to the drug problem faced by society or specifically, within their communities, or to send messages to all drug dealers. Such appeals are extremely prejudicial and harmful *1154 to the constitutional right to a fair trial. It should be clear from the foregoing discussion that, while not causing error per se unless the statements are deemed to be calculated to incite prejudice, prosecutors should exercise extreme caution when making any statement referring to the community interests of jurors. The government relies on United States v. Alloway, 397 F.2d 105 (6th Cir.1968), to provide an example of a similar instance of comments directed to the community conscience of jurors. In Alloway we reviewed a conviction for armed robbery of a Federal Savings & Loan Association. The defendant asserted that improper argument by the prosecutor should have resulted in a mistrial. We held that the following statements by the prosecutor did not exceed the permissible bounds of advocacy and that therefore the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's motion for a mistrial: You, the jurors, are called upon in this case to be the world conscience of the community. And I'm calling on this jury to speak out for the community and let the John Alloways know that this type of conduct will not be tolerated, that we're not going to tolerate [armed robbery].... 397 F.2d at 113. The district court in Alloway subsequently instructed the jury to base its verdict solely on the evidence and to consider the prosecutor's argument only as it corresponded with the evidence. Id. The comments by the prosecutor in Alloway and the comments complained of in the instant case are only vaguely similar. The remarks in this case appear to us to have been deliberately injected into the proceedings to incite the jury against defendant. Given the nature of this case, involving a cocaine transaction, and the wider social context which the prosecutor sought to bring to bear on the proceedings, the national drug problem, the purpose and effect of the comments could have only been to arouse passion and prejudice. See Viereck, 318 U.S. at 247, 63 S.Ct. at 566. We determined that the statements made in Alloway were not deliberately injected into the proceedings to inflame the jury. See 397 F.2d at 113. Indeed, examined in the light of the nature of the case and the wider social context in which the case was prosecuted, it is clear that the government's statements in Alloway were devoid of the sort of inflammatory content inherent in the prosecutor's statements in this case precisely because there was no comparable specific wider context of national attention and concern present in Alloway pertaining to armed robbery. The comments in Alloway did not attempt to compare or to associate the defendant with a feared and highly publicized group, such as drug dealers, as did the prosecutor in this case. The prosecutor in Alloway did not go beyond a mere allusion to the general need to convict guilty people, as did the prosecutor in this case, and bring to bear upon the jury's deliberations the attendant social consequences of defendant's criminal conduct or urge the jury to convict an individual defendant in an effort to ameliorate society's woes. Here, the prosecutor honed in on the illegal drug trade, which is the specific focus of much national attention, concern and fear. Thus, in Alloway, we were not presented with a context similar to the context of the case before us now. This case involves a woman charged with possession of cocaine with intent to distribute cocaine, among other charges. The wider social, political reality into which the prosecutor impermissibly sought to insert the case is the highly publicized, national and international drug trade. The prosecutor brought to bear upon the jury's decision whether to convict defendant the pervasive fear of drugs and the attendant dangers of drugs and drug addiction. The almost daily attention given by the media and politicians to the drug trade and gang violence, for example, have heightened the nation's awareness of, and hardened its attitudes towards, the drug problem. Thus, the prosecutor's appeal to the jury to convict a defendant as a blow to the drug problem or to send messages to drug dealers cannot be other than highly prejudicial given the specific context of the case in the current social-political environment. *1155 In Alloway, we were presented with remarks by the prosecutor which alluded only to the general criminality of the defendant's conduct in robbing a bank and the general community need to convict guilty people. The comments at issue in Alloway constituted a general plea which did 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 8 \f U.S. v. Solivan, 937 F.2d 1146 (1991) not even specifically refer to the crime of armed robbery. Moreover, armed robbery was not and is not the specific focus of national attention as is the drug problem. In the instant case, we find that Alloway is inapposite because, in this case, the prosecutor went beyond the scope of the prosecutor's statements in Alloway, which constituted a mere innocuous reference to the community or societal need to convict guilty people. The prosecutor in the instant case went beyond stating the obvious, and went so far as to urge the jury to send a message to the community, to defendant and all of the drug dealers like her by convicting defendant. The prosecutor suggested to the jury that convicting defendant would help keep its community in northern Kentucky free of the drug trade by sending the message that we don't want that stuff in Northern Kentucky and that anybody who brings that stuff ... presumably would be convicted just like defendant in this case. We determine that the prosecutor improperly injected the spectre of an influx of cocaine dealers into the jurors' community in an attempt to appeal to the jurors' emotions, passions and prejudices against the drug problem. See generally United States v. Love, 534 F.2d 87, 89 (6th Cir.1976) (finding reversible misconduct where prosecutor intentionally and for no legitimate purpose injected into the trial the spectre of organized crime and the Mafia). Thus, we conclude that the complained of remarks by the prosecutor in this case constitute error. The remarks were isolated to one portion of the trial, closing argument. However, this fact does not ameliorate their prejudicial impact; the remarks were misleading, inflammatory and prejudiced defendant's right to a fair trial. D. 1. [6] Having determined that the prosecutor's remarks were prejudicial to defendant's right to a fair trial and thus constituted error, we now turn to examine whether such error was harmless. [7] Our review of a claim of prosecutorial misconduct on appeal is guided by the standards set forth in Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967), to determine whether constitutional error is harmless error or whether reversible error has resulted from improper evidence or improper argument to the jury. In Chapman, the Supreme Court held that errors at trial, even federal constitutional errors, do not require automatic reversal of a conviction if the error can be classified as harmless. It is incumbent upon the government to demonstrate that such constitutional error, resulting from the admission of highly prejudicial evidence or comment, is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Id. at 24, 87 S.Ct. at 828. If there is a reasonable possibility that the evidence or comment complained of might have contributed to the conviction, then such error cannot be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. See id. at 23 24, 87 S.Ct. at 827 28 (relying on Fahy v. Connecticut, 375 U.S. 85, 84 S.Ct. 229, 11 L.Ed.2d 171 (1963)); Coury v. Livesay, 868 F.2d 842, 845 46 (6th Cir.1989) (applying the Chapman harmless error analysis to determine whether the error affected the result). [8] The result of a harmless error analysis depends on the circumstances of the particular case. Phelps v. Duckworth, 772 F.2d 1410, 1413 (7th Cir.) (en banc), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 1011, 106 S.Ct. 541, 88 L.Ed.2d 471 (1985); United States v. Shue, 766 F.2d 1122, 1132 (7th Cir.1985). Determining whether an error is reversible necessitates examination of the entire record. See United States v. Hasting, 461 U.S. 499, 509, 103 S.Ct. 1974, 1980, 76 L.Ed.2d 96 (1983). Hasting reiterated the Supreme Court's recognition that given the myriad safeguards provided to assure a fair trial, and taking into account the reality of the human fallibility of the participants, there can be no such thing as an *1156 error free, perfect trial, and that the Constitution does not guarantee such a trial. Id. at 508 09, 103 S.Ct. at 1980. 2. [9] The government urges us to find that the prosecutor's comments were fair comment based upon the evidence and were cured by an admonition from the trial judge. Prosecutorial missteps have been held harmless in light of the relative strength of the evidence or because instructions given by the trial court sufficiently diluted or eradicated any resulting prejudice. See United States v. Hawkins, 595 F.2d 751, 754 55 (D.C.Cir.1978), cert. denied, 441 U.S. 910, 99 S.Ct. 2005, 60 L.Ed.2d 380 (1979). Regardless of the strength of the case against defendant, the instructions given by the 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 9 \f U.S. v. Solivan, 937 F.2d 1146 (1991) district court were insufficient and came too late to mitigate the negative and highly prejudicial impact of the remarks on the jurors' minds, especially since the remarks were among the final arguments presented to the jurors prior to their deliberations. [10] When isolated remarks are made in the course of a long trial and the jury is given an appropriate cautionary instruction designed to overcome any prejudice that may have been caused, the error may be harmless. We examine the curative effect, if any, of the cautionary instruction to the jury in the light of the degree and effect of the prejudice. However, an error may be so prejudicial that no cautionary instruction, however swiftly and forcibly given, can safely eradicate its effect. See Pierce v. United States, 86 F.2d 949, 952 53 (6th Cir.1936). In Pierce, we articulated the method for testing prejudice where a cautionary instruction has been given to a jury because of improper argument by a prosecutor: The inquiry ... must always be as to whether in view of the whole record the impression conveyed to the minds of jurors by irrelevant and prejudicial matter is such that the court may fairly say that it has not been successfully eradicated by the rulings of the trial judge, his admonition to counsel, and his instruction to the jurors to disregard it. Id. at 952. Similarly, in Ippolito v. United States, 108 F.2d 668, 670 71 (6th Cir.1940), we stated that appeals to the passion and prejudice of a jury, while constituting error, do not require reversal unless such error affects the substantial rights of parties. Id. at 670. We recognized, as we do here, that a single instance of error may be so destructive of a defendant's right to a fair trial that reversal must follow. Id. at 671. In United States v. Ashworth, 836 F.2d 260, 267 (6th Cir.1988), we adopted the Ninth Circuit's analysis in United States v. Flake, 746 F.2d 535 (9th Cir.1984), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1225, 105 S.Ct. 1220, 84 L.Ed.2d 360 (1985). The Flake court framed the question of whether a new trial is warranted as whether improprieties in counsel's argument to the jury were so gross as to probably prejudice the defendant and whether any resulting prejudice was not neutralized by the trial judge's instruction or admonition to the jury. Id. at 542. The court in Flake found that improprieties in the prosecutor's argument to the jury were improper but not gross, and in any case were followed swiftly by the court's admonition and the prosecutor's apology and personal request that the jury heed the court's instructions. Ashworth involved an appeal from the defendants' convictions for conspiracy and arson. The Ashworth court applied the Flake approach to determine whether prejudice resulted from improper prosecutorial comment on a fact not in evidence and whether such comment was cured by an admonition from the court. In argument to the jury, the prosecutor referred to prior statements by two co-defendants to the effect that they denied talking to each other on the night of the fire. On appeal, we concluded that the prosecutor's comment was not so gross as to probably prejudice the defendants and that any slight prejudice resulting from the improper argument was neutralized by the court's cautionary instruction to the jury that the attorneys' arguments were not evidence. Ashworth, 836 F.2d at 267. *1157 In this case, we find the comments made by the prosecutor during closing argument to have been so gross as to probably prejudice defendant. We also find that the trial court's admonition to the jury did not neutralize the prejudice resulting from such comments. Therefore, we cannot conclude that there is no reasonable possibility that the comments did not contribute to defendant's conviction. [11] Both the timing and the firmness of the trial court's admonition are relevant in evaluating whether an admonition has been sufficient to mitigate prejudicial error. In Bess we found the timing of the trial judge's admonition relevant. In finding improper remarks by the prosecutor to constitute reversible error, we noted that the objectionable remarks were promptly objected to, but that the trial judge failed to give an immediate curative admonition. 593 F.2d at 757. In Bess we stressed that corrective measures should be taken immediately in instances of prosecutorial misconduct so as to ameliorate any resulting prejudice. Id. at 757 n. 10. While the trial judge in this case did admonish the jury, the admonition given to the jury took place after a twenty-minute recess which occurred immediately following the prosecutor's improper statements. As the defense counsel stated, these comments were allowed to become etched in granite in the 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 10 \f U.S. v. Solivan, 937 F.2d 1146 (1991) jurors' minds. The admonition given by the district court in this case was given too late to eradicate the prejudice from the jurors' minds. Moreover, the misconduct which took place in the instant case called for stern rebuke and repressive measures. Berger v. United States, 295 U.S. 78, 85, 55 S.Ct. 629, 632, 79 L.Ed. 1314 (1935). In cases where an admonition has been found to mitigate or remove the taint of prejudicial prosecutorial misconduct, the admonition has been swiftly given and firm. See Phelps v. Duckworth, 772 F.2d 1410, 1413 14 (7th Cir.) (en banc), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 1011, 106 S.Ct. 541, 88 L.Ed.2d 471 (1985). In Phelps, the jury was admonished twice to correct the prejudicial statements. Id. Moreover, in Phelps, the jury was admonished immediately. The admonition in this case was neither swiftly given nor did it sufficiently convey to the jury a sense of judicial disapproval of the remarks to dispel the harmful content and impact of the prosecutor's egregious statements. Even were the district court to have immediately and appropriately admonished the jury to disregard the remarks, we doubt seriously that any cautionary instruction could have safely eradicated the highly prejudicial effect of the prosecutor's statements in this case. The statements were deliberately injected into the proceedings to inflame the jurors' emotions and fears associated with the current drug epidemic that is reported daily in our newspapers and which threatens the very fabric of our society. Cf. United States v. Love, 534 F.2d 87, 89 (6th Cir.1976) (finding the trial judge's effort to neutralize prejudicial government comments ineffective and reversing the defendant's conviction where prosecutor intentionally injected into the trial the spectre of organized crime and the Mafia). The statements were so inflammatory in the context of the ongoing drug war that no charge could have sufficiently cured the prejudice. In the instant case, we cannot say that the government has demonstrated, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the prejudicial comments did not contribute to the defendant's conviction. As we have stated previously, [d]ue process does not require perfect trials but it mandates fair ones. Love, 534 F.2d at 89. III. that find the egregious prosecutorial Because we misconduct which occurred in this case did not constitute harmless error, we conclude that the district court abused its discretion in denying defendant's motion for a mistrial. Accordingly, the judgment and sentence against defendant are REVERSED and this case is REMANDED for a new trial consistent with this opinion. Footnotes 1 The trial transcript reveals that the following dialogue took place out of the presence of the jury immediately after the Assistant U.S. Attorney concluded his closing argument: The Court: All right. You have a state your motion and your objection. [Defense Counsel]: Your Honor, comes now the defendant Rosalba Solivan and based on counsel's comment in closing argument with respect to her other activities and the drug business of which there's no significant The Court: Can't hear you. [Defense Counsel]: of which there's no significance or substantial evidence, as well as his last comment, and that to send a message to the other drug dealers in Northern Kentucky that's clearly an appeal to the community interest of this jury. It is extremely predudicial to make that type of comment that you have to lock her up and send a message. It's kind of like giving a punitive damage argument in a straight negligence case, this send-a-message type argument. It's extremely prejudicial given the nature of the publicity about Columbia, the nature of the political situation, the the repeated references in the newspapers, in the media to the drug problem, the President's speech on drugs. A gallup poll has shown that [for] the majority of Americans, this [sic] [is] their number one concern right now, all these things in this climate in this time, that type of comment is overkill. It's prejudicial, and we respectfully move for a mistrial. The Court: All right. Sustain the motion for a mistrial. I think it's probably going a little too far. I think it's overwhelming the motion has two parts. I think there's a lot of evidence of that in there which counsel can put on the characterization she was in the drug business, as he has spelled out. But I don't think you can should be asking the jury to send anybody messages. It's the duty of the jury to convict if there's proof beyond a reasonable doubt and to acquit if there isn't proof beyond a reasonable doubt, and the jury will be so admonished. 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 11 \f U.S. v. Solivan, 937 F.2d 1146 (1991) However, in the light of all the evidence I think it can be cured by an admonition. I don't think a little rhetoric if cured by an admonition of the Court is going to taint the whole trial, during which counsel has been afforded counsel for the defense has been afforded great liberality. As you know, we were inclined not to give the entrapment instruction at all. You got that. [Defense Counsel]: I would have The Court: I think you've had a very fair trial and we will cure this with an admonition. He didn't get very far with it before you interrupted him. * * * * * * The Court: It's the part about sending the message that I find objectionable. [Defense Counsel]: The part about sending the message is amplified The Court: It's not their duty to send messages. It's their duty to acquit or convict if there's evidence beyond a reasonable doubt and acquit if there isn't evidence beyond a reasonable doubt. I'm going to tell them that when they get back. [Defense Counsel]: Well, without waiving our motion, we would ask for the instruction. I don't think it's going to cure it. The Court: I think it will cure it. [Defense Counsel]: It's going to be etched in granite on these jurors' minds. The Court: Going to be what? [Defense Counsel]: Etched in granite. It's going to be like trying to unring a bell. It's been told to them. He's gotten his message across. He's gone to the community interests, the other drug problems and other drug dealers. I think it's just a grievous error, Judge. The only way it can be rectified is to declare a mistrial. The Court: Well, you made your motion. I'll overrule the motion. I'll correct it. I think it can be corrected with an admonition. And to my observation of the jury you had a very fair trial, I think. We've been more liberal with you than with most people as far as the time we've allowed you to take and everything. I think it can be cured with an admonition. I'll do it when we get back. About ten more minutes. Transcript at 768 71. Our holding in Henderson and the result reached in Alloway reflect a general rule followed by other circuits as well. In United States v. Shirley, 435 F.2d 1076 (7th Cir.1970), the Seventh Circuit stated that the prosecutor's closing remarks concerning the increasing number of cars being stolen did not overstep the bounds of fairness and propriety and could not have worked a substantial injury to the defendant in denying him a fair trial because, even though the statements were not particularly relevant and had no bearing on the guilt or innocence of the defendant, the remarks did not contain an emotional appeal to the jurors' self-interest designed to arouse their prejudice against the defendant. Id. at 1079. The Eighth Circuit has also stated, in a case where the prosecutor told the jurors that they were the public's last shield and the district court instructed the jury to disregard the remark, that unless calculated to inflame, an appeal to the jury to act as the conscience of the community is not impermissible. United States v. Lewis, 547 F.2d 1030, 1036 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 1111, 97 S.Ct. 1149, 51 L.Ed.2d 566 (1976). Similarly, the Eleventh Circuit, in United States v. Kopituk, 690 F.2d 1289, 1342 43 (11th Cir.1982), cert. denied, 463 U.S. 1209, 103 S.Ct. 3542, 77 L.Ed.2d 1391 (1983), stated that appeals to the jury to act as the conscience of the community, unless designed to inflame the jury, are not per se impermissible. However, the remarks complained of in Kopituk were found by the court to have approached the line demarcating impermissible comment calculated to incite the jury against the accused, but not to have crossed the line into the realm of impropriety and prejudice by directly suggesting that the jurors had personal stakes in the outcome of the case. Similar reasoning was applied in Brown v. United States, 370 F.2d 242 (D.C.Cir.1966), a case involving a criminal prosecution of an African American youth for assault based on a confrontation between the defendant and two police officers. The court found the prosecutor's community appeal improper. During closing argument, the prosecutor warned the jury that to acquit the defendant would leave the police powerless to protect themselves and citizens against assault short of resort to martial law. In condemning these remarks, and in reversing the defendant's conviction, the D.C. Circuit found that such an argument was an appeal wholly irrelevant to any facts or issues in the case. Id. at 246 (relying on Viereck, 318 U.S. at 247, 63 S.Ct. at 566, and Berger, 295 U.S. at 88, 55 S.Ct. at 633). Further, the court stated that the prosecutor's argument raised the spectre of martial law and therefore constituted an especially flagrant and reprehensible appeal to passion and prejudice in the context of current events (i.e., the social unrest of the late 1960s). 2015 Thomson Reuters.

During a subsequent telephone conversation, defendant informed the Browns that the price would be $19,500 per kilogram of cocaine. The series of recorded telephone conversations, which took place over the following weeks, detailed defendant's involvement in the narcotics *1148 industry, the problems she encountered locating cocaine, and how she planned to fill the Browns' order for four kilograms of cocaine. On March 19, 1989, defendant flew to Cincinnati from Miami to complete the transaction. The Browns met her at the airport and transported her to the Holiday Inn in Covington, Kentucky, where they rented a room. Shortly thereafter, Francisco Gomez ( Gomez ) arrived at the hotel. Gomez had driven the cocaine from the New York City area to Covington. Terry Brown, Gomez and defendant went outside to Gomez' vehicle, retrieved the four kilograms of cocaine, brought it back to the hotel room, and examined it. DEA agents then entered the hotel room and arrested Gomez and defendant. B. On April 12, 1989, defendant and Gomez were indicted on seven counts, including conspiracy to distribute cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. 846; attempt to distribute cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. 846; interstate travel to facilitate narcotics activity, in violation of 18 U.S.C. 1952; and use of a telephone to facilitate narcotics activity, in violation of 21 U.S.C. 843(b). Gomez pled guilty to all charges on September 11, 1989. Defendant pled not guilty. Her trial commenced September 12, 1989, and concluded September 19, 1989. At trial, during closing argument, the Assistant United States Attorney ( Assistant U.S. Attorney or the prosecutor ) made the following remarks: [Assistant U.S. Attorney]: What you're listening to is a wholesale distributor of narcotics, cocaine discuss her business affairs and complain about her busy schedule, the lack of good product and the trouble she's having getting this stuff up here now. And I'd submit to you, folks, that she's been caught now. And I'm asking you to tell her and all of the other drug dealers like her (defense counsel's objection and Court's response omitted) [t]hat we don't want that stuff in Northern Kentucky and that anybody who brings that stuff in Northern Kentucky and ... 2015 Thomson Reuters.

[Assistant U.S. Attorney]: Oh, okay. I'm sorry. The Court: Ready to break off? [Assistant U.S. Attorney]: gentlemen.... Just that, ladies and Transcript at 767 68 (emphasis added). The court did not immediately admonish the jury, but instead declared a recess. Out of the presence of the jury, the court allowed defense counsel to state his objection to the prosecutor's comment on closing. Defense counsel at that time also moved for a mistrial based on the prosecutor's highly prejudicial comments. The court sustained the objection but denied the motion for a mistrial. 1 The court stated *1149 that it would admonish the jury when court resumed, which it did, stating: At the conclusion ... certain remarks were made in the closing argument of the prosecutor to which the Court has sustained an objection and will admonish you not to consider them. Do not consider any urgings by the prosecutor to send messages to anybody. We're not here to send messages to anybody. We're here to try this defendant's case. It's our duty to try try this defendant's case based on the evidence in this case and the law in this case and not with concern about anybody else. The Court reiterates its instructions that if the evidence establishes beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty of the offense as charged or any of them its your duty to convict. If the United States fails to meet that burden, it's your duty to acquit. Don't worry about anybody else or send anybody any messages. We're concerned with this one case to try [defendant] on the evidence in it. Transcript at 768. The jury returned a verdict of guilty on all counts. On March 28, 1990, defendant was sentenced to 151 months imprisonment. Defendant filed a timely notice of appeal on March 28, 1990. II. A. On appeal, defendant argues that, during closing argument, the prosecutor made improper and prejudicial statements which deprived her of a fair trial. Defendant contends that the prosecutor's argument constitutes reversible error because the resulting prejudice was not cured by the district court's subsequent admonition to the jury. The prosecutor's remarks, defendant argues, were prejudicial because they improperly appealed to the community conscience and interest of the jurors in ridding society of drug dealers. The prosecutor counters that its comments, if improper, were cured by the district court's admonition. B. We review the district court's denial of defendant's motion for a mistrial for abuse of discretion. See *1150 Illinois v. Somerville, 410 U.S. 458, 462 64, 93 S.Ct. 1066, 1069 70, 35 L.Ed.2d 425 (1973); United States v. Cordell, 924 F.2d 614, 617 (6th Cir.1991) (citing United States v. Levy, 904 F.2d 1026, 1030 (6th Cir.1990), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 1091, 111 S.Ct. 974, 112 L.Ed.2d 1060 (1991)). In the case before us, the question of whether the district court abused its discretion in turn depends on whether the conduct of the prosecutor constitutes reversible error. Cf. United States v. Alloway, 397 F.2d 105, 113 (6th Cir.1968) (no abuse of discretion shown in denying motion for a mistrial where prosecutor's argument was not found to warrant reversal). In making this determination, we consider whether there was misconduct. If there was misconduct, we must determine whether the misconduct was harmless. See United States v. Bess, 593 F.2d 749, 756 57 (6th Cir.1979) (determining first that the conduct complained of, the prosecutor's statement of personal belief of the defendant's guilt, constituted error and then determining that such conduct constituted reversible error). [1] Thus, this Court must determine whether defendant's right to a fair trial was prejudiced by improper prosecutorial conduct. There are instances where a single misstep on the 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 4 \f U.S. v. Solivan, 937 F.2d 1146 (1991) part of the prosecutor may be so destructive of the right to a fair trial that reversal is mandated. See Pierce v. United States, 86 F.2d 949 (6th Cir.1936). We realize that such instances may be rare, but we believe this case exemplifies a single misstep so destructive to defendant's right to a fair trial that it constitutes reversible error. C. 1. This Circuit has many times expressed itself fully on the issue of misconduct of government counsel in the prosecution of criminal cases. Our decisions in this area have recognized the standard of conduct imposed upon the prosecution of federal crimes as enunciated in Berger v. United States, 295 U.S. 78, 55 S.Ct. 629, 79 L.Ed. 1314 (1935). See, e.g., Bess, 593 F.2d at 756 57. In Berger, the Supreme Court considered an instance of prosecutorial misconduct involving both improper cross examination of witnesses and improper argument to the jury in a prosecution for conspiracy to utter counterfeit notes. Berger, 295 U.S. at 79 80, 55 S.Ct. at 629 30. The Supreme Court found that the prosecutor's conduct rose to the level of prejudicial misconduct because his argument to the jury was undignified and intemperate. The argument was found to have contained improper insinuations and assertions calculated to mislead the jury. Id. at 85, 55 S.Ct. at 632. Because the jury will normally place great confidence in the faithful execution of the obligations of a prosecuting attorney, improper insinuations or suggestions are apt to carry more weight against a defendant than such statements by witnesses. The Supreme Court stated the following in asserting that the conduct of government prosecutors must meet a high standard: The United States Attorney is the representative not of an ordinary party to a controversy, but of a sovereignty whose obligation to govern impartially is as compelling as its obligation to govern at all; and whose interest, therefore, in a criminal prosecution is not that it shall win a case, but that justice shall be done. As such, he is in a peculiar and very definite sense the servant of the law, the twofold aim of which is that guilt shall not escape or innocence suffer. He may prosecute with vigor indeed, he should do so. But, while he may strike hard blows, he is not at liberty to strike foul ones. It is as much his duty to refrain from improper methods calculated to produce a wrongful conviction as it is to use every legitimate means to bring about a just one. Id. at 88 89, 55 S.Ct. at 633. Thus, it is the duty of the prosecutor to advance the government's cause with force and persuasiveness. However, this duty encompasses concerns beyond mere advocacy. The prosecutor has a concomitant duty not to derogate from a fair and impartial criminal proceeding. Stated in slightly different terms, the government's conduct *1151 in prosecuting the defendant may determine whether or not a defendant is accorded his or her constitutional right to a fair trial. Cf. Viereck v. United States, 318 U.S. 236, 247 48, 63 S.Ct. 561, 566, 87 L.Ed. 734 (1943) (finding that the prosecutor's conduct prejudiced the defendant's right to a fair trial and was offensive to the dignity and good order with which all proceedings in court should be conducted and quoting language in Berger, 295 U.S. at 88, 55 S.Ct. at 633, which stressed that the role of the prosecutor in a criminal case is to see that justice is done); Bess, 593 F.2d at 755 (stating that prosecutors carry a special aura of legitimacy). In sum, the principles set forth in Berger forbid the government's injection of improper or prejudicial material that deprives an accused of his or her right to a fair trial. For instance, the government prosecutor may not express to the jury his or her personal knowledge of the guilt of the accused, Bess, 593 F.2d at 754, or bring to the jury's attention purported facts that are not in evidence and are prejudicial, United States v. Leon, 534 F.2d 667, 679 (6th Cir.1976) (citing Berger, 295 U.S. at 88, 55 S.Ct. at 633). 2. [2] Unless calculated to incite the passions and prejudices of the jurors, appeals to the jury to act as the community 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 5 \f U.S. v. Solivan, 937 F.2d 1146 (1991) conscience are not per se impermissible. See Henderson v. United States, 218 F.2d 14, 19 20 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 349 U.S. 920, 75 S.Ct. 660, 99 L.Ed. 1253 (1955). 2 Our determination of whether comments are calculated to incite prejudice and passion in the jury is informed by the Supreme Court opinion in Viereck. Eight years after the Berger decision, in Viereck, the Supreme Court considered the propriety of a prosecutor's closing argument which appealed to the national or patriotic community interest of the jurors during World War II. The petitioner had been convicted for willfully omitting a material fact in a registration form filed by him with the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State required the registration of certain agents of foreign principals. The Secretary of State also required disclosure of the terms and conditions of the agents' contracts with foreign principals. Viereck, 318 U.S. at 237 38, 63 S.Ct. at 561 62. At a time when the United States was participating in World War II, the Supreme Court found that statements by the prosecutor regarding jurors' patriotism constituted an appeal wholly irrelevant to any facts or issues in the case, the purpose and effect of which could have only been to arouse passion and prejudice. While the Supreme Court reversed on the grounds of a different error, the Court explicitly stated that it thought the prosecutor's conduct prejudiced the petitioner's right to a fair trial and that, independent of the error for which the conviction was reversed, the conduct might well have placed the judgment *1152 of conviction in jeopardy. The remarks found prejudicial were as follows: In closing, let me remind you, ladies and gentlemen, that this is war. This is war, harsh, cruel, murderous war. There are those who, right at this very moment, are plotting your death and my death; plotting our death and the death of our families because we have committed no other crime than that we do not agree with their ideas of persecution and concentration camps. This is war. It is a fight to the death. The American people are relying upon you ladies and gentlemen for their protection against this sort of crime, just as much as they are relying upon the protection of the men who man the guns in Bataan Peninsula, and everywhere else. They are relying upon you ladies and gentlemen for their protection. We are at war. You have a duty to perform here. As a representative of your Government I am calling upon every one of you to do your duty. Id. at 247 n. 3, 63 S.Ct. at 566 n. 3. [3] The remarks in the instant case are analogous to the comments adjudged inflammatory and prejudicial in Viereck. The fairness or unfairness of comments appealing to the national or local community interests of jurors in a given instance will depend in great part on the nature of the community interest appealed to, and its relationship to, and the nature of, the wider social-political context to which it refers. The correlation between the community interest comments and the wider social-political context to a large extent controls the determination of whether an appeal is deemed impermissible because it is calculated to inflame passion and prejudice. The Supreme Court in Viereck framed the inquiry to incorporate both the purpose and effect of the comments. In that case, in the light of contemporaneous events, which had great impact on the emotions and perceptions of jurors, the remarks could only have ... arouse[d] passion and prejudice. See id. at 247, 63 S.Ct. at 566. In United States v. Barker, 553 F.2d 1013, 1024 25 (6th Cir.1977), in reviewing a conviction for bank robbery, we considered remarks which were found to have been deliberately made. These remarks were: [I]f you can't take this evidence and find these defendants guilty on this evidence that [sic] we might as well open all the banks and say, Come on and get the money, boys, because we'll never be able to convict them. Id. at 1025. We determined that it was beyond the bounds of propriety for a prosecutor to suggest that unless the defendant was convicted it would be impossible to maintain law and order in the jurors' community. Id. 3 The D.C. Circuit has applied this principle prohibiting appeals which are inflammatory in the contemporary climate to pleas against the drug problem in the ongoing drug war. United States v. Hawkins, 595 F.2d 751 (D.C.Cir.1978), cert. denied, 441 U.S. 910, 99 S.Ct. 2005, 60 L.Ed.2d 380 (1979). The D.C. Circuit stated that prosecutors are not at liberty to substitute emotion for evidence by equating, directly or by innuendo, a verdict of guilty to a blow against the drug problem. Id. at 754. 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 6 \f U.S. v. Solivan, 937 F.2d 1146 (1991) In United States v. Barlin, 686 F.2d 81 (2d Cir.1982), the Second Circuit found improper statements very similar to the ones alleged prejudicial in the instant case. In Barlin, the court found the prosecutor to *1153 have improperly appealed to the jury's passion and emotion in characterizing its job as the one occasion on which you have a duty to do something about the drug traffic in our community. Id. at 93. We agree with the Second Circuit's condemnation of this genre of comments designed to divert rather than focus the jury upon the evidence. See id. [4] We agree with the following statement by the court in United States v. Monaghan, 741 F.2d 1434 (D.C.Cir.1984), cert. denied, 470 U.S. 1085, 105 S.Ct. 1847, 85 L.Ed.2d 146 (1985), condemning appeals to the community interest to end a societal evil: lurking A prosecutor may not urge jurors to convict a criminal defendant in order to protect community values, preserve civil order, or deter future lawbreaking. The evil in such prosecutorial appeals is that the defendant will be convicted for reasons wholly irrelevant to his own guilt or innocence. Jurors may be persuaded by such appeals to believe that, by convicting a defendant, they will assist in the solution of some pressing social problem. The amelioration of society's woes is far too heavy a burden for the individual criminal defendant to bear. Id. at 1441. [5] In the instant case, we examine closely the substance of the prosecutor's statements to determine whether they were calculated to inflame. Our determination will depend on whether the statements appeal to community interests in light of current events and the nature of the specific case. In the case before us, the effect of the prosecutor's comments was to suggest to the jury that, because of defendant's participation in the drug trade in northern Kentucky, the drug problem facing the jurors' community would continue if they did not convict her. It is error for a prosecutor to direct the jurors' desires to end a social problem toward convicting a particular defendant. Even though this nation is in the midst of an ongoing crisis, popularly termed the War on Drugs, this crisis does not create an excuse to impinge on the constitutional right to a fair trial. We repeat what we stated in United States v. Radka, 904 F.2d 357 (6th Cir.1990): Presently, our nation is plagued with the destructive effects of the illegal importation and distribution of drugs. At this critical time, our Constitution remains a lodestar for the protections that shall endure the most pernicious affronts to our society.... The drug crisis does not license the aggrandizement of governmental power liberties. Despite the devastation wrought by drug trafficking in communities nationwide, we cannot suspend the precious rights guaranteed by the Constitution in an effort to fight the War on Drugs. lieu of civil in Id. at 361 (reversing a denial of a defendant's motion to suppress evidence obtained in a warrantless search of defendant's home because there were no exigent circumstances). Here, defendant's constitutional right to a fair trial was violated because the appeal to the community conscience in the context of the War on Drugs prejudicially impacted on her. The fear surrounding the War on Drugs undoubtedly influenced the jury by diverting its attention away from its task to weigh the evidence and submit a reasoned decision finding defendant guilty or innocent of the crimes with which she was charged. The substance of the statements made by the prosecutor in this case were designed, both in purpose and effect, to arouse passion and prejudice and to inflame the jurors' emotions regarding the War on Drugs by urging them to send a message and strike a blow to the drug problem. This nation faces a variety of social problems with which all citizens are daily confronted. The drug problem is one of the most compelling and devastating problems faced by this nation today. This Court is acutely aware of the 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 7 \f U.S. v. Solivan, 937 F.2d 1146 (1991) nature and extent of the drug problem. However, government prosecutors are not at liberty to urge jurors to convict defendants as blows to the drug problem faced by society or specifically, within their communities, or to send messages to all drug dealers. Such appeals are extremely prejudicial and harmful *1154 to the constitutional right to a fair trial. It should be clear from the foregoing discussion that, while not causing error per se unless the statements are deemed to be calculated to incite prejudice, prosecutors should exercise extreme caution when making any statement referring to the community interests of jurors. The government relies on United States v. Alloway, 397 F.2d 105 (6th Cir.1968), to provide an example of a similar instance of comments directed to the community conscience of jurors. In Alloway we reviewed a conviction for armed robbery of a Federal Savings & Loan Association. The defendant asserted that improper argument by the prosecutor should have resulted in a mistrial. We held that the following statements by the prosecutor did not exceed the permissible bounds of advocacy and that therefore the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's motion for a mistrial: You, the jurors, are called upon in this case to be the world conscience of the community. And I'm calling on this jury to speak out for the community and let the John Alloways know that this type of conduct will not be tolerated, that we're not going to tolerate [armed robbery].... 397 F.2d at 113. The district court in Alloway subsequently instructed the jury to base its verdict solely on the evidence and to consider the prosecutor's argument only as it corresponded with the evidence. Id. The comments by the prosecutor in Alloway and the comments complained of in the instant case are only vaguely similar. The remarks in this case appear to us to have been deliberately injected into the proceedings to incite the jury against defendant. Given the nature of this case, involving a cocaine transaction, and the wider social context which the prosecutor sought to bring to bear on the proceedings, the national drug problem, the purpose and effect of the comments could have only been to arouse passion and prejudice. See Viereck, 318 U.S. at 247, 63 S.Ct. at 566. We determined that the statements made in Alloway were not deliberately injected into the proceedings to inflame the jury. See 397 F.2d at 113. Indeed, examined in the light of the nature of the case and the wider social context in which the case was prosecuted, it is clear that the government's statements in Alloway were devoid of the sort of inflammatory content inherent in the prosecutor's statements in this case precisely because there was no comparable specific wider context of national attention and concern present in Alloway pertaining to armed robbery. The comments in Alloway did not attempt to compare or to associate the defendant with a feared and highly publicized group, such as drug dealers, as did the prosecutor in this case. The prosecutor in Alloway did not go beyond a mere allusion to the general need to convict guilty people, as did the prosecutor in this case, and bring to bear upon the jury's deliberations the attendant social consequences of defendant's criminal conduct or urge the jury to convict an individual defendant in an effort to ameliorate society's woes. Here, the prosecutor honed in on the illegal drug trade, which is the specific focus of much national attention, concern and fear. Thus, in Alloway, we were not presented with a context similar to the context of the case before us now. This case involves a woman charged with possession of cocaine with intent to distribute cocaine, among other charges. The wider social, political reality into which the prosecutor impermissibly sought to insert the case is the highly publicized, national and international drug trade. The prosecutor brought to bear upon the jury's decision whether to convict defendant the pervasive fear of drugs and the attendant dangers of drugs and drug addiction. The almost daily attention given by the media and politicians to the drug trade and gang violence, for example, have heightened the nation's awareness of, and hardened its attitudes towards, the drug problem. Thus, the prosecutor's appeal to the jury to convict a defendant as a blow to the drug problem or to send messages to drug dealers cannot be other than highly prejudicial given the specific context of the case in the current social-political environment. *1155 In Alloway, we were presented with remarks by the prosecutor which alluded only to the general criminality of the defendant's conduct in robbing a bank and the general community need to convict guilty people. The comments at issue in Alloway constituted a general plea which did 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 8 \f U.S. v. Solivan, 937 F.2d 1146 (1991) not even specifically refer to the crime of armed robbery. Moreover, armed robbery was not and is not the specific focus of national attention as is the drug problem. In the instant case, we find that Alloway is inapposite because, in this case, the prosecutor went beyond the scope of the prosecutor's statements in Alloway, which constituted a mere innocuous reference to the community or societal need to convict guilty people. The prosecutor in the instant case went beyond stating the obvious, and went so far as to urge the jury to send a message to the community, to defendant and all of the drug dealers like her by convicting defendant. The prosecutor suggested to the jury that convicting defendant would help keep its community in northern Kentucky free of the drug trade by sending the message that we don't want that stuff in Northern Kentucky and that anybody who brings that stuff ... presumably would be convicted just like defendant in this case. We determine that the prosecutor improperly injected the spectre of an influx of cocaine dealers into the jurors' community in an attempt to appeal to the jurors' emotions, passions and prejudices against the drug problem. See generally United States v. Love, 534 F.2d 87, 89 (6th Cir.1976) (finding reversible misconduct where prosecutor intentionally and for no legitimate purpose injected into the trial the spectre of organized crime and the Mafia). Thus, we conclude that the complained of remarks by the prosecutor in this case constitute error. The remarks were isolated to one portion of the trial, closing argument. However, this fact does not ameliorate their prejudicial impact; the remarks were misleading, inflammatory and prejudiced defendant's right to a fair trial. D. 1. [6] Having determined that the prosecutor's remarks were prejudicial to defendant's right to a fair trial and thus constituted error, we now turn to examine whether such error was harmless. [7] Our review of a claim of prosecutorial misconduct on appeal is guided by the standards set forth in Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967), to determine whether constitutional error is harmless error or whether reversible error has resulted from improper evidence or improper argument to the jury. In Chapman, the Supreme Court held that errors at trial, even federal constitutional errors, do not require automatic reversal of a conviction if the error can be classified as harmless. It is incumbent upon the government to demonstrate that such constitutional error, resulting from the admission of highly prejudicial evidence or comment, is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Id. at 24, 87 S.Ct. at 828. If there is a reasonable possibility that the evidence or comment complained of might have contributed to the conviction, then such error cannot be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. See id. at 23 24, 87 S.Ct. at 827 28 (relying on Fahy v. Connecticut, 375 U.S. 85, 84 S.Ct. 229, 11 L.Ed.2d 171 (1963)); Coury v. Livesay, 868 F.2d 842, 845 46 (6th Cir.1989) (applying the Chapman harmless error analysis to determine whether the error affected the result). [8] The result of a harmless error analysis depends on the circumstances of the particular case. Phelps v. Duckworth, 772 F.2d 1410, 1413 (7th Cir.) (en banc), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 1011, 106 S.Ct. 541, 88 L.Ed.2d 471 (1985); United States v. Shue, 766 F.2d 1122, 1132 (7th Cir.1985). Determining whether an error is reversible necessitates examination of the entire record. See United States v. Hasting, 461 U.S. 499, 509, 103 S.Ct. 1974, 1980, 76 L.Ed.2d 96 (1983). Hasting reiterated the Supreme Court's recognition that given the myriad safeguards provided to assure a fair trial, and taking into account the reality of the human fallibility of the participants, there can be no such thing as an *1156 error free, perfect trial, and that the Constitution does not guarantee such a trial. Id. at 508 09, 103 S.Ct. at 1980. 2. [9] The government urges us to find that the prosecutor's comments were fair comment based upon the evidence and were cured by an admonition from the trial judge. Prosecutorial missteps have been held harmless in light of the relative strength of the evidence or because instructions given by the trial court sufficiently diluted or eradicated any resulting prejudice. See United States v. Hawkins, 595 F.2d 751, 754 55 (D.C.Cir.1978), cert. denied, 441 U.S. 910, 99 S.Ct. 2005, 60 L.Ed.2d 380 (1979). Regardless of the strength of the case against defendant, the instructions given by the 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 9 \f U.S. v. Solivan, 937 F.2d 1146 (1991) district court were insufficient and came too late to mitigate the negative and highly prejudicial impact of the remarks on the jurors' minds, especially since the remarks were among the final arguments presented to the jurors prior to their deliberations. [10] When isolated remarks are made in the course of a long trial and the jury is given an appropriate cautionary instruction designed to overcome any prejudice that may have been caused, the error may be harmless. We examine the curative effect, if any, of the cautionary instruction to the jury in the light of the degree and effect of the prejudice. However, an error may be so prejudicial that no cautionary instruction, however swiftly and forcibly given, can safely eradicate its effect. See Pierce v. United States, 86 F.2d 949, 952 53 (6th Cir.1936). In Pierce, we articulated the method for testing prejudice where a cautionary instruction has been given to a jury because of improper argument by a prosecutor: The inquiry ... must always be as to whether in view of the whole record the impression conveyed to the minds of jurors by irrelevant and prejudicial matter is such that the court may fairly say that it has not been successfully eradicated by the rulings of the trial judge, his admonition to counsel, and his instruction to the jurors to disregard it. Id. at 952. Similarly, in Ippolito v. United States, 108 F.2d 668, 670 71 (6th Cir.1940), we stated that appeals to the passion and prejudice of a jury, while constituting error, do not require reversal unless such error affects the substantial rights of parties. Id. at 670. We recognized, as we do here, that a single instance of error may be so destructive of a defendant's right to a fair trial that reversal must follow. Id. at 671. In United States v. Ashworth, 836 F.2d 260, 267 (6th Cir.1988), we adopted the Ninth Circuit's analysis in United States v. Flake, 746 F.2d 535 (9th Cir.1984), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1225, 105 S.Ct. 1220, 84 L.Ed.2d 360 (1985). The Flake court framed the question of whether a new trial is warranted as whether improprieties in counsel's argument to the jury were so gross as to probably prejudice the defendant and whether any resulting prejudice was not neutralized by the trial judge's instruction or admonition to the jury. Id. at 542. The court in Flake found that improprieties in the prosecutor's argument to the jury were improper but not gross, and in any case were followed swiftly by the court's admonition and the prosecutor's apology and personal request that the jury heed the court's instructions. Ashworth involved an appeal from the defendants' convictions for conspiracy and arson. The Ashworth court applied the Flake approach to determine whether prejudice resulted from improper prosecutorial comment on a fact not in evidence and whether such comment was cured by an admonition from the court. In argument to the jury, the prosecutor referred to prior statements by two co-defendants to the effect that they denied talking to each other on the night of the fire. On appeal, we concluded that the prosecutor's comment was not so gross as to probably prejudice the defendants and that any slight prejudice resulting from the improper argument was neutralized by the court's cautionary instruction to the jury that the attorneys' arguments were not evidence. Ashworth, 836 F.2d at 267. *1157 In this case, we find the comments made by the prosecutor during closing argument to have been so gross as to probably prejudice defendant. We also find that the trial court's admonition to the jury did not neutralize the prejudice resulting from such comments. Therefore, we cannot conclude that there is no reasonable possibility that the comments did not contribute to defendant's conviction. [11] Both the timing and the firmness of the trial court's admonition are relevant in evaluating whether an admonition has been sufficient to mitigate prejudicial error. In Bess we found the timing of the trial judge's admonition relevant. In finding improper remarks by the prosecutor to constitute reversible error, we noted that the objectionable remarks were promptly objected to, but that the trial judge failed to give an immediate curative admonition. 593 F.2d at 757. In Bess we stressed that corrective measures should be taken immediately in instances of prosecutorial misconduct so as to ameliorate any resulting prejudice. Id. at 757 n. 10. While the trial judge in this case did admonish the jury, the admonition given to the jury took place after a twenty-minute recess which occurred immediately following the prosecutor's improper statements. As the defense counsel stated, these comments were allowed to become etched in granite in the 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 10 \f U.S. v. Solivan, 937 F.2d 1146 (1991) jurors' minds. The admonition given by the district court in this case was given too late to eradicate the prejudice from the jurors' minds. Moreover, the misconduct which took place in the instant case called for stern rebuke and repressive measures. Berger v. United States, 295 U.S. 78, 85, 55 S.Ct. 629, 632, 79 L.Ed. 1314 (1935). In cases where an admonition has been found to mitigate or remove the taint of prejudicial prosecutorial misconduct, the admonition has been swiftly given and firm. See Phelps v. Duckworth, 772 F.2d 1410, 1413 14 (7th Cir.) (en banc), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 1011, 106 S.Ct. 541, 88 L.Ed.2d 471 (1985). In Phelps, the jury was admonished twice to correct the prejudicial statements. Id. Moreover, in Phelps, the jury was admonished immediately. The admonition in this case was neither swiftly given nor did it sufficiently convey to the jury a sense of judicial disapproval of the remarks to dispel the harmful content and impact of the prosecutor's egregious statements. Even were the district court to have immediately and appropriately admonished the jury to disregard the remarks, we doubt seriously that any cautionary instruction could have safely eradicated the highly prejudicial effect of the prosecutor's statements in this case. The statements were deliberately injected into the proceedings to inflame the jurors' emotions and fears associated with the current drug epidemic that is reported daily in our newspapers and which threatens the very fabric of our society. Cf. United States v. Love, 534 F.2d 87, 89 (6th Cir.1976) (finding the trial judge's effort to neutralize prejudicial government comments ineffective and reversing the defendant's conviction where prosecutor intentionally injected into the trial the spectre of organized crime and the Mafia). The statements were so inflammatory in the context of the ongoing drug war that no charge could have sufficiently cured the prejudice. In the instant case, we cannot say that the government has demonstrated, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the prejudicial comments did not contribute to the defendant's conviction. As we have stated previously, [d]ue process does not require perfect trials but it mandates fair ones. Love, 534 F.2d at 89. III. that find the egregious prosecutorial Because we misconduct which occurred in this case did not constitute harmless error, we conclude that the district court abused its discretion in denying defendant's motion for a mistrial. Accordingly, the judgment and sentence against defendant are REVERSED and this case is REMANDED for a new trial consistent with this opinion. Footnotes 1 The trial transcript reveals that the following dialogue took place out of the presence of the jury immediately after the Assistant U.S. Attorney concluded his closing argument: The Court: All right. You have a state your motion and your objection. [Defense Counsel]: Your Honor, comes now the defendant Rosalba Solivan and based on counsel's comment in closing argument with respect to her other activities and the drug business of which there's no significant The Court: Can't hear you. [Defense Counsel]: of which there's no significance or substantial evidence, as well as his last comment, and that to send a message to the other drug dealers in Northern Kentucky that's clearly an appeal to the community interest of this jury. It is extremely predudicial to make that type of comment that you have to lock her up and send a message. It's kind of like giving a punitive damage argument in a straight negligence case, this send-a-message type argument. It's extremely prejudicial given the nature of the publicity about Columbia, the nature of the political situation, the the repeated references in the newspapers, in the media to the drug problem, the President's speech on drugs. A gallup poll has shown that [for] the majority of Americans, this [sic] [is] their number one concern right now, all these things in this climate in this time, that type of comment is overkill. It's prejudicial, and we respectfully move for a mistrial. The Court: All right. Sustain the motion for a mistrial. I think it's probably going a little too far. I think it's overwhelming the motion has two parts. I think there's a lot of evidence of that in there which counsel can put on the characterization she was in the drug business, as he has spelled out. But I don't think you can should be asking the jury to send anybody messages. It's the duty of the jury to convict if there's proof beyond a reasonable doubt and to acquit if there isn't proof beyond a reasonable doubt, and the jury will be so admonished. 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 11 \f U.S. v. Solivan, 937 F.2d 1146 (1991) However, in the light of all the evidence I think it can be cured by an admonition. I don't think a little rhetoric if cured by an admonition of the Court is going to taint the whole trial, during which counsel has been afforded counsel for the defense has been afforded great liberality. As you know, we were inclined not to give the entrapment instruction at all. You got that. [Defense Counsel]: I would have The Court: I think you've had a very fair trial and we will cure this with an admonition. He didn't get very far with it before you interrupted him. * * * * * * The Court: It's the part about sending the message that I find objectionable. [Defense Counsel]: The part about sending the message is amplified The Court: It's not their duty to send messages. It's their duty to acquit or convict if there's evidence beyond a reasonable doubt and acquit if there isn't evidence beyond a reasonable doubt. I'm going to tell them that when they get back. [Defense Counsel]: Well, without waiving our motion, we would ask for the instruction. I don't think it's going to cure it. The Court: I think it will cure it. [Defense Counsel]: It's going to be etched in granite on these jurors' minds. The Court: Going to be what? [Defense Counsel]: Etched in granite. It's going to be like trying to unring a bell. It's been told to them. He's gotten his message across. He's gone to the community interests, the other drug problems and other drug dealers. I think it's just a grievous error, Judge. The only way it can be rectified is to declare a mistrial. The Court: Well, you made your motion. I'll overrule the motion. I'll correct it. I think it can be corrected with an admonition. And to my observation of the jury you had a very fair trial, I think. We've been more liberal with you than with most people as far as the time we've allowed you to take and everything. I think it can be cured with an admonition. I'll do it when we get back. About ten more minutes. Transcript at 768 71. Our holding in Henderson and the result reached in Alloway reflect a general rule followed by other circuits as well. In United States v. Shirley, 435 F.2d 1076 (7th Cir.1970), the Seventh Circuit stated that the prosecutor's closing remarks concerning the increasing number of cars being stolen did not overstep the bounds of fairness and propriety and could not have worked a substantial injury to the defendant in denying him a fair trial because, even though the statements were not particularly relevant and had no bearing on the guilt or innocence of the defendant, the remarks did not contain an emotional appeal to the jurors' self-interest designed to arouse their prejudice against the defendant. Id. at 1079. The Eighth Circuit has also stated, in a case where the prosecutor told the jurors that they were the public's last shield and the district court instructed the jury to disregard the remark, that unless calculated to inflame, an appeal to the jury to act as the conscience of the community is not impermissible. United States v. Lewis, 547 F.2d 1030, 1036 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 1111, 97 S.Ct. 1149, 51 L.Ed.2d 566 (1976). Similarly, the Eleventh Circuit, in United States v. Kopituk, 690 F.2d 1289, 1342 43 (11th Cir.1982), cert. denied, 463 U.S. 1209, 103 S.Ct. 3542, 77 L.Ed.2d 1391 (1983), stated that appeals to the jury to act as the conscience of the community, unless designed to inflame the jury, are not per se impermissible. However, the remarks complained of in Kopituk were found by the court to have approached the line demarcating impermissible comment calculated to incite the jury against the accused, but not to have crossed the line into the realm of impropriety and prejudice by directly suggesting that the jurors had personal stakes in the outcome of the case. Similar reasoning was applied in Brown v. United States, 370 F.2d 242 (D.C.Cir.1966), a case involving a criminal prosecution of an African American youth for assault based on a confrontation between the defendant and two police officers. The court found the prosecutor's community appeal improper. During closing argument, the prosecutor warned the jury that to acquit the defendant would leave the police powerless to protect themselves and citizens against assault short of resort to martial law. In condemning these remarks, and in reversing the defendant's conviction, the D.C. Circuit found that such an argument was an appeal wholly irrelevant to any facts or issues in the case. Id. at 246 (relying on Viereck, 318 U.S. at 247, 63 S.Ct. at 566, and Berger, 295 U.S. at 88, 55 S.Ct. at 633). Further, the court stated that the prosecutor's argument raised the spectre of martial law and therefore constituted an especially flagrant and reprehensible appeal to passion and prejudice in the context of current events (i.e., the social unrest of the late 1960s). 2015 Thomson Reuters.

This matter is before the court on motions to dismiss the superseding indictment against defendants LUTHER LANGFORD TAYLOR, LARRY BLANDING and BENJAMIN J. GORDON, JR., and the indictments against defendants PAUL WAYNE DERRICK and JEFFERSON MARION LONG, JR., on the grounds of prosecutorial, agency and/or investigative misconduct. Each defendant in these cases has joined in the motions of the other defendants. All of these defendants are back before this court for retrials on remand from the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. the motions, The court has reviewed each of the memorandums in support of and in opposition thereto, the transcripts of the various hearings, and the numerous exhibits attached to the memorandums and filed with the court in support of oral arguments. 1 The court is convinced that the totality of the government's actions in these matters rises to the level of egregious prosecutorial misconduct, and that this is a sufficient finding on which the court can exercise its supervisory power. A tedious analysis of the case law has not provided any clear standards or guidelines for the dismissal of indictments when the government has been found guilty of misconduct. It does appear to be clearly established that the dismissal of an indictment is a drastic step; however, the court believes it has the discretion under the doctrine of the court's supervisory power to dismiss should it find the government's actions so outrageous as to offend the sensibilities of the court. The government would argue that in using its supervisory power the court must find pattern and prejudice, and that the defendants have proven neither. The court agrees that the circuits are in disarray on this subject, but believes there is sufficient precedent to dismiss the subject indictments without addressing these issues. A fuller discussion *624 of its authority under the supervisory power doctrine will be found at the conclusion of this order. I have wrestled with some sanction short of dismissal, but find that the only remedy available to these defendants that would be commensurate with the misconduct of the government is in the dismissal of these indictments. I am of the opinion that the nature and breadth of its misconduct is indicative of the drastic steps the prosecution took to win these cases, and that the resultant injustice to these defendants cannot be fully remedied by new trials. Therefore, the court must take the equally drastic step of invoking its supervisory power to dismiss these indictments with prejudice. I. PROCEDURAL HISTORY These cases arise from an FBI investigation of drugs and corruption in the South Carolina State House, code-named OPERATION LOST TRUST, that eventually involved some twenty-eight State legislators, lobbyists and others. In early 1988, Special Agent Michael S. Clemens of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Columbia, South Carolina, office, commenced an investigation of drug violations by members of the South Carolina State Legislature. On April 28, 1989, a registered South Carolina lobbyist, Ronald L. Cobb, was apprehended by the FBI after attempting to invest in a drug deal with an undercover agent. When approached by Clemens and other FBI agents, Cobb, realizing he had been caught in the commission of a felony, told the agents he could help them with a far more serious problem political corruption in the State House. The FBI was in possession of some historical evidence of political corruption in the State House at that time, but had never developed sufficient evidence to indict any legislators or lobbyists. Cobb was given the opportunity to avoid prosecution for the drug deal in exchange for becoming a paid confidential informant. 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 2 \f U.S. v. Taylor, 956 F.Supp. 622 (1997) Over the next several months, the details of a sting operation were developed with Cobb's assistance. It was ultimately determined to utilize a pari-mutuel betting bill then before the legislature; to set Cobb up as the lobbyist for a bogus corporation known as The Alpha Group, and to have Cobb let it be known that he had funds available for those legislators who would assist him in the passage of this legislation. The resulting corruption charges of Conspiracy to Commit Extortion under Color of Official Right and Extortion under Color of Official Right against these and some of the other defendants were brought pursuant to the Hobbs Act, Title 18, United States Code Section 1951. Other defendants were indicted on drug charges pursuant to various sections of Title 21, United States Code. On August 24, 1990, the first of the criminal indictments, No. 3:90 339, was returned against defendant LUTHER LANGFORD TAYLOR, a member of the S.C. House of Representatives, charging him with one count of conspiracy to commit extortion and five substantive counts of extortion, and ROBERT ALFRED KOHN, also a member of the S.C. House, charging him in the conspiracy count. Kohn pled guilty on September 26, 1990. On September 19, 1990, Taylor 2 filed a motion to dismiss the indictment on the grounds of prosecutorial, agency and/ or investigative misconduct, which was heard and taken under advisement on September 24, 1990. A supporting memorandum was filed on October 1, 1990; the government filed its opposition on October 4th, and the motion was denied by this court on October 9, 1990. On October 15, 1990, the trial of Taylor commenced, and on October 25th he was found guilty on all six counts of the indictment. Taylor's post-trial motions were denied, and he was sentenced to seventy-eight months on each of the six counts, the said sentences to run concurrently. Taylor appealed his conviction. Bond pending appeal, vigorously opposed by the government, was denied. *625 During this time, on September 21, 1990, a six- count indictment, No. 3:90 434, was returned against Ennis Maurice Fant, Larry Blanding and Benjamin J. Gordon, also members of the State House of Representatives. These defendants, likewise, filed a joint motion to dismiss for prosecutorial misconduct on November 7, 1990, to which the government responded on November 15, 1990. The motion was denied at a hearing on November 19, 1990. Fant pled guilty to the conspiracy count of the indictment on February 22, 1991, and trial proceeded as to Blanding and Gordon on February 25, 1991. On the first day of trial Gordon filed another motion to dismiss for prosecutorial misconduct, which was denied. Guilty verdicts as to both defendants were returned on March 7, 1991. After two hearings, their motions for acquittal and new trial were denied on August 7, 1991. Blanding was sentenced the following month to thirty-seven months each on the conspiracy count and two substantive counts of extortion, said sentences to run concurrently, and remained on bond until he commenced serving his sentence upon designation by the Bureau of Prisons. Defendant Gordon's sentencing on one count of conspiracy and one substantive count of extortion was postponed as the result of contested legal issues relating to sentencing and, subsequently, the defendant's health. Both defendants appealed their convictions. Defendant Paul Wayne Derrick was indicted on February 20, 1991, by a two-count criminal indictment charging conspiracy to commit extortion and extortion under color of official right, # 3:91 0091, and went to trial on May 1, 1991. On May 11th he was found guilty on both counts and was sentenced to thirty-four months on each count, said sentences to run concurrently. Derrick appealed this conviction and has remained free on bond. Defendant Jefferson Marion Long, Jr. was a member of the South Carolina Senate who was indicted in a two-count Indictment, # 3:91 0394, charging conspiracy to commit extortion and extortion under color of official right, on August 20, 1991. Trial commenced on November 12th; his motion for a directed verdict was granted as to Count 1 on November 22nd, and the jury returned a guilty verdict as to Count 2 on November 23, 1991. On March 26, 1992, this court granted this defendant's motion for a new trial, which order was appealed by the government. Long has since remained free on bond. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals found that the jury charge given in the Taylor, Blanding and Gordon, and Derrick cases, to be in conflict with the subsequent holdings in McCormick v. United States, 500 U.S. 257, 111 S.Ct. 1807, 114 L.Ed.2d 307 (1991) (on the issue of quid pro quo), and Evans v. United States, 504 U.S. 255, 112 S.Ct. 1881, 119 L.Ed.2d 57 (1992) (on the issue of inducement), and remanded these three cases for re-trial. See, USA v. Taylor, 2015 Thomson Reuters.

In another unpublished opinion, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed this court's decision granting a new trial in USA v. Long, No. 92 6799; 1994 WL 56993 (4th Cir. Feb. 25, 1994). Following remand, both Taylor and Blanding were released on bond. This court then granted Gordon a new trial on August 6, 1993. 3 On July 1, 1993, this court issued an order for a statewide jury to be selected on August 16, 1993, in the retrial of Taylor. By order of August 2, 1993, trial was continued to November 8, 1993. On August 18, 1993, the government filed a Superseding Indictment which consolidated the Taylor case with the Gordon and Blanding case. Taylor filed on September 29, 1993, the motion now still pending before this court to dismiss the superseding indictment on grounds of double jeopardy, claiming prosecutorial and/or agency misconduct, which motion *626 the government opposed on October 6, 1993. On October 19, 1993, the trial of the three defendants was continued to December 6, 1993, principally due to Gordon's health. Again on October 26, 1993, the trial was continued to the first available term following January 1, 1994. On November 29, 1993, however, the defendants received volumes of discovery material not previously furnished them by the government. 4 As a result, Taylor filed several supplemental Brady motions, and on February 20, 1994, he filed a supplemental memorandum in further support of his dismissal motion. Gordon filed his motion to dismiss on February 22, 1994. 5 At this point, the United States Attorney for the District of South Carolina 6 sought an order of continuance and requested an investigation by the Department of Justice's Office of Professional Responsibility (DOJ/OPR). 7 On October 19, 1994, the U.S. Attorney for South Carolina recused his office from any further involvement in the cases, and attorneys from the Public Integrity Section of the Department of Justice were assigned as substitute counsel for the government. [1] On October 20, 1994, a status conference was held on the within cases. Each defendant joined in the motions of the others, and discovery was consolidated with regard to the motions only. The court established an Evidence Room wherein the government 8 was ordered to place all discovery materials and make them available to these defendants. 9 The defendants continued to file motions for additional discovery, and a hearing on Taylor's and Gordon's discovery motions filed March 15 and 17, 1995, was held in Columbia on April 19, 1995. This hearing resulted in the court issuing an order filed April 20, 1995, which stated in part: To avoid any further confusion as to what material should and should not be turned over by the government to the above defendants, it is ORDERED, that all documents and/or materials in possession of the government dealing with these cases and not presently available to the defendants in the evidence room be produced by the government directly to the court at Charleston, South Carolina, not later than Monday, May 8, 1995, for in camera inspection by the court.... [Order, 4/20/95, pp. 2 3]. inspection of Following an extensive the documents submitted to the court, the court *627 issued its order on July 25, 1995; and, following later submissions by the government, discovery orders were filed September 7 and October 6, 1995. On October 18 through 20, 1995, the court held another hearing in Columbia. At this hearing, additional government files came to light and the defendants argued with specificity for reconsideration of portions of the court's order of July 25, 1995. They further requested FBI computer-generated printouts of the inventories of the FBI's entire Lost Trust and Capital Gains 10 investigatory files, which resulted in Taylor filing an additional motion on January 19, 1996. Following a second lengthy in camera inspection by the court, and in response to Taylor's January 1996 motion, the court issued an order on February 6, 1996. At that time, the court ordered that the hearing held in recess since the previous October be reconvened on March 11, 1996, at which time all parties were to be prepared to present 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 4 \f U.S. v. Taylor, 956 F.Supp. 622 (1997) and complete testimony and arguments with regard to the motions to dismiss now pending before this court. The government subsequently moved on February 14, 1996, for reconsideration of the February 6th order, to which the defendant Taylor filed an objection, and the court ruled on this motion by order of February 23, 1996. The health of defendant Gordon continued to be an issue, and his counsel sought a continuance of the March 11, 1996, hearing date. The continuance was granted; however, on May 24, 1996, the court, following a telephone conference with all parties, conditionally severed the defendant Gordon 11 and reset oral arguments on the dismissal motions for May 29, 1996. On the day prior to that scheduled hearing, May 28th, the undersigned judicial officer suffered a heart attack and underwent angioplastic surgery on that date, and again on June 28th and August 19th. Thus, the hearing was not reconvened until October 3, 1996. Following a full day's hearing on October 3rd, the parties were given the opportunity to submit in writing any additional argument on matters in evidence on or before October 18th. The court received a letter under date of October 8, 1996, from the attorney for Taylor, and the government filed a memorandum on October 18, 1996, to which were attached Affidavits from former U.S. Attorney E. Bart Daniel, former Assistant U.S. Attorney Dale L. DuTremble, and Assistant U.S. Attorney John M. Barton, the chief prosecutors in these cases. 12 By letter under date of October 24, 1996, to the court, Derrick's attorney lodged a protest to the filing of the three Affidavits as an attempt by the government to add to the record after the close of the hearing, and the court ruled that the Affidavits would not be considered. The joint motions of the above defendants to dismiss the superseding indictment as to Taylor, Blanding and Gordon and the indictments as to Derrick and Long on the grounds of double jeopardy and prosecutorial, agency and/or investigative misconduct are now ready for a ruling by this court. II. DEFENDANTS' MOTIONS TO DISMISS Some three to four weeks prior to the commencement of his trial, Taylor filed his first motion to dismiss on the grounds of investigative agency and prosecutorial misconduct in which he charged (1) that the government's presentation to the Grand Jury was legally insufficient and exculpatory evidence was withheld, (2) that the conduct of the U.S. Attorney with regard to pretrial publicity had been improper, and (3) that the government engaged in fundamentally unfair investigative practices. Following a hearing and additional memorandums, this court denied his motion. [Order, 10/9/90]. Likewise, a joint motion was filed prior to trial by defendants Fant, Blanding and Gordon to dismiss for prosecutorial misconduct *628 or, in the alternative, for sanctions, on the grounds (1) that the government violated an order of the court concerning pre-trial publicity, and (2) that the government violated the Code of Federal Regulations governing the release of information in criminal actions by personnel of the Department of Justice. The motion was denied at a hearing on November 19, 1990. 13 On the day jury selection commenced in the Blanding/Gordon case, 14 February 25, 1991, the defendant Gordon filed a motion to dismiss for prosecutorial misconduct on the ground that Brady material furnished by the government only three days earlier 15 would show that the government's key witness had perjured himself both at the Taylor trial and before the Grand Jury and that the government had taken no steps to correct the matter. The motion was denied by this court at a hearing on March 1, 1991. The cases proceeded to trial, conviction, and remand on appeal. Prior to retrial, however, on September 29, 1993, Taylor filed a motion to dismiss on the grounds (1) that the government had withheld evidence both exculpatory in nature and favorable to Taylor in violation of the letter and spirit of the Brady case, and (2) that during the original trial proceedings the government generated extensive, prejudicial pre-trial publicity, thus denying defendant a fair trial in violation of the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. At a hearing on October 12, 1993, the court took the motion under advisement. On February 12, 1994, Taylor filed a supplemental memorandum which informed the court that he had received from the government under date of November 29, 1993, a substantial number of documents and tapes never seen before. In the memorandum, Taylor identifies recently received materials which he claims overwhelmingly establish the extent and scope of the government's violations of its responsibilities under Brady at the time of his first trial. He 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 5 \f U.S. v. Taylor, 956 F.Supp. 622 (1997) cites to specific pre-trial discovery sought via five Brady motions. Additionally, he claims that the theories of his defense were disclosed prior to trial so that the government cannot claim that it failed to see the exculpatory nature of the evidence sought but not disclosed; that defendant made an ample, if not overwhelming, record of his Brady requests; that rather than disclose the evidence it had which could be used to impeach its witnesses, the government sought to preclude the issue, and that during the trial defendant made further requests for Brady material to which the government attorneys made deceitful responses, thereby breaching their duty as officers of the court. On February 22, 1994, defendant Gordon filed his motion to dismiss the superseding indictment on the grounds (1) that the government intentionally withheld certain Brady material during his first trial, (2) that the government lied to the court about the existence of the Brady material, and (3) that the government allowed perjured testimony to be presented to the court. Derrick filed his motion claiming prosecutorial misconduct in the withholding of Brady materials on April 19, 1995, and supplemented this motion on September 5, 1995. Taylor filed a Second Supplemental Memorandum to his motion to dismiss on August 25, 1995, in which he expands his argument that the government was guilty of outrageous misconduct in that, among other things, it failed to supervise adequately a paid government informer, disregarded FBI regulations by questioning a target without Miranda warnings, delayed in transcribing interviews of witnesses, allowed false declarations before the Grand Jury and false testimony at trial which it did not correct, communicated with the defendant after trial without prior notice to his counsel, participated in prejudicial pretrial publicity, engaged in a pattern of conduct calculated to infringe on the Grand Jury's ability to exercise independent judgment; *629 misrepresented facts proven false by documents later found in the government's file, failed to present exculpatory evidence to the Grand Jury, withheld prior exculpatory testimony and misrepresented to the court and the defense that the prior testimony existed; tainted the proceedings by misrepresentations and indiscretions of government agents, failed to provide proper warning to a Grand Jury target prior to his testifying before the Grand Jury, and perjury by a government agent. A Third Supplemental Memorandum was filed by Taylor on March 28, 1996, following access to discovery materials furnished by direction of this court's order of February 6, 1996, as amended by order filed February 23, 1996. Taylor argues here that the new materials prove (1) that throughout this sting operation the government violated its own representations, the instructions it was required to follow, and the rules designed to insure fairness; (2) the perjury of Ron Cobb and Agent Clemens, as well as the false statements and arguments of the government attorneys, and (3) willful Brady violations. He further contends that this material contains new Brady material of which defendants had no prior knowledge. The defendants previously have taken issue with the handling of the investigation by the Department of Justice Office of Professional Responsibility (DOJ/OPR) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation Office of Professional Responsibility (FBI/OPR) after the OPR reports were furnished to the defendants in January of 1995. Taylor's letter submission of October 8, 1996, includes a summary of his allegations that the pattern of misconduct extends beyond the local FBI and U.S. Attorney's offices to a pattern of dissembling by FBI Headquarters and the Department of Justice as well. III. GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSES TO MOTIONS TO DISMISS The government responded on October 6, 1993, to Taylor's motion to dismiss of September 29, 1993. These documents were filed following remand but prior to recusal by the U.S. Attorney for the District of South Carolina and prior to the government furnishing additional discovery materials to the defendant on November 29, 1993. The government's response was prepared by AUSA Barton, who states therein: The United States not only vehemently denies these allegations but also maintains that even if true, neither the Fifth these allegations nor Amendment any basis the Superseding for dismissal of Indictment in this case. provide 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 6 \f U.S. v. Taylor, 956 F.Supp. 622 (1997) [Gov's. Response to Def. Taylor's Motion to Dismiss Indictment, 10/6/93, p. 1]. In its argument against the allegation of the suppression of exculpatory evidence being material to the outcome of the trial, the government states that the defendant Taylor failed to show that there was a reasonable probability that the result of the trial would have been different had the evidence been disclosed; and, further, that defendant did not make full use of the information available to him, and thus no Brady violation occurred. The government also argues that Taylor has abjectly failed to support his extensive, prejudicial publicity assertion. As to defendant's Fifth Amendment double jeopardy claim, the government relies on the finding in United States v. Borokinni, 748 F.2d 236 (4th Cir.1984), and concludes that, even if Taylor's alleged Brady violations were accurately stated and that the information was willfully withheld by the government, the Fifth Amendment's double jeopardy would not provide a basis for the dismissal of the indictment. Following the receipt by defendant of additional discovery on November 29, 1993, as mentioned above, Taylor filed a supplemental memorandum on February 10, 1994, and Gordon filed his motion to dismiss on February 22, 1994; the matter was referred to the DOJ/OPR for investigation and attorneys from the Public Integrity Section, Criminal Division, of the DOJ were substituted for the U.S. Attorney's Office in South Carolina. In opposition to both Taylor's and Gordon's motions and memorandums, an extensive memorandum was filed on the government's behalf on October 31, 1994, by Daniel J. Butler, Senior Trial Attorney, and other DOJ attorneys. *630 The Butler memorandum reiterates the government's previous argument that there has been no showing of intentional government misconduct or longstanding pattern of misconduct. The government argues that the defendants' contentions primarily relate to the non-production of two FBI FD 302s, 16 and cites to the Fourth Circuit's ruling in USA v. Taylor, 966 F.2d at 837, where the court, in response to the defendant's claim that the government did not produce all evidence bearing on witness Cobb's credibility, held that ... [Taylor] is now aware of this evidence and may use it as the Rules of Evidence may provide at his retrial. The government claims that other Brady violation claims by the defendants, such as Cobb's use of cocaine, witness Robert Kohn's 17 use and sale of cocaine, other video-and audio-tapes of Kohn and other taped interviews of co-conspirators, can also be remedied by a new trial. In response to other defense allegations, the government denies that there was any intentional misleading of the court or the defendant and no knowing presentation of perjured testimony. The government also makes its argument as to the requirement that the defendants must show prejudice, which it claims they have not done, and presents an argument against defendants' exclusive reliance on the case of United States v. Shafer, 987 F.2d 1054 (4th Cir.1993), for dismissal of the superseding indictment on double jeopardy grounds and against defendants' argument for dismissal based on the court's supervisory powers. Subsequent to the above filings and as a result of a hearing on October 20, 1994, the evidence room was established as of December 1, 1994, in which the government was directed to make all discovery available to the defendants. Numerous discovery disputes arose; the court conducted in camera inspections of documents which the government sought to have excluded, and another discovery hearing was held on April 19, 1995. Defendant Derrick then filed on that date his separate motion to dismiss. On August 25, 1995, Taylor filed his Second Supplemental Memorandum in which he detailed various other allegations of government misconduct he claims came to light only as a result of the additional discovery at his disposal. Derrick also filed a supplement to his motion on September 5, 1995. On September 25, 1995, the government responded to Taylor's August (Second Supplemental) memorandum. It summarizes Taylor's arguments for dismissal as (1) nondisclosure of Brady material, (2) misstatements to the court regarding the existence of discovery material, and (3) the knowing presentation of false testimony. It incorporates its earlier response that under either an outrageous' conduct theory or the Court's supervisory power, a motion to dismiss requires the defendant to prove both intentional governmental misconduct and demonstrable prejudice. [Footnote omitted]. Again, the government summarizes the defendants' contentions into three subject areas: (1) Taylor's response to the government's memorandum 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 7 \f U.S. v. Taylor, 956 F.Supp. 622 (1997) in opposition to the motions to dismiss; (2) the discovery produced since December 1, 1994, and (3) the capital gains tax matter. The government argues specifically with regard to defendant Taylor that, although he now has many more items of discovery which he did not have at his first trial, this is due in large part to the fact that he now has all of the Lost Trust discovery, whether it relates specifically to him or not. The government again argues that the remedy for a significant Brady violation is a new trial, not dismissal *631 of an indictment. As to Taylor's allegations of misstatements by the government to the court or the knowing use of false testimony, the government contends that defendant has completely failed to show bad faith on the part of the government and has not even begun to refute the conclusions of the Offices of Professional Responsibility ... for the Department of Justice ... and the FBI which failed to find merit in [his] allegations. The government also puts forth the argument here that defendant Taylor lacks standing to challenge the alleged misconduct in trials of other Lost Trust defendants and there is no longstanding pattern of government misconduct. In this memorandum the government also refutes Taylor's allegations as to various items of evidence he claims were withheld. These items will be dealt with with specificity later in this order. In its response to defendant Derrick's motion, the government also contends that this defendant has failed to show any intentional misconduct or a longstanding pattern of misconduct or any prejudice which would warrant dismissal of the indictment against him, and that any remedy to which he is entitled has been granted in his impending retrial. After Taylor filed his Second Supplemental Memorandum in August 1995, this court, in October 1995, held a three- day hearing, which resulted in a second extensive in camera inspection and orders filed February 6 and February 23, 1996. The oral arguments by defendants in October 1995 were sufficient to convince the court that the volumes of material that continued to surface and their possible significance to the defendants warranted the issuance of an order directing the government to grant access to the defendants to many documents previously denied to the defendants by the court. Upon review of these documents, Taylor filed his Third Supplemental Memorandum on March 28, 1996, to which the government responded on April 16, 1996. In its opposition, the government refers to its previous opposition briefs to show that Taylor has failed to carry his burden of proving any intentional government misconduct, let alone a longstanding pattern of misconduct.... Nor has the defendant demonstrated any prejudice to his rights that would affect the outcome of his retrial before this Court. Defendant's Memorandum merely cobbles together a voluminous stew of quotations from the government's administrative files together with unwarranted speculation and erroneous legal conclusions, all to support his theory that this Court should take the drastic and disfavored step of dismissing an indictment. [United States' Opposition to Def. Taylor's Third Supp. Memo, 4/16/96, p. 1]. The government further responded to Taylor's argument that the new materials prove that throughout this sting operation the government violated its own representations, the instructions it was required to follow, and the rules designed to insure fairness by affirmatively stating that the government did not violate its internal policies and by citing to a disclaimer in the privately-published DOJ Manual to which the defendant's memorandum referred. It defends its use of the pari-mutuel betting bill for its sting operation and its payments to its primary witness, Ronald L. Cobb. As to defendant's charge of perjury by Cobb and SA Clemens, as well as false statements and arguments by government attorneys, the government argues that no document in the government's files, no document quoted by the defendants, and none of the recently disclosed materials prove that Cobb testified falsely, but only that the government agents and prosecutors did not agree with certain of his interpretations. In addition, as to the third general charge by defendants of willful Brady violations, the government again denies that any documents were willfully withheld or that the defendants are in any way prejudiced since the remedy of retrial is available. 18 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 8 \f U.S. v. Taylor, 956 F.Supp. 622 (1997) *632 In its Post Hearing Memorandum in Opposition to Defendants' Motions to Dismiss, filed October 18, 1996, the government, in addition to its legal arguments as to the defendants' burden of proof, sets out the general denial that there was no intentional effort by the government to withhold discovery; that the discovery errors were, at most, inadvertent and immaterial, and that the government did not intentionally mislead the court about discoverable materials. This memorandum also addresses the defendants' claims of government-sanctioned perjury by Cobb and misconduct in the investigation of the capital gains tax matter. It also touches on several other defense allegations as will be more fully shown hereafter. IV. THE OPEN FILE POLICY From the outset, these cases were to be tried under what is referred to in this district as an open file policy. During its tenure on the bench, this court has conducted numerous criminal trials under this policy and never before has its interpretation been so challenged as in the government's present arguments. As a lawyer and a judge, this court's experience has been that open file meant that the government's entire discovery file would be made available to the defendants for their examination. There are, of course, certain documents excluded from this policy under the government's internal administrative and work product privilege. It has long been established that when an open file policy is declared, the dictates of Brady and Giglio as well as Bills of Particular, become extraneous; all discovery material, except as limited to privileged work product, is made available to the defendants. This would have come as no surprise to USA Daniel or his assistants, most of whom had prosecuted cases before this court on numerous occasions. As shown above, motions to dismiss for prosecutorial misconduct had been filed by one or another of these defendants during the preparation and pendency of their original trials in 1990 and 1991. 19 One of the primary grounds on which those motions and the more recent motions are based is the willful withholding of Brady and other exculpatory material. The defendants have persisted in their allegations that the government had to be withholding evidence critical to their defense and specifically requested some of this evidence in their discovery motions. Where it felt appropriate, the court instructed the government to turn over requested materials, if they existed, to the defendant. But the government would respond by either declaring that disclosure or unredacting of the requested documents would jeopardize ongoing investigations or by affirmatively asserting, without any qualification, that it had complied with its discovery obligations. The existence of several specific documents sought by the defendants was denied in open court by the prosecutors and by SA Clemens under oath. V. DISCUSSION OF THE ISSUES The instant cases first came before the court over six years ago with the indictment of Taylor in August 1990. The evidence as it relates to the retrials of these defendants is in and of itself voluminous. Together with the additional materials that relate to the charges of prosecutorial misconduct, the record now before the court is so vast as to make it virtually impossible to cite to all of the allegations and counter-arguments in detail. The strongest arguments the defendants make as to the significance of the withholding of Brady materials and other exculpatory evidence are found in the arguments relating to several of the issues to be addressed by the court at this time. In addition, defendants' allegations of perjury by certain witnesses and the government's knowledge thereof, as well as alleged misrepresentations to the defendants, the Grand Jury and the court, rising to the level of fraud upon the court, as revealed by the post-remand disclosure of evidence, must also be addressed. 1. The Withholding of Evidence as to Cobb's Characterization of the Payments Made to Legislators. Cobb consistently testified that he considered the monies he gave four of these defendants *633 to be bribes. 20 These defendants have consistently argued that the monies they received were considered by them to be campaign contributions and contend that certain withheld 302s would have served to impeach Cobb's bribery testimony. On June 14, 1989, an FD 302 of a Cobb debriefing was prepared by SA Clemens. This 302, which was not turned over to the defendants until November 29, 1993, states on page 2: 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 9 \f U.S. v. Taylor, 956 F.Supp. 622 (1997) COBB related that in regards to giving money to State Legislators, he routinely gives two or three hundred dollars to some just to keep them friendly toward him.... COBB stated that TEE FERGUSON, CHARLES A. HARVIN, III and DONNA MOSS were among those who he would give money. COBB indicated this money was not paid for any specific return benefit other than having someone friendly to him on whom he could call. [Taylor's Supp.Memo, 2/10/94, Exh. 4, p. 2]. Again, on June 22, 1989, Clemens prepared another Cobb FD 302, which did not surface until the Derrick trial. This 302 states in pertinent part: RONALD L. COBB provided a 1989 South Carolina Legislative Manual in which he had checked off all those legislators to whom he had paid money. When asked if these were bribe type payments or campaign contributions COBB replied, That's a hard question to answer. COBB was then asked if those checked off were persons he had given two, three, or four hundred dollars to for no specific reason other than to maintain favorable contact with COBB. COBB indicated that this was the case, and indicated he would give the money to the legislator and that was it. If the individual then wanted to claim it as a campaign contribution and report it or just stick it in his pocket, that was of no concern to COBB. [Emphasis added]. [Taylor's Supp.Memo 2/10/94, Exh. 1] The names of each of the within defendants are shown as checked off in the Legislative Manual; however, the listing of names with check marks next to them includes the names of numerous other legislators who were never targeted or indicted by the government in the Lost Trust investigation. 21 On July 26, 1989, another Cobb FD 302 was prepared by Clemens and was only turned over to the defendants after the issuance of this court's November 8, 1994, order. The following information is contained therein: COBB was asked about the manner in which he would pay legislators several hundred dollars. COBB stated that this was sometimes accomplished with cash, and sometimes by check, either from his business or personal account. COBB advised that sometimes payments were made at official fund raisers and sometimes in a social setting as a token of appreciation for support on something. COBB stated that sometimes a legislator will drop a hint that money is tight and that they could use some cash. COBB *634 added that if it was someone who was friendly toward his interests he would take care of them with a few hundred dollars. COBB emphasized that he did not know and did not care how they handled or reported the money. COBB's sole interest was to gain friends and supporters of his interests. [Hearing, 10/18 20/95, Taylor Exh. 3]. This language from these three FD 302s is used by the FBI Columbia Office almost verbatim in its Undercover Operation Proposal (UCO) dated September 5, 1989 [Taylor's Third Supp. Memo, 3/28/96, Exh. 1, p. 13], seeking authorization for this undercover operation. The government, therefore, was totally familiar with the existence of these 302s, yet it did not turn them over to the defendants for use at trial. Reference in the above-quoted FD 302 of July 26, 1989, to payments being made to legislators sometimes by check, either from his business or personal account, prompted requests from the defendants for Cobb's financial records. At the final hearing on the instant motions on October 3, 1996, testimony was elicited on direct examination of Mrs. Rhonda Collins 22 that the defendants were furnished with the records of Cobb's business account Government Business Associates, Inc. in or about May 1995. She stated that copies of nine (9) checks payable to various legislators in amounts between $100 and $650 23 have been found in these records. Mrs. Collins further stated that the defendants had never been furnished copies of Cobb's personal financial records. The defendants argue that the nine checks in increments of $100 to $650 corroborate the information quoted above from the FD 302s of June 14, 1989, June 22, 1989, and July 26, 1989, and that this information would have served to refute Cobb's testimony at the trials that the payments he made to these defendants were definitely known by them to be bribes. [See Hearing Tr., 10/18 20/95, pp. 56 66]. In its Post Remand Memorandum, the government argues that the financial records of Government Business Associates 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 10 \f U.S. v. Taylor, 956 F.Supp. 622 (1997) were submitted to the court for in camera inspection and that the court's order of July 25, 1995, held that the government need not provide these records to the defendants, but that upon resubmission the court ordered that the records be provided to the defendants on September 7, 1995. It is the government's contention that this reflects the less than clear nature of the discoverability of certain documents in this matter, especially these checks. A reading of this court's September 7th order, however, simply shows an admission by the court that it did not properly identify the photostatic copies of bank statements and canceled checks on this account in the first in camera submission of eleven file boxes of material under review. More importantly, however, the question is not why these records were not furnished in 1994 or 1995, but why they were not furnished to the defendants prior to their initial trials in 1990 and 1991. In addition to the above, defendants cite to the withholding of 302s on James Faber, Frank Earl McBride, and Ennis Maurice Fant, all dated July 18, 1990, in which each of them stated they believed the monies they received from Cobb to be campaign contributions. [Taylor's Motion to Dismiss, 9/23/93, Exhs. 13 15]. These 302s were derived from interviews conducted by the FBI simultaneously with the FBI's initial interview of defendant Taylor. 24 All four of these defendants *635 (Taylor, Faber, McBride and Fant), as well as others, were approached in a sweep by the FBI of targets of the Lost Trust investigation and must have been considered all part of the same case. Even had the defendants not been able to utilize these 302s at trial as statements of unavailable witnesses, as argued by the government in its Post Hearing Memorandum, it is the opinion of the court that these 302s should have been provided as relevant discovery material. Cobb testified that after he had been set up by the FBI as a lobbyist for the bogus Alpha Group in order to catch legislators accepting bribes for their support of the pari- mutuel bill, he sought the help of defendant Taylor in recruiting black legislators and the help of Kohn in recruiting white legislators. Taylor argues in his memorandum of February 10, 1994, that taped conversations between Cobb and Kohn go to the vital issue of whether or not the government was running a sting to catch crooked legislators or whether, on the other hand, Cobb was trying to make it appear that he could buy votes from legislators other than Senator Lindsay in an effort to save himself from the consequences of numerous illegal acts for which he could be prosecuted. [Taylor's Supp. Memo, 2/10/94, p. 9]. Taylor was a co-sponsor of the pending pari-mutuel bill and sat on both the Labor, Commerce & Industry Committee of the House of Representatives and the Banking and Consumer Affairs Sub Committee. Prior to the institution of the sting operation, the pari-mutuel bill had successfully passed these committees. Taylor contends that his continued support of the bill was not an explicit quid pro quo. He argues that this is corroborated on a tape recorded conversation of January 16, 1990 (Tape # 14), on which Kohn is heard to remark: ... we got the thing out of committee with no one doing anything..... No money, and you know, just, just doin' for the issue. [Taylor's Supp. Memo, 2/10/94, Exh. 9, p. 2]. Taylor further argues that this same tape shows that, in spite of FBI instructions to Cobb to be explicit about the quid pro quo aspect of his payments to legislators, Cobb felt the need to be far more subtle in his approach. In encouraging Kohn to bring supporters to him, Cobb instructed Kohn: You know how to, I mean you know how to work it and cover us, I mean, we don't want come over there and say well, here, they're gonna buy the damn thing. [Id. at p. 4] On an audio tape of April 5, 1990 (Tape # 75), Kohn tells Cobb: (UI)I'm not trying to hold back, I mean I realize (UI) I ain't trying to play that game. (UI)I've been asked for gold coins. If it doesn't look like money should be brought up, I don't do it to hold back money, I just don't think it's good to bring it up (UI). I use (UI) some of them I just casual comment about a contribution to their campaign cause see if you have to do that I can write a check and tell them I think their [sic] a good spirited citizen (UI). 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 11 \f U.S. v. Taylor, 956 F.Supp. 622 (1997) [Id., Exh. 12, p. 13]. The transcript of this tape is made a part of an FD 302, which states that this audiotape is of a telephone conversation Cobb has with a Wade Ronnie Crow, 25 followed by a meeting with Faber, McBride, Kohn, Taylor and one Rachel Harper. Taylor is shown to speak only once, and it is impossible for the court to ascertain whether he was present at the time the above statement was made by Kohn. His name, however, does appear in the cover *636 FD 302, yet he was not furnished this tape or the FD 302 and transcription prior to his trial. These tapes, as well as the numerous other audio and video tapes furnished to the defendants on November 29, 1993, certainly must be viewed as exculpatory evidence which could have been used to further the defense put forth by these defendants that they considered the monies they received from Cobb to be campaign contributions. In this order the court cites allegations primarily from the arguments, memorandums and exhibits of defendants Taylor, Blanding and Gordon. In fact, with regard to the timing of their trials and evidence not furnished to them for their defenses, their positions are closely related. Derrick was the defendant in the third Lost Trust trial, and some, although by no means all, of the previously withheld evidence was available to him and defendant Long for their trials. 26 Defendant Derrick also presented additional testimony at his trial that the monies he received from Cobb were used to produce a semi-annual newsletter to his constituents. The government objected to the admission into evidence of a copy of the newsletter he had published in the spring prior to his indictment on the grounds that it had never received a copy of that newsletter, that it was hearsay, and that it was irrelevant. Paul Derrick affirmatively stated at trial that he had given a copy to the government. At a hearing on April 19, 1995, Derrick disclosed that we have just recently discovered in the most recent documents an FBI 302. Guess what is attached to it? That news letter. They had it.... We didn't get to get that in during the trial. [Hearing Tr., 4/19/95, p. 37]. Defendant Long is presently before this court for a new trial granted him by this court, which decision was upheld on appeal. At the conclusion of the Long trial, this court dismissed one count against Long; however, tapes ruled pertinent only to the dismissed count inadvertently had been allowed to go to the jury room. Long, however, has joined in the motions for dismissal on the grounds of prosecutorial misconduct as the motions may relate to him. 27 At the motions' hearing in October 1995, Long cross- examined Cobb concerning his testimony at Long's trial that when Cobb gave Long the money in question in this case, Long had no idea that it was a bribe. The transcript from October 19, 1995, reads: Q. That he would have thought that you were simply helping him out of his financial difficulties, and it was not related to any legislation pending in the South Carolina Legislature; is that correct? A. That's correct, yes, sir. Q. Specifically the pari-mutuel bill? A. Yes, sir. Q. And the pari-mutuel bill, as a matter of fact, was something that Bud Long had always supported; is that correct? A. Yes, sir. Q. As I understand it, it is your position that Bud Long never had the intent to accept a bribe? A. That's correct. Q. And that you led him to believe, or did not lead him to believe other than it was just some money from a friend to help him out of his financial difficulties? A. He was in a tight, [sic] and he had been very valuable in assisting me in getting clients, and I had given Bud money from time to time, and he could very easily have thought that this was one of those situations. As a matter of fact, I think he even told me to make sure I think he may have looked at it as a contribution, because he told me one time to make sure that I thank my people for the contribution. *637 .... 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 12 \f U.S. v. Taylor, 956 F.Supp. 622 (1997) Q. Now, let me ask you this, which I was not able to ask at the trial, because I did not know about that until the trial, prior to the meeting ever being arranged or your discussion with Bud Long concerning this money, did you communicate to the F.B.I. that it was unfair to put Bud Long in that position, because of, number one, his financial difficulties; and, number two, because of your unique relationship with him, he would not understand and not realize it was a bribe? A. Yes, sir, I did; also, to the U.S. Attorney's Office. Q. This is prior to it ever coming about? A. That's correct. [Hearing Tr., 10/19/95, Vol. II, pp. 32 3]. Cobb further testified that in the time frame prior to the exchange of money with Long, he voiced the same concern to AUSA Alfred W. (Buddy) Bethea, SA Clemens, USA Daniel, and AUSA Barton; but, in spite of his protestations on more than one occasion, SA Clemens instructed him to go ahead and meet with Long. [Id. at p. 34]. He further testified that he repeatedly told AUSA Bethea, who was to be the lead prosecutor for the Long trial, that Long would have had no reason to believe that the money he was accepting from Cobb was bribe money. When asked for AUSA Bethea's reaction, he stated: His reaction was one of he had made up his mind that Bud Long was guilty, he wanted to try him, he hadn't participated in any of the trials, and he was more gung ho, I think, about trying the case than anything else. We had a very strong disagreement in this regard. [Id. at pp. 40 1]. When Cobb testified to the above on direct examination by AUSA John W. McIntosh at Long's trial, McIntosh personally refused to proceed with the prosecution; and USA Daniel, who had not been part of the trial prosecution team, replaced him for the balance of the trial. 2. The Capital Gains Tax Investigation and Ronald L. Cobb. Cobb has been previously identified in this order as the government's key confidential informant employed in the sting operation. Cobb was a former member of the South Carolina State Legislature and a licensed lobbyist. He maintained throughout these cases that he was a close personal friend of Lindsay, who was undisputedly one of the most powerful men in State government. Lindsay was a member of the Senate Conference Committee appointed to negotiate the differences between the Senate and House versions of the 1988 Appropriations Bill, in which a capital gains tax rollback provision had been included as a proviso. Prior to his trial, Taylor had received a substantially redacted FD 302 of an interview of lobbyist J. Randal Lee by SA Clemens and SA Thomas J. Davis conducted August 14 21, 1990. [Hearing, 10/18 20/95, Gordon Exh. G]. Taylor argued that he was entitled to place Cobb's credibility before the jury and that to do so he would need to review documents he believed to be in the government's possession, and to be furnished the identity, which had been redacted from the documents furnished, of various elected officials to whom Cobb had made payoffs. A transcript of a pre-trial motions hearing on October 11, 1990, reveals Taylor's argument that nothing is more relevant to this whole case than the credibility of Mr. Ron Cobb. [Hearing Tr., 10/11/90, pp. 37 42]. Apparently, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals agrees. 28 Some six days prior to the Blanding/Gordon trial, the government turned over to those defendants the unredacted FD 302 dated August 14 21, 1990 [Taylor's Supp.Memo, 2/10/94, Exh. 7], which disclosed that Lindsay's name had been redacted in the version furnished Taylor. This 302 discusses *638 at length the South Carolina Capital Gains Tax bill initiated in 1988 (the proviso ), and puts the government on notice of alleged bribe payment arrangements involving Richard E. Greer, Chairman of the South Carolina State Development Board, Lindsay, Cobb, and various other persons. Also during the Blanding/Gordon trial, on February 22, 1991, as the result of a court order of February 14, 1991, the government furnished the Blanding/Gordon defendants with 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 13 \f U.S. v. Taylor, 956 F.Supp. 622 (1997) an unredacted FD 302 of an interview of Cobb by FBI SA Arthur Richards dated May 1, 1989, which revealed Lindsay's involvement in payoffs regarding legislation known as the Oil Jobbers bill. At a hearing on Blanding and Gordon's motions to dismiss for prosecutorial misconduct filed on February 25, 1991, and heard February 28, 1991, Richards confirmed under oath Cobb's understanding that the debriefing on May 1, 1989, concerned payoffs and kickbacks and extortion. We were talking about payoffs. [Gordon's Motion to Dismiss, 2/22/93, Exh. C, p. 120]. Richards testified that he debriefed Cobb prior to and after he administered a polygraph examination. On direct examination by Gordon, Richards related that Cobb initially failed the polygraph test he was administering to him concerning the Oil Jobbers bill, testifying as follows: A. .... He [Cobb] said that through an intermediary, that he initially would not identify, he paid Representative Mangum [sic] 29 $10,000 in order to get his vote. That was the first issue that I polygraphed. Q. Okay. Now the issue that you polygraphed him on was whether or not he in fact paid representative Mangum the $10,000 through the intermediary. A. That's correct. Q. All right, sir. And he tested truthful on that? A. He did not. He failed that polygraph examination. Q. What happened after that? A. Then after he failed it, he was confronted with the fact that he had failed it. And he said that he had that there was another person involved, this intermediary, and that that intermediary also got some money. But he would not at that point, without certain assurances, would not disclose the identity of the intermediary. .... Q. And because he hadn't divulged to you that there was another party involved, Senator Lindsay A. Exactly. Q. he showed deception? A. He showed deception. At that point, I put him on the telephone with Agent Clemens, and together they worked out an arrangement where the government, if he gave us the identity of the intermediary, where the government would not use his statement against that intermediary,.... .... A. Okay. After it was worked out and it was agreeable to Agent Clemens and agreeable to Mr. Cobb, at that point he wrote down Jack Lindsay on a sheet of paper. I'm talking about Mr. Cobb showed it to me, and then crumpled the piece of paper up and threw it in the trash can. .... Q. And when you tested him about the payoff to Representative Mangum, after he divulged to you that Senator Lindsay was the intermediary, how did Mr. Cobb do? A. He passed the second test. [Id. at pp. 111 19]. This testimony alone refutes the government's argument that Cobb has consistently adhered to his subjective view of the facts during the investigation ... [Gov's Post Hearing Memo, 10/18/96, p. 23], and that the defendants do not and cannot show perjury by Cobb as to his subjective beliefs, ... [Id. at p. 26]. At this same hearing on February 28, 1991, Gordon furthered the argument that, if the government had any 302 regarding Cobb's payoffs to Lindsay, the defendants were entitled to know if they have talked to *639 Mr. Cobb and he's indicated these illegal payoffs. To this, the government replied: ... if he's looking for the secret 302 of Ron Cobb where this is discussed, it does not exist. There is no such 302 concerning that.... But there are no 302's or statements from Cobb concerning this particular instance involving capital gains tax. [Id. at p. 11 2]. At this hearing, SA Clemens was also examined under oath by Gordon as to the existence of any FD 302s Clemens might have prepared concerning Cobb's involvement with capital gains. The record reads as follows: 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 14 \f U.S. v. Taylor, 956 F.Supp. 622 (1997) Q. Mr. Clemens, I know you said you only briefly discussed it, but apparently y'all had some discussion about Ron Cobb's involvement with the capital gains tax legislation. Did you do a 302 or anything concerning that debriefing of Mr. Cobb? A. No. Q. Do you have any rough notes of it? A. No.... [Id., Exh. D, p. 36 7]. Mr. Barton concluded on this subject with the statement: There are three 302's and two volumes of Grand Jury testimony, that is the only thing that the government has from Mr. Cobb. [Id., Exh. C, p. 18]. As mentioned elsewhere in this order, copies of checks from Cobb's business account payable to Lindsay were also in possession of the government, but they were not furnished to the defendants at that time. Although Cobb testified that he sometimes wrote checks to legislators from his personal account, there is no evidence the government ever sought to obtain these records. On November 29, 1993, following remand of these cases for retrial, the government furnished for the first time an FD 302 of an interview of Cobb by SA Clemens dated September 25, 1989, in which the payments to Lindsay by Cobb with regard to the capital gains tax bill were characterized as payoffs. This is the secret FD 302 that's existence was previously denied by the government. This 302 was found by defendants in the November 29, 1993, discovery in a file marked KOHN 1 and is one of the two undisclosed 302s on which the Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) Report focused. The defendants take the position that SA Clemens' testimony that he had never prepared such a 302 was perjury and that the prosecutors were fully aware of the existence of that 302 and allowed the testimony to stand. SA Clemens explained to OPR investigators that he forgot it ever existed , calling it a garbage 302, [Hearing, 4/19/95, Defs. Exh. 45, pp. 32 3] and the government argues that this testimony should be excused inasmuch as this was Mr. Clemens' first time to testify at a trial. This is refuted by the defendants' argument that every witness is expected to tell the truth, regardless of whether or not it is their first time to testify. 30 During the OPR investigation, it was disclosed that rough notes of the interview which led to the 302 of September 25, 1989, had been taken by SA Clemens to his home in the Washington, D.C., area when he was promoted and transferred to FBI Headquarters from Columbia, S.C. 31 These notes were eventually provided by Clemens to the OPR in 1994 during its investigation. For this and several other infractions of FBI regulations, SA Clemens received a letter of censure, a five-calendar-day suspension, and six months' probation. At the Taylor trial, Cobb was asked on cross-examination: Mr. Cobb, I want you to tell me right now whether or not you have ever given bribes or illegal money to Senator Lindsay? Answer: No, sir, I have not given Senator Lindsay any bribes or illegal money. [Taylor Trial Tr., Vol. 3, p. 56]. The defendants argue that the government knew at that point in time that Cobb was *640 committing perjury and they allowed this perjurious testimony to stand and to continue throughout the subsequent trials. The government responds that, although it may have believed the payments of monies by Cobb to Lindsay were illegal, that Cobb's testimony could not be considered perjury because Cobb, himself, did not believe the monies to be illegal. The evidence now shows, however, that Cobb not only discussed payoffs in connection with the capital gains tax bill with SA Clemens, with Greer, and in the presence of Randy Lee, all of whom knew that the Cobb payments to Lindsay were, in fact, illegal, but he admitted to SA Richards on May 1, 1989, that he paid $20,000 in illegal monies to Lindsay and Magnum for their influence in passing the oil jobbers bill. Also in the record is a sworn Affidavit from SA Ronald L. Dick, who acted as the supervising agent at FBI Columbia for much of this investigation, which affirms defendants allegations that the government was totally aware of the nature of the Cobb payments to Lindsay. In his Affidavit, Dick states: 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 15 \f U.S. v. Taylor, 956 F.Supp. 622 (1997) I recall the subject of the capital gains tax bill. My recollection is that there were other cooperating witnesses who were providing information regarding this issue. However, Cobb would never allow the payments Cobb made to state senator Jack Lindsay to be characterized as bribes. My position on this matter was similar to the old saying that if it walks like a duck, talks like a duck, and looks like a duck, then it must be a duck. After listening to Cobb try to characterize the payments made to Lindsay as anything other than bribery, I remain unconvinced. As an FBI agent, it was clear to me that the monies paid to Lindsay by Cobb were in violation of the Hobbs Act. Cobb, however, would never allow these transactions to be characterized as bribes. This was the subject of much discussion between SSA Clemens, myself and the USAO Office. [Dick Affidavit to DOJ/OPR, 7/12/94]. A review of the UCO for the Lost Trust sting operation, then code-named Phaedrus, prepared by FBI Columbia in September 1989 [Taylor's Third Supp.Memo, 3/28/96, Exh. 1, p. 10], reflects that almost the identical wording was used in the UCO as that in SA Richards' FD 302 of May 1, 1989. [Hearing, 10/18 20/95, Taylor Exh. 2]. The names of both then-Supervising Agent in Charge James F. Denton, III, and SA Clemens appear on the Airtel which transmitted the UCO to FBI Headquarters. The government maintains that it was absolutely necessary to redact Lindsay's name from both SA Richard's FD 302 of May 1, 1989, and from Randy Lee's FD 302 of August 14 21, 1990, to protect an on-going investigation. However, it is difficult to reconcile this reasoning with SA Clemens' interpretation that Cobb's reference to pay- offs to Lindsay were part of a garbage 302 or with the testimony of SA Dick. Furthermore, the FBI relied in part on this information for authority to instigate the entire sting operation. The court simply cannot disregard Lindsay's prominent position in the politics of South Carolina and the obvious importance to both the FBI and the AUSO of information that he was involved in corruption. The explosive nature of that information, as well as information that Rogers, the Speaker of the House, and Greer, the Chairman of the State Development Board and, undisputedly, a close friend of Governor Carroll A. Campbell, Jr., were also involved, is revealed in an August 28, 1990, teletype sent from FBI Columbia to FBI Headquarters which requested authority for lobbyist Randy Lee to utilize electronic recording devices to monitor anticipated conversations with Greer. Greer, Lindsay and Rogers are the captioned subjects. That teletype reads in part: This request will require DOJ authority as sensitive circumstances exist in that captioned subjects are members of the South Carolina Legislature and high ranking State government employees. Three CWs hereafter referred to as CW 1 [Lobbyist Lee], CW 2 [Senator Lee] and CW 3 [Cobb] have provided information that bribe payments were made to South Carolina State Representatives John Irby Rogers, III, and South Carolina State Senator *641 John Charles Lindsay, in order to ensure the passage of certain capital gains tax legislation in the State of S.C. during the 1988 1989 legislative session. .... AUSA John Barton is aware of the facts of this case and fully concurs with the use of consensual monitoring. Entrapment is not an issue based upon the facts obtained thusfar [sic]. [Hearing, 10/18 20/95, Gordon Exh. T]. These were big fish, yet on February 28, 1990, Clemens testified concerning debriefings of Cobb about the capital gains tax matter that he had only talked to him for a short period of time to get a general general idea of what had gone on. [Gordon's Motion to Dismiss, 2/22/90, Exh. D, p. 37]. AUSA Barton was handling the discovery for the Taylor trial, and any 302 mentioning any one of these three subjects would certainly have been noticed by him, yet he denied the existence of the secret 302. At the Taylor pretrial hearing on October 11, 1990, and, in fact, at the subsequent hearings and trials in the entire Lost 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 16 \f U.S. v. Taylor, 956 F.Supp. 622 (1997) Trust matter, the court relied on the repeated representations by the government as officers of the court, that all the discovery to which the defendants were entitled had been turned over to them. The court is shown to have advised Taylor at his pretrial hearing: Well, based on what Mr. DuTremble tells the court, you know, I don't know that they have anything else to give you, sir. [Taylor Trial Tr., p. 54]. The court then stated: them answers [the United States ... when he [Brady Attorney] motion requests], and he's an attorney, signs his name down there, you know, just because he is a United States attorney, doesn't stop him from being an attorney, then I accept that just like I do any other attorney's signature. And they know what the ramifications are if they don't done in accordance . [Id. at p. 59] Just prior to Cobb's testimony at the Taylor trial, Taylor received a copy of Cobb's agreement with the FBI, the USAO, and the Office of the Attorney General of South Carolina. Taylor renewed his Brady motion that he be provided the actual details of all the crimes for which Mr. Cobb had been immunized under this agreement. The court, assuming that the government had disclosed all it had a duty to disclose, addressed Taylor's counsel as follows: ... you know as much about the government's case as the government knows. Supposedly they have given you everything they have short of which they have not told you which witnesses they are going to call and what have you. Other than that, you have everything they have. I just don't know what it is you think I can do about it. [Id. at p. 9]. Taylor, at this point in time, however, had none of the government's evidence of Cobb's pay-offs to Lindsay. At the February 28, 1991, hearing, after AUSA Barton's denial of the existence of the secret 302, the court admonished: ... all I can do is take them at their word, because they have always performed like most officers of the court do.... And Mr. Barton just said there are no 302's dealing with these matters which you talk about. And we are all aware that there are all kinds of ongoing investigations, and I'm sure if they already had them, he would have them and he would at least tell me that he had them and give them to me to look at and see if I thought he ought to have to give them to you. [Gordon's Motion to Dismiss, 2/22/93, p. 14]. Later in that same hearing, the court stated: I have already told them to give you everything they have, and I don't know how I can do better than that. Now, if you find out they didn't give you what they had, then I will take appropriate steps there. .... Mr. Barton has been trying to tell us from the time we got started, kept standing up and I kept sitting him down, and then I was confident he was going to say, We have given them everything we have, and *642 that is what he eventually said. [Emphasis added]. [Id. at p. 17]. Although the record will reflect that other questionable government conduct surfaced with regard to the handling of the Lindsay matter, the government's problems with Lindsay's involvement were mooted by his death. Rogers eventually pled. The record as to Greer, however, must be addressed. 3. The Capital Gains Tax Investigation and Richard E. Greer. Greer was initially implicated in the Lost Trust investigation by the August 1989 FD 302 of lobbyist Randy Lee. Lee's FD 302, which resulted from interviews conducted by the FBI on August 14 through 21, 1990, reads in pertinent part as follows: 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 17 \f U.S. v. Taylor, 956 F.Supp. 622 (1997) LEE stated he recalled GREER saying It is very big, it is important to a lot of people it would help a lot of the Governor's friends. Lee stated that as the conversation continued, it became obvious to him that GREER had arranged for several wealthy individuals, who were staunch supporters of Governor CARROLL CAMPBELL, to invest a large amount of money to affect the rollback. LEE stated the money to be invested by several of the participants, arranged by GREER, would be paid as a bribe to insure that the rollback would take place.... LEE stated he learned that ROE, BRASIER and possibly a third party, had been quoted a fee of seventy-five thousand dollars each, by GREER. LEE stated he either heard GREER mention this amount during the initial conversation, or at a later date; however, it was later explained to him by COBB. LEE stated he has never been certain whether or not the third unidentified individual was to pay a particular sum of money; however, he was certain that GREER had arranged for COBB and Senator JACK LINDSEY [sic] to receive one hundred fifty thousand dollars from ROE and BRASIER in the event they were able to affect the rollback of the Legislation, which was disguised as a proviso within the Appropriations Bill. [Taylor's Supp.Memo, 2/10/94, Exh. 7]. It is undisputed that USA Daniel and possibly SA Clemens, met with Greer and his attorney in Charleston, S.C., sometime in December of 1990. The defendants made repeated inquiries concerning the existence of a 302 or rough notes of this meeting. In its memorandum of October 18, 1996, the government reiterates that no such 302 exists and contends that the circumstances of that meeting suggest that no 302 would have been done. [Gov's. Post Hearing Memo, 10/18/96, p. 35]. What the memorandum does not address, however, is Greer's testimony that he was interviewed numerous or, at least, several times [Hearing Tr., 10/20/95, Vol. III, p. 342]. Although his testimony of the precise number of interviews, the time frame of each, and the place of each interview was never made completely clear, Greer stated that on at least two occasions subsequent to the initial meeting he was interrogated extensively by the FBI for several hours. Id. at pp. 362 6. A 302 of one interview with Greer in April 1991 dealing exclusively with his drug usage was furnished the defendants in discovery. If Greer testified truthfully that at one or more of these interviews he discussed the capital gains tax issue and his willingness to testify against Lindsay, then it would appear to the court that at least one 302 should have been prepared in connection with capital gains. Greer pled guilty to a drug charge and was sentenced by this court in July of 1991. At his sentencing hearing, the government argued for a downward departure from Greer's sentencing guidelines; and SA Davis, in the presence of USA Daniel and AUSA Barton, stated to the court: Your Honor, last Christmas, the FBI approached Dick Greer for the first time in connection with our drug investigation of Mr. Greer. This was prior to the Jack Rogers indictment. At that time Mr. Greer provided us with information concerning the capital gains tax investigation. Mr. Greer essentially told us that Lobbyist Ron Cobb had approached him and told him that he needed more money to pay off *643 both Jack Rogers and Senator Jack Lindsay in connection with the capital gains tax bill. He told us this is the first time that he knew that Ron Cobb that what he was doing was illegal. Mr. Greer was willing to testify against Mr. Rogers should he have been brought to trial and was in fact scheduled to testify against Mr. Rogers. Also Mr. Greer was willing and scheduled to testify against Senator Jack Lindsay in connection with this investigation. I think the investigation certainly would have resulted in an indictment should Mr. Lindsay have lived. [Hearing, 10/18 20/95, Gordon Exh. M, p. 13]. AUSA Barton informed the court at that same hearing: ... we were able to bring the people in there and determine that other than Ron Cobb, Jack Lindsay and Jack Rogers, there was no illegality with any piece of capital gains legislation. That illegality was only applicable to the retroactive affect of capital gains and had nothing to do with what the governor's number one priority of the Legislature was, changing the perspective (sic) capital gains rate. We find other than, as I described to you, Cobb, Lindsay and Rogers, we find no corruption, no undue improper 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 18 \f U.S. v. Taylor, 956 F.Supp. 622 (1997) influence, no money changing hands with regard to any of the capital gains bills. [Id. at p. 11]. During the arguments for a downward departure for Greer, it became apparent that this court was poised to deny the motion, and AUSA Barton requested an in camera hearing to furnish the court with additional information. It was at this in camera proceeding that USA Daniel and AUSA Barton presented, in some 16 pages of transcript [Id., Exh. L, pp. 34 49], the argument to the court that Greer had been of invaluable assistance to the government in explaining that two capital gains tax bills were before the Legislature, a retrospective or rollback capital gains tax bill and a prospective capital gains tax bill; that Greer had clarified the difference between the two, and that it was the passage of the prospective bill in which the Governor and his staff were actively engaged. USA Daniel and AUSA Barton informed the court that the information given the government by Randy Lee had been misleading and that it was Greer who was able to put the government investigation on the proper course that led the government to close its investigation on capital gains. In this regard, it is interesting to note that SA Davis, who, with SA Clemens, was present at the December 1990 meeting, told the OPR investigators that the first time he and Clemens ever heard this explanation of the prospective bill was at the Greer sentencing. Davis and Clemens were the two FBI agents most involved in the Lost Trust investigation. The defendants allege that Greer perjured himself before the Grand Jury and in the presence of USA Daniel. In the interim between the Christmas 1990 meeting with Greer and his sentencing hearing in July 1991, Greer testified on May 23, 1991, before the Grand Jury; and, in response to inquiry from AUSA Barton, he testified: Q. Were you aware of any monies paid to any legislators in [an] effort to influence their vote in connection with the capital gains rollback bill? A. No. Q. How about in connection with the Governor's change, the bill that was his priority? A. Absolutely not. [Id., Exh. K, pp. 14 5]. It is obvious from the government's argument for a downward departure for Greer that Greer had knowledge as early as December of 1990 that payoffs had been made by Cobb to Lindsay and Rogers. USA Daniel, who was present at the Christmas 1990 meeting, and who was, or should have been, privy to information given at other debriefings of Greer, was also present when AUSA Barton questioned Greer before the Grand Jury. Daniel did nothing to correct Greer's testimony that he was not aware of any illegal payoffs to legislators. AUSA Barton, in his interview with the OPR, provides the speculation as to why Greer responded as he did to the subject question before the Grand Jury. He opines that Greer might have felt justified in a negative response to the wording *644 Were you aware ..., whereas a positive response would have been forthcoming to the question had it been phrased Are you aware.... Greer's later statements in the record would tend to confirm that suggestion. This play with semantics, however, appears to the court to be totally without merit. In spite of the government's reliance at Greer's sentencing on the information given by Greer, no notes or FD 302s or written memorandums of any kind have surfaced of any debriefings of Greer with regard to capital gains. Also, in its in camera argument for Greer's downward departure motion, the government asserts that it was Greer who provided the names of those persons who could testify before the Grand Jury in support of Greer's version of the capital gains tax bills. The government states in its October 18, 1996, memorandum that the evidence showed that the government actively pursued the three identified subjects of that investigation [capital gains]: Dick Greer, Lindsay and Jack Rogers. [Gov.'s Post Hearing Memo, 10/18/96, p. 27]. The court disagrees. Greer, himself, was never polygraphed and no FD 302s or other written memorandums exist. The government further affirmatively states that Greer did not receive money in connection with capital gains legislation. [Id. at p. 28]. There is nothing is the record to show that the government's active pursuit of Greer included a review of Greer's financial records. It appears that the government simply accepted Greer's version of events and characterized the information given by Randy Lee as speculative and misleading. Although at the Greer sentencing hearing it was indicated that the government was misled about the 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 19 \f U.S. v. Taylor, 956 F.Supp. 622 (1997) capital gains matter by this information, Randy Lee was the beneficiary of a downward departure motion by the government at his sentencing hearing on January 13, 1992, based on his substantial assistance to the government. The court has difficulty in reconciling the government's position that Mr. Greer's substantial assistance served to correct its misconception about the capital gains tax bills and allowed it to put the capital gains tax investigation to rest with its position that Randy Lee provided them with substantial assistance, when it now claims Lee misled them into a lengthy and expensive investigation. 32 Further, at the sentencing of Lost Trust defendant Senator William Richard Lee on December 3, 1990, the government requested an in camera hearing for its argument in support of its downward departure motion. At that time, AUSA Barton stated: Your Honor, specifically after Mr. Lee gave us those revelations about the push that was put on we started looking at some of the individuals who we had some suspicion about and specifically I would anticipate the government seeking an indictment against Representative Rogers, probably this month, for the acceptance of money in connection with his vote and work on the capital gains bill. There is substantial information about Senator Lindsay as well and his acceptance of money for his vote and support in connection with the capital gains bill. So based on what Mr. Lee gave us and the sort of a kick-off, if you will, we caught the ball and ran with it and have run into some pretty good areas that will very definitely result in charges brought against I can affirmatively represent to you against Representative Rogers as a result. [Hearing, 10/18 20/95, Gordon Exh. J, p. 4]. Senator Lee informed the court, in camera, through his attorney, that he was present at a meeting of Republican legislators with the Governor and his staff in the spring or early summer of 1988 where he was told to back this bill. It is the most important piece of legislation to the governor's office for this legislative year. If anybody raises a question about it, you are to sweep it under the rug. A list was given to him on *645 how to handle any tricky or difficult questions, a script. [Id. at p. 9] If the reference by the Governor's Office to this most important legislation was a reference to the prospective capital gains tax bill as described by Mr. Greer, and not to the retroactive proviso in the Appropriations Bill, which allegedly would have been extremely beneficial to some of the Governor's friends and contributors, what would have been the need to sweep under the rug any tricky questions. The information provided by Senator Lee is consistent with the FD 302 of Lobbyist Lee wherein he referred to a meeting the Governor had with Republican representatives sometimes after early May 1988 in which an answer sheet was distributed to the attendees. A discussion of the capital gains tax investigation would not be complete without mention of a bizarre incident which came to light during the OPR investigation. Prior to the OPR investigation, the transcripts of four of the five persons who testified before the Grand Jury with regard to capital gains 33 disappeared from a file cabinet at the U.S. Attorney's Office and later appeared, unexplained, in AUSA Barton's desk drawer. This disappearance has never been explained or, to the court's knowledge, ever been fully investigated. 4. Visit by Cobb and SA Clemens to Home of Steven H. Smith and Telephone Call to Lindsay. Subsequent to the drawing of the Blanding/Gordon jury and prior to the commencement of opening statements, early on the morning of February 27, 1991, defendants filed a motion to dismiss for prosecutorial misconduct and requested an in camera hearing out of the presence of the government in order to proffer certain information. The hearing involved the unredacted copy of a 302 by SA Richards on May 1, 1989, only received by defendants Blanding/Gordon on February 22, 1991, which defendants alleged substantiated that Cobb not only committed perjury at the Taylor trial, but that the government was aware that he was testifying falsely. [See also, V 2 of this order]. The motion further involved the defendants allegation that Cobb committed perjury before the Grand Jury with regard to his drug usage, and that 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 20 \f U.S. v. Taylor, 956 F.Supp. 622 (1997) information substantiating that charge only came to light as the result of Brady material furnished the defendants by an order of the court on February 14, 1991. In setting out these allegations, Gordon's attorney then addressed the information he wished to proffer concerning conversations he had over the previous two days with defendant Taylor's attorney. After some discussion about how the information should be handled, the court called for Taylor's attorney, as an officer of the court, to appear before the court and make a statement. In his statement, Taylor's attorney recounted how, through a Columbia attorney, Dwight Drake, he had learned that Cobb and an FBI agent had visited the home of a Steven Harley Smith in the early morning hours just prior to Taylor's trial. He stated he recognized the impact this incident could have on the Blanding/Gordon trial and had contacted Gordon's attorney. He stated that several attempts had been made to contact Smith, and that he learned through Drake that Smith was reluctant to get involved. His statement included the following as having been told to him by Dwight Drake: And he said that Mr. Ron Cobb and an FBI agent and he did not name the FBI agent, but he said an FBI agent brought him that the two of them came by Steve Smith's house. He said that they they had a conversation wherein they acknowledged that Senator John Lindsay of Bennettsville was very ill and that his wife was restricting his telephone calls and that it was difficult for just anybody to call and speak to Senator Lindsay. And they knew that Steve Smith was a very close friend of Senator Lindsay, and according to Mr. Drake Steve Smith was asked by Ron Cobb, or the FBI agent, or *646 both, to place a call down to Bennettsville to the Lindsay residence, and using his friendship, they felt sure he could get through to Senator Lindsay, that his wife would let him talk, and apparently that is what did occur. And according to Dwight, who told me this now, the 25th, there was a conversation between Mr. Cobb and Senator Lindsay which he overheard at least one end of. And it had to do with how he should characterize some money that had been given by Ron Cobb to Senator Lindsay. And apparently there was some discussion about whether that money could be characterized as a legal fee. And at the end of the conversation, you know, they left. [In Camera Hearing Tr., 2/27/91, pp. 31 2]. The following day, the hearing continued in camera with the attorneys for the government present. In addition to testimony of SA Richards as to the circumstances surrounding his 302 of May 1, 1989, and the testimony of both Cobb and SA Clemens as to Cobb's drug usage (both issues being addressed elsewhere in this order), both Cobb and SA Clemens testified with regard to the visit to the Smith home. The exchange on direct of Cobb by Gordon reads as follows: Q. If the monies that you gave Senator Lindsay were legitimate fees, then why did you have to make a deal that you wouldn't have to testify against Senator Lindsay? What had he done wrong, if there were no illegal monies passed to him. A. Well, from from my interpretation of the conversation with the FBI, they had other things going that I wasn't aware of. Q. Well, Mr. Cobb, if you weren't aware of them you couldn't testify about them, could you? A. That's correct. Q. So, that couldn't have been the reason for your agreement with the FBI that you wouldn't have to testify against Senator Lindsay? A. Well, obviously, I told obviously I told them the truth about the Magnum thing. And from their vantage point that would be a problem for Senator Lindsay. Q. So, now, the FBI told you it was a problem for Senator Lindsay? A. No, they didn't tell me it was a problem, this is my own I say that, I'm thinking this. Remember, this is back nearly two years ago when you know, you are refreshing me through this stuff. Q. I understand that. I don't have any problem with that. We will take as long as it takes. Before you agreed to talk to the FBI about anything, you told them, I'm caught, I will cooperate, I will talk to you about political corruption, but I won't testify against Jack Lindsay, did you not? 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 21 \f U.S. v. Taylor, 956 F.Supp. 622 (1997) A. I won't do anything against Jack Lindsay, that's correct. Q. And that included testifying? A. That's correct. Q. If you had not done or committed any illegal acts with Jack Lindsay, or if you had no knowledge of Jack Lindsay participating in any illegal acts, it wasn't necessary for you to have that agreement with the FBI, was it? A. My agreement was that I didn't have to testify against Senator Lindsay. Now, as to anything that he had done I know what you are getting at as far as anything that he had done, no, I'm not aware of it, but had there been I wasn't going to be involved in doing anything against the Senator. .... Q. And how did it come about that you contacted Senator Lindsay? A. Because the $10,000 to Magnum was I was going to have to testify to that in court. Senator Lindsay was laying up in the hospital bed dying, and I called. I'm I had a very close personal relationship with him, and I know this is going to hurt him. And I don't want to hurt him, for this to come out, so I was going to minimize it. *647 .... And I couldn't tell him about it, so I got Mike Clemens to, because I couldn't tell him what I was going to testify to and I didn't. Mike Clemens told him what was going to come out, and so it prepared Senator Lindsay for what was going to come out. Q. Isn't it a fact, Mr. Cobb, that the reason you called Senator Lindsay was to determine how you should characterize the $10,000 you gave to him? A. That is absolutely not true. [Gordon's Motion to Dismiss, 2/22/94, Exh. E, pp. 22 8]. The hearing transcript of February 28, 1991, will show that SA Clemens testified about that call to Lindsay on direct by Gordon as follows: Q. And y'all were discussing the fact that Mr. Cobb would probably be cross-examined concerning this $10,000 payoff that he had made to Representative Magnum through Senator Lindsay, correct? A. That's correct. Q. And the $10,000 that he gave Senator Lindsay to deliver the money to Representative Magnum? A. The monies he had paid Mr. Lindsay, yes. Q. And during that discussion, Mr. Cobb indicated that he needed to go call and explain to Senator Lindsay what was going on, is that how it came about? A. Pretty much.... He wanted to make sure that Mr. Lindsay was aware that it was going to come out. Q. And Mr. Cobb was concerned that Mr. Lindsay, Senator Lindsay would find out that he, Mr. Cobb, had told the government that he had made these different payoffs to Senator Lindsay, correct? A. He was concerned about that information, yes. [Id., Exh. D, pp. 24 5]. The record in the Taylor case was supplemented with the in camera proceedings in the Blanding/Gordon case, and at a motion hearing to reconsider Taylor's bond pending appeal held April 11, 1991, the court allowed Taylor to present the testimony of Steven Smith, who appeared under subpoena. In his testimony, Smith confirmed that he received a telephone call and a subsequent visit from Cobb and SA Clemens during the early morning hours of October 17, 1990. He stated that the Senator was not receiving telephone calls from basically anyone at the time. However, due to our friendship and closeness he would accept phone calls from me. He testified that due to the early morning hour he called the Senator's son and asked him to have Lindsay call him. In a further recitation about what transpired that night, Smith testified: A. Well, what was occurring is this. Mr. Cobb was insistent upon and this was the problem which was being addressed. Mr. Cobb when he arrived was insistent upon labeling any exchange of money which was to be brought up in testimony or questions in the case, Mr. Cobb intended 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 22 \f U.S. v. Taylor, 956 F.Supp. 622 (1997) to call that a legal fee. Whether it was or wasn't I don't know and was not familiar at the time with what exchanges of money they were talking about. Mr. Clemens was insistent to Mr. Cobb that he not label it a legal fee, but that he I believe the term to be used was call it what it was. Now, that can't be quoted, but Mr. Clemens was trying to move Mr. Cobb away from the legal fee label to what Mr. Clemens thought to be the truth. Mr. Cobb was resistant to doing that and was very upset that he was being asked to do that. It looked like, sounded like to me when he got there that Mr. Clemens had prevailed in his persuasiveness but Mr. Cobb had placed upon that as a condition or said he would do it if Senator Lindsay gave him the okay or that he knew that Senator Lindsay would not be upset with him for doing that. The purpose of the telephone call was to get Senator Lindsay on the phone so that Mr. Cobb could talk to him and hopefully seek that permission so that Ron could be convinced to go ahead and tell what Mr. Clemens thought was based on whatever information it was they thought to be the truth. *648 .... .... When Ron hung up the phone what he said was he told me and I think this is accurate. Again, it is the middle of the night something to the effect, To do what I had to do. .... A. That evening sitting in the breakfast room.... I asked him I said, Ron, what is all of this about? .... He told me then. He said, I told you, Steve, they had us jammed up on the oil jobbers bill. [Taylor Bond Hearing Tr., 4/11/91, pp. 20 1, 26]. Mr. Smith again testified under subpoena on October 18, 1995, at a hearing on the instant motions to dismiss: A. The issue between Mr. Cobb and Mr. Clemens was the testimony that Mr. Cobb was to give I believe the following day, if my memory is correct, in a trial, with regard to how Mr. Cobb would classify monies that were alleged to have been passed between Mr. Cobb and Senator Lindsay. I don't know what the monies were or anything, but they called them monies. Mr. Cobb was intending to, as related to me, and Mr. Clemens related that as well at some point during our conversation, that Mr. Cobb was going to classify whatever those monies were as an attorney's fee and that he had been authorized to do that by the United States Attorney. [Hearing, 10/18/95, Vol. I, pp. 221 2]. Smith's appearances before this court on these two occasions were under subpoena and his testimony was consistent. And, although Mr. Smith's opinion of the events was that SA Clemens was attempting to persuade Cobb to tell the truth when he testified, it also indicates that SA Clemens, himself, was not entirely truthful in his testimony at the hearing on February 27, 1991, when he described the purpose of the visit as one only to give information to Lindsay. Further, it indicates that Cobb also was not truthful in his testimony at the February 1991 hearing. The court must agree with the defendants' assessment that Lindsay was no stranger to publicity, and a notice to him that his name might appear in the media as a result of Cobb's testimony would certainly not warrant a telephone call to a dying man in the middle of the night. The involvement of an FBI agent in this entire incident was and is shocking to this court. Equally shocking is Cobb's testimony during the hearing on these motions on October 19, 1995. As a result of Smith's testimony that there was an argument between Cobb and SA Clemens as to whether Cobb would classify whatever those monies were as an attorney's fee and that he had been authorized to do that by the United States Attorney, the defendants called Cobb as a witness. Taylor on direct queried: Q. Mr. Cobb, my question to you is, did the United States Attorney tell you that you had his permission to label moneys that you had given Mr. Lindsay as legal fees? A. I had indicated to them that I would call the moneys anything they wanted me to call it, but I won't call it a bribe, and the terminology legals [sic] fees or contributions came up, and it was discussed, and I wasn't told not to use it. Q. Mr. Cobb, didn't you tell us in Mr. Spears' 34 office that you had a conversation with the U.S. Attorney and that he 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 23 \f U.S. v. Taylor, 956 F.Supp. 622 (1997) had told you it would be all right for you to call any money you gave Senator Lindsay a legal fee? A. Mr. Collins, that was in the course of our conversation, and as you will recall, we discussed that for a little while and I think I relayed to you that it was discussed, and I wasn't told not to, nobody ever said, you know nobody ever said, say this, or say that. I implied that I wouldn't say that it was a bribe, and they indicated that I could call it something else, and a legal fee was one of those terms. .... Q. Who told you that, sir? A. I just told, you several people in the U.S. Attorney's Office. Q. Tell me the name of the person who told you that? A. It could have been anybody in the U.S. Attorney's Office, Bart Daniel, John Barton, Dale DuTremble. *649 .... Q. Who? Q. .... Mr. Cobb, did Mr. Daniel, former U.S. Attorney, ever tell you that it was all right with him for you to call any moneys you gave Senator Lindsay legal fees? A. Maybe all of the above. Q. Who? A. It's really tough to answer that yes or no, without explaining A. I would leave it all of the above in the course of conversation. .... In course of conversations, THE WITNESS: the terminology, legal fees, came up. It was maybe suggested that that would be a possibility, because I was adamant about not calling any moneys I gave Senator Lindsay bribes, which I didn't, and don't to this day, but, yes, the term legal fees, by the U.S. Attorney was mentioned as something I could call it. [Hearing Tr., 10/19/95, Vol. II, pp. 24 5]. On cross-examination by the government, the exchange with Cobb on this subject continued: Q. Did Bart Daniel ever tell you you could call it legal fees? A. I have told you that's a very difficult question to say yes. In course of conversations it came up where I could call it legal fees, contributions, or what have you. .... THE WITNESS: Nobody ever programmed me to do that, but in the course of the conversation, it came up that it could be called a legal fee, it could be called contributions, but I wasn't going to call it a bribe. [Id. at pp. 43 4, 46 7]. Contrary to the government's argument that the defendants contend that Cobb had been given permission to call money he gave to Lindsay legal fees, [Gov. s Post Hearing Memo, 10/18/96, p. 25], it is Cobb who contends this in his sworn testimony. In his interview with the DOJ/OPR on September 8, 1994, USA Daniel responded to this allegation: I don't know why Cobb would say it. It never ever happened. On May 26, 1994, AUSA Barton told the DOJ/OPR: I recall nothing about someone coming up and saying to me Hey, Cobb asked if it was ok to call his payments to Lindsay a legal fee. And the notes of a telephone interview of AUSA DuTremble by the DOJ/OPR on November 10, 1994, show: No recollection of Bart D. or any AUSA authorizing Cobb to call payments to JL legal fees' as recalled by Steve Smith Surmises that Cobb may have interpreted USAO's position on the payments You can call it anything you want to as auth to characterize it as a legal fee . Although there is no sworn testimony in evidence to refute Cobb's claim, this court is loath to give credence to Cobb's testimony over the statements of these prosecutors. Although it does not make a specific finding as to Cobb's truthfulness in this regard, the court has no reason to dispute Smith's testimony that Cobb did, in fact, make the statement. 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 24 \f U.S. v. Taylor, 956 F.Supp. 622 (1997) 5. Drug Usage by Cobb. The defendants have argued extensively about Cobb's drug usage during the course of this entire matter. First of all, they complain of the withholding of evidence of his drug usage in possession of the government which was not furnished to them, thus hampering their efforts to impeach Cobb. Secondly, although they appear to argue that his drug usage may have affected his handling of the sting operation and his testimony, there is no real evidence that Cobb was, in fact, under the influence of drugs during these times. Thirdly, they utilize his repeated drug usage to bolster their argument that the government failed to control the actions *650 of a confidential informant in violation of FBI regulations; and, fourthly, they argue that the government's indictment of Cobb on two drug violations just prior to the Blanding/Gordon trial placed Cobb in a position to take the Fifth Amendment and further hamper their impeachment efforts. Cobb was first approached by the FBI on April 28, 1989, and within a day or two became a paid confidential informant. A formal agreement was not entered into with the government until October 11, 1989. On February 21, 1991, Cobb was two misdemeanor drug counts (21 U.S.C. 844(a)), for possession of cocaine on February 2, 1990, and January 11, 1991. He pled guilty to both counts on April 10, 1991. indicted on Cobb's drug usage on the dates of October 13, October 18 and November 18, 1989, was disclosed at the trials. In addition, the indictment for possession of cocaine on February 2, 1990, and January 11, 1991, was returned a few days prior to the Blanding/Gordon trial, and Cobb was allowed to invoke his Fifth Amendment rights as to these two incidents during his testimony at that trial. Cobb pled guilty to these incidents prior to the Derrick and Long trials. SA Clemens testified that he admonished Cobb on the three occasions in late 1989 that his drug usage was not only illegal, but was in violation of his agreement with the government; however, the government did not charge him or discontinue his employment. On July 17, 1990, Cobb testified before the Grand Jury that he had not used drugs since late 1989. Count One of the indictment to which he pled guilty would show his possession of cocaine in February of 1990; 35 therefore, this testimony, by Cobb's own admission, is false. In addition, Count Two of the indictment to which he pled guilty would show his possession of cocaine in January of 1991, which is within the time period between the Taylor trial and the Blanding/Gordon trial. The full scope of Cobb's drug usage was often sought by the defendants in their quest for discovery materials which might impeach Cobb's testimony at defendants' trials. On November 29, 1993, the defendants received a minimum of six FBI documents which revealed that Cobb had been under investigation by the FBI for drug violations since early 1988 [Taylor's Supp.Memo, 2/10/94, Exh. 2], and that he had used cocaine on at least two other previously unknown occasions in May of 1989, after he went to work for the FBI [Id., Exh. 3]. Several of these documents indicate that Cobb was reputed to be a cocaine trafficker and implicated others, such as Greer and Kohn. In contrast to representations by the government on the record in open court that they had given the defendants each and every tape they had [see Hearing Tr., 4/19/95, pp. 9 11], some 50 audiotapes and 118 FD 302s, which contain evidence bearing on Cobb's drug usage and trafficking, were received by defendants in February of 1995 [Taylor's Second Supp.Memo, 8/25/95, pp. 21 2]. It is now evident that Cobb had the reputation of a cocaine user and/or dealer and that this was known to the government prior to their employment of him in the sting. It is also evident that he purchased and/or used cocaine at least periodically during the time he was employed in the sting through the times he testified at the Taylor trial and at the Blanding/ Gordon trial. In his testimony regarding his drug usage, Cobb gave as reasons for the drug usage on which he was questioned as the need to protect his cover and, for one occasion, the emotional effect of the death of Lindsay. Cobb also claimed that the drug deal for which he was initially approached was done solely for the purpose of getting funds to pay his wife's medical bills. Just prior to his trial, Taylor offered to the court an affidavit by Cobb's wife, which was placed under seal, where she affirmatively stated that Cobb did not, in fact, contribute to the payment of her medical bills. *651 All of the defendants, possibly more so Taylor, Blanding and Gordon, were unable to impeach Cobb's 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 25 \f U.S. v. Taylor, 956 F.Supp. 622 (1997) testimony and confront him with the fact that he had been involved in drugs on more occasions and over a longer period of time than disclosed, and that his involvement in drugs was so deep that he had earned the reputation of a trafficker. This information was, of course, known to the government since at least February of 1988. A. Yes, ma'am, I did. Q. Was it on your house? A. Yes, ma'am, my home. 6. Evidence re Kohn. Kohn's involvement in the extensive use of cocaine and alcohol was admitted by him during the trials. On December 6, 1989, Cobb, as a government informant, participated in the videotaping of an occasion on which he purchased $500 worth of cocaine from Kohn. Kohn is then shown on the tape using cocaine. This tape (# 7) was not turned over to the defendants until sometime around the Derrick trial; however, Taylor concedes that he received a letter from the government very shortly before trial telling him that the government had evidence of Kohn giving cocaine to Cobb. He argues that he was deeply involved in preparing for trial; and, that since this is all that he was told, he did not take the time to pursue it. He indicates that had the government disclosed to him that a sale was recorded on video tape, and had he been told of the large amount of the purchase or that the tape showed the actual use of the cocaine by Kohn, he would have recognized its significance. Taylor contends that the jury's assessment of Kohn's credibility could well have been impacted by actually viewing Kohn snorting cocaine. Although it is the government's responsibility to disclose evidence to the defendants in a timely and honest manner, it is also the responsibility of the defense to review that evidence when it is disclosed. The reference by the court to this particular issue, therefore, is not to excuse Taylor's failure to review the tape, but simply to show the cumulative effect on the defense of potentially impeachable material not being fully or timely disclosed. The defendants argue that during the Taylor trial, in response to Taylor's effort to impeach Kohn, the government misled the court as to the relevancy of the issue of a personal insurance settlement by Kohn following Hurricane Hugo. The government objected on relevancy grounds when the defense attempted to cross-examine Kohn as follows: Q. Did you have an insurance claim personally? Q. How much did you receive for that? Was it $100,000? A. No it was not. Mr. Daniel: Your Honor, I object as to the relevance. The Court: It doesn't sound too relevant, Mrs. Courie. 36 [Taylor Trial Tr., Vol. IV, p. 141]. What the government knew, but was unknown to the defendant Taylor and the subsequent trial defendants, was that there existed a tape (Tape # 98), made on April 26, 1990, of a discussion between Cobb and Kohn which would have gone directly to Kohn's credibility. Cobb inquires about Kohn's weekend plans and the conversation continues: Kohn: Ah, I'm not sure. I got a It ain't nothing exciting, just try to get caught up on a couple (unintelligible) in Charleston and get all my stuff together for my financial insurance settlement. Cobb: Mm, hmm. Kohn: Now that was the greatest scam I've ever pulled off. Turned a $500 claim into a $100,000 settlement. Cobb: Wow. That would be your hit for the year. Kohn: Mm, hmm. Cobb: A nice one. Kohn: Insurance is (unintelligible) I, set this company up. I mean I set the insurance company so there is nothing they can do on it. Cobb: Huh? Kohn: Set them up the whole way through and, uh, said well I need to bring my dad *652 into contract. He says you don't need to bring anything. See I don't understand the instructions. I don't understand. He said all we're gonna talk about is how much money they're gonna give you. You see, the, the high, the lowest figure they're talking about 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 26 \f U.S. v. Taylor, 956 F.Supp. 622 (1997) borders in my range. (Unintelligible). I think I got them on unfair claims. (Unintelligible). [Audiotape # 98, 4/26/90]. The defendants refer to this tape as devastating evidence, which was not furnished to them until after this court's order of November 9, 1994. As well as being evidence material to the impeachment of Kohn, the first part of this same tape records a meeting concerning the pari-mutuel bill. The tape is unintelligible for the most part in this regard; however, it is significant that the cover sheet (FD 302) specifically lists Taylor as one of the speakers. It is impossible, therefore, for the court to understand how the government could consider this particular tape irrelevant. It is well established that the government must often take its witnesses as it finds them. Yet in this case, Kohn was not only employed by the government as a confidential informant after he was approached by the FBI in May of 1990, but he was used to assist Cobb in actively soliciting fellow legislators and became a significant player in the sting operation. 7. Control of Sting Operation by Cobb. Another of the defendants' allegations is that the government lost control over Cobb, its primary undercover informant. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals has referred to Cobb as the cornerstone of the government's case. The defendants allege that under the regulations governing this sting, Cobb was forbidden to go out looking for people to bribe this was to be strictly an open door operation. Yet we see that Cobb on occasion chose the legislators he wished to approach. 37 He was admonished that he could not use drugs during the course of the investigation, yet he repeatedly did so. It was Cobb who arranged the meetings with the defendants and notified the FBI when to turn on the video cameras. Cobb also convinced SA Clemens to participate with him in the very questionable 2:00 a.m. visit to Steve Smith's house and the telephone call to Lindsay. The government originally paid Cobb $2,000 per month and later raised the amount to $4,000 per month. It is part of the record that these payments continued through the original trials, but it is unknown to the court whether these monthly payments are still being made. In addition, the government returned to him the $20,000 cash payment Cobb had made to an undercover agent in the cocaine investment deal that precipitated his involvement in Lost Trust. A $150,000 bonus for Cobb has been approved by the government; however, the last mention of this that the court can find in the record is that the payment was put on hold, and whether this bonus has ever been paid to Cobb is unknown to the court. If not, this bonus takes on some significance should he be required to testify in any retrials. The court is of the opinion that Cobb maneuvered himself into the driver's seat position, and the government was a hostage to him. It is apparent that the government knew it had to court Cobb in order for him to work with them effectively. At times, he literally took over the investigation and directed its course. From its actions, it would *653 appear the government was afraid Cobb would pull out of the investigation and ruin their cases. According to a statement SA Clemens made to the OPR, Cobb flatly told the government from the very beginning that he would not testify against Lindsay and they could just take him to jail. Thus, Cobb forced the government on several important occasions into conduct not acceptable to the court. 8. Government Targets in Violation of Sting Guidelines. The portion of Cobb's manuscript cited above to show the control Cobb had over the investigation has also been cited by the defendants to show that Cobb was encouraged to use the sting operation to pursue individuals already targeted by the FBI in violation of FBI regulations and that selective prosecution was also an issue. In a teletype from the Director of the FBI to FBI Columbia, receive-stamped 89 NOV 1 [Taylor's Third Supp.Memo, 3/28/96, Exh. 4], in which the Columbia office is notified that the use of the pari-mutuel bill in this investigation is approved, the Columbia office is cautioned: Columbia should ensure that this scenario is executed pursuant to investigative plan outlined in UCO Proposal, i.e., a passive approach through contacts with predicated lobbyists. The defendants contend that this investigation was anything but passive. At a hearing on April 19, 1995, Gordon published several pages from the Cobb manuscript, The Second Burning of Columbia. 38 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 27 \f U.S. v. Taylor, 956 F.Supp. 622 (1997) COBB: B.J. Gordon, they had files on him; they had wanted him so f'n bad, they couldn't get him. D: Because they just didn't have the evidence? COBB: He had been to court two or three times. They had charged him two or three times. But he could always beat them. But he didn't outrun this boy. D: And yet the FBI was okay with that? I mean the FBI COBB: They wanted him bad, bad. [Hearing Tr., 4/19/95, p. 24]. He then continues to publish: D: Did you, the pari-mutuel, put on the table as the idea? My experience in Alabama is that pari-mutuel betting is a black issue. And you had to know when you put pari- mutuel betting on the table that you're going to have a skewed number of blacks. Did you know that? Did the FBI know that? COBB: Sure they knew it. I knew it. Hell, if I knew it I know they did. But we didn't discuss about the numbers. I'd talk a lot of times, I would make the comment a lot of times that I could have the whole black caucus. There would be no more damn niggers. It was kind of funny to them for a while until we got half of them and they said, pull in the reins, but believe me, we could have had most of them. Because you throw out some dollars and the mother f's first are going to be knocking the doors down. They were easy. Even B.J. as much trouble as they had with him. Shit I got him. The way I got him, f, you don't get away from it. [Id. at pp. 24 5]. The above statements by Cobb would certainly indicate that the investigation went far outside the guidelines set forth for this sting. 9. The Report by the OPR As hereinbefore mentioned, following the filing of the Taylor and Gordon motions to dismiss, USA J. Preston Strom, in February 1994, requested the Office of Professional Responsibility of the Department of Justice (DOJ/OPR) to investigate the allegations of prosecutorial misconduct raised by the defendants' motions. This procedure was unusual in that such investigations generally are not conducted by the OPR until after a judicial finding of misconduct. The OPR bifurcated the investigation, requesting the FBI/OPR to investigate the *654 allegations against SA Clemens. The DOJ/OPR then proceeded to address only the USAO's failure to provide the two 302s complained of in both motions, those appearing to be the documents which raise the most serious misconduct issues. [Hearing, 4/19/95, Defs. Exh. 30, p. 10, ftn. 15]. These are the 302s dated June 22, 1989 and September 25, 1989 (the secret 302), which were not received by the defendants until November 1993. Both of these 302s dealt with Cobb's characterization of the cash payments he made to the defendants. Taylor's motion also included arguments of intentional wrongdoing in the government's failure to produce numerous additional documents, but the investigation did not address these. On December 6, 1994, the FBI/OPR reported its findings to the DOJ/OPR [Id., Exh. 45], and the DOJ/OPR amended its report to include these findings on February 16, 1995 [Id., Exh. 44]. The October 18th report concludes that, although ..., mistakes incremental and misjudgments were made by the FBI and prosecutors alike in our view, it is more plausible that these incremental failings rather than any intentional and wrongful decision to conceal led to the failure in the first two Lost Trust cases to provide the defense with the 302s dated June 22 and September 25, 1989. [Id., Exh. 30, p. 22]. The amended report of February 16, 1994, made a finding that sanctions against SA Clemens were warranted as a result of the following infractions: as case ... failure to effectively discharge his duties in connection with the management of discovery documents transmitted to the USAO; his failure to properly agent 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 28 \f U.S. v. Taylor, 956 F.Supp. 622 (1997) review all of his interview reports to properly prepare for testimony; unintentional misrepresentation in trial testimony; failure to properly maintain investigative notes in accordance with Bureau rules and regulations; failure to inform either the USAO or the Bureau upon discovery of the interview notes and his subsequent neglect of duty to report such an action as required in light of the controversy surrounding his testimony; and failure to advise OPR of the interview notes. [Id., Exh. 44, p. 13]. The sanctions imposed have been previously cited in this order. During its investigation, the OPR conducted numerous interviews, the notes of which, by order of the court, were furnished to the court and the defendants. The defendants have vigorously contested the limited scope of the investigation and the report. They question the decision to focus on only two 302s in light of their numerous allegations; they contend that numerous interviews were not incorporated into the report, and that the report does not accurately reflect the results of the interviews conducted. The court must agree in that there is an obvious omission of any consideration of the statement given to the OPR by SA Dick that it was clear to him that the monies Cobb paid to Lindsay were in violation of the Hobbs Act even though Cobb would never allow these transactions to be characterized as bribes and that this was discussed many times among SA Clemens, the USAO and himself. SA Dick, as the supervisor of the White Collar Crime section of the Criminal Division, was thus the supervisor of the Lost Trust investigation. His statement that these discussions frequently occurred do not appear to be taken into consideration by the FBI/OPR in its determination as to Clemens alleged perjury on February 28, 1991. At the time the DOJ/OPR and FBI/OPR investigations took place, only the motions of defendants Taylor and Gordon were under consideration; joinder by defendants Blanding, Derrick and Long in these motions and the filing of Derrick's dismissal motion came later. Further, the motions of Taylor and Gordon address issues based on additional discovery received in November of 1993. Subsequently, the government was ordered by several court orders to furnish other materials, which have led to additional allegations of misconduct not addressed by the OPR. The court has carefully reviewed all of the interview notes. Although it will not make a definitive finding of misconduct by the OPR, it does appear that many questions were left either uninvestigated and/or unanswered. *655 Some of the pending allegations arose from additional discovery now in the hands of the defendants that was not before the OPR. The government continues to rely heavily on the findings of the OPR; this court does not share in that view. Therefore, it is only in a limited context that the court has considered the OPR's conclusions. The OPR report did reveal that the government rushed into the Taylor trial before it was prepared to go to court. AUSA DuTremble has cited pressure by the Governor [Hearing, 10/18 20/95, Gordon Exh. P] as a reason for the government's haste. Other prosecutors indicated that it was important to the government to convict Taylor early on in the hope that other defendants would plead guilty as a result. It is also reflected in the report that during the investigation and preparation for trial there was utter confusion as to discovery and some dissention in the ranks both at the FBI and the AUSO, and that no real guidance was provided by the FBI to SA Clemens, a first-office agent. In addition, in light of the pending trial status of these defendants, they object on the grounds of prejudicial pretrial publicity to a press conference held by FBI Director Louis Freeh on a visit to Columbia, South Carolina, following the issuance of the OPR report, in which he announced that the government had been cleared of all misconduct allegations. This press conference by Director Freeh presents a serious problem for the court. The lofty respect inherent in his position in the minds of the public is probably unparalleled. The legal position of these defendants at this time is that they are under indictment pending trial. Although some of the evidence before this court in its consideration of the motions to dismiss for prosecutorial misconduct may not be admissible at trial under the Federal Rules of Evidence, certainly much of it would be. A pretrial public statement by the FBI Director that this evidence has already been found to be without merit is appalling to this court. 10. Continuing Discovery Problems. 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 29 \f U.S. v. Taylor, 956 F.Supp. 622 (1997) This court has found that the government continued to incrementally provide evidence relative to these motions even after recusal of the USAO for South Carolina and the appointment of attorneys from the Public Integrity Section of the DOJ in Washington. A review of the record will show that, following a status conference on October 20, 1994, the court in a written order filed November 9, 1994, ORDERED, that the United States make available to the within-named defendants, their attorneys and agents, no later than December 1, 1994, all audiotapes and videotapes and all reports of interviews (FBI FD 302s) and agents' rough notes pertinent thereto resulting from the Operation Lost Trust investigation. [Order, 11/9/94, p. 2]. Some ten protective orders and orders ruling on requested in camera review were then filed by the court. On March 15 and 17, 1995, defendants Taylor and Gordon filed discovery motions relative to the motions to dismiss, which were heard on April 19, 1995. On April 20, 1995, the court ORDERED, that all documents and/ or materials in possession of the government dealing with these cases and not presently available to the defendants in the evidence room be produced by the government direct to the court at Charleston, South Carolina, not later than Monday, May 8, 1995, for in camera inspection by internal administrative documents alleged by the government to be privileged are to be designated as such upon submission. the court. .... All [Order, 4/19/95, p. 3]. Twelve boxes of documents were submitted by the government to the court for in camera review, and a detailed 21 page discovery order was filed as to the disposition of the materials therein on July 25, 1995. In this order the court notes: Defendants argue that the pattern and practice of behavior by the government has instilled in them a deep sense of mistrust and that a full in camera inspection of all materials in possession of the government was warranted. The government, although acknowledging the existence of an open file policy, has continued to argue *656 as to what is and is not discoverable pursuant to Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194 [10 L.Ed.2d 215] (1963). In response to defendants' argument that the 65 audio tapes furnished in March 1995 should have been furnished with discovery materials for the original trials, the government claims that they dealt exclusively with drugs; that they were not turned over because they had not been and would not be used at trial, and, therefore, they were not relevant and not discoverable under Brady. The court finds the government's argument in this regard ludicrous. The record in these cases is clear that the drug investigation was hand-in-glove with the corruption investigation known as Lost Trust. Ten of the twenty-eight defendants pled to drug charges. Although the purpose of this order is not to address the motions to dismiss, government arguments such as this cause the court to look very closely at what was withheld by the government that may have jeopardized the rights of these defendants. There also has been much discussion throughout these cases of the impact of an investigation by the government into federal violations in the handling of legislation known as the capital gains tax bill that had come before the South Carolina Legislature. The defendants claim there was a cover-up by the government and that they were not furnished the discovery needed to pursue the calling and/or impeachment of witnesses. The government acknowledges the investigation but states emphatically that it found this to be a non-issue and not relevant to the trials of these defendants. Again, the court does not wish at this time to make a finding on the merits of either argument; however, inasmuch as one of the key figures in the Lost Trust investigation pled to a RICO violation, one of the predicate offenses of which was the taking of a bribe from the government's cooperating subject and key Lost Trust witness, Ron Cobb, in relation to the capital gains tax bill, the government cannot now claim that its investigation into improprieties relevant to the capital gains tax legislation was irrelevant to these cases. The court, therefore, can understand the defendants' arguments of mistrust. 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 30 \f U.S. v. Taylor, 956 F.Supp. 622 (1997) [Order, 7/25/95, pp. 6 8]. This order also set forth a schedule for the filing of additional memorandums and set an evidentiary hearing on the subject motions for October 18, 1995. In the interim, the government furnished additional materials for in camera inspection on two separate occasions, and the court issued its rulings with regard to these materials on September 7 and October 6, 1995. The October 6th order addresses a file received by the court which included copies of the materials [obviously discoverable FD 302s and agents' rough notes], and further states in pertinent part: It is unnecessary for the court to reiterate here the lengthy history of discovery problems in these cases. Suffice it to say that the materials furnished to the defendants and to the court on October 4, 1995, should have been furnished long ago. [Order, 10/6/95, p. 2]. The first hearing on the motions to dismiss had been set for October 18, 1995, since the previous July. Yet here, just short of a year after the court's order establishing the evidence room and just two weeks prior to a hearing of the motions, the government was still turning over relevant evidence to these defendants. In addition, during the October 1995 hearing the existence of several FBI CW (Cooperating Witness) files came to light. One of the files contained an FD 302 not previously furnished to defendants. Defendants also moved for this court to reconsider portions of its July 25, 1995 order, and the court agreed to an in camera inspection of the CW files and several of the boxes of materials denied to defendants on July 25th. At the October hearing, the defendants also requested and received from the FBI computer-generated printouts of the inventories of the FBI's entire Lost Trust and Capital Gains files. On January 19, 1996, defendant Taylor moved the court to direct the government to provide access to all of the documents identified thereon. The court's order of February 6, 1996, as amended February 23, 1996, resulted. *657 The court's frustration at this point is evident in its February 6th order, which states in part: It is well past time for discovery to be completed. Although the court in no way wishes to jeopardize the investigative methods of the federal government, it is clear from a review of the records now before it that little, if anything, contained therein can still be classified as sensitive. Additionally, all of the materials furnished are subject to protective orders restricting the use and dissemination of these materials. The court has previously opined that a wider latitude must be given with regard to materials to be furnished for the purposes of the defendants' pursuit of their motions to dismiss for prosecutorial misconduct than might be given for trial preparation. The alleged misconduct of government attorneys and agents during the preparation and trials of these cases is the basis for the defendants' motions, and defendants' argument that they are entitled to a thorough review of the government's records is not without merit, particularly in light of the discovery history in these matters. .... ... although there may be some justification for the delay in furnishing some materials to the defendants as ordered by the court, the volume of the materials which have surfaced just over the past few months and their possible significance to the defendants is of concern to the court. [Order, 2/6/96, pp. 7 8]. In its Post Hearing Memorandum, the government attempts to explain why certain files were not submitted to the court as and when ordered. As shown above, the court ordered the government to make available to the defendants all documents known by the government to be of a nature to be used by defendants to impeach witnesses or support the defendants' theories of their defenses. These cases were and are being prosecuted by various government attorneys, and for various reasons they have withheld documents that would have been of assistance to the defendants in defending the charges against them. The government now concedes that numerous mistakes were made in furnishing discovery and the DOJ/OPR in its report found that incremental and misjudgments were made by the FBI mistakes 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 31 \f U.S. v. Taylor, 956 F.Supp. 622 (1997) and prosecutors alike and, in our view, it is more plausible that these incremental failings rather than any intentional and wrongful decisions to conceal led to the failure in the first two Lost Trust cases to provide the defense with the 302s [required]. [Gov's Post Hearing Memo, 10/18/96, p. 6]. The court cannot agree with this finding because the failings of the government to provide meaningful discovery were so numerous that it would be disingenuous to say that these mistakes were incremental failings rather than intentional or wrongful decisions. In fact, these failings, spanned over the time from the beginning of these cases until just several months ago, amount to a pattern of conduct. In undisputed testimony on October 3, 1996 [Hearing Tr., 10/3/96, p. 182], the court was informed that prior to his trial Taylor received only 66 of the 550 plus or minus 302s and 26 of the 227 plus or minus tapes that are now in defendants' possession. The number of 302s and tapes received pretrial by the other defendants would vary only slightly. VI. THE COURT'S SUPERVISORY POWER In the case of United States v. Banks, 383 F.Supp. 389 (D.S.D.1974), appeal dismissed, United States v. Means, 513 F.2d 1329 (8th Cir.1975), that court, in a Memorandum Decision treating defendants' motion for acquittal as a motion to dismiss for government misconduct, dismissed with prejudice the charges against the defendants by the use of its supervisory power. The Banks court, citing to McNabb v. United States, 318 U.S. 332, 63 S.Ct. 608, 87 L.Ed. 819 (1943), decided that the court's supervisory power can be utilized whenever the administration of justice is tainted, and, indeed, it is the court's duty to [establish] and [maintain] civilized standards of procedure and evidence. [Id. at 340, 63 S.Ct. at 613]. Some of the circuits *658 have found that demonstrable prejudice must exist in order for the court to exercise its supervisory power; however, the court in Banks found that it need not address whether due process was offended when the facts showed such aggravated conduct as to warrant dismissal. In the Fourth Circuit case, United States v. Omni Intern. Corp., 634 F.Supp. 1414 (D.Md.1986), Judge Black discusses the requirement of prejudice and concludes that [a] common thread underlying many decisions is that the magnitude of the misconduct affects the use of the supervisory power, whether or not actual prejudice is shown. Id. at 1438. See, e.g., United States v. Serubo, 604 F.2d 807, 818 (3d Cir.1979) (prosecutorial conduct extreme); United States v. Hogan, 712 F.2d 757 (2d Cir.1983) (misconduct flagrant); United States v. Fischbach & Moore, Inc., 576 F.Supp. 1384, 1396 (W.D.Pa.1983) (isolated incident of misconduct). This court has weighed the seriousness of the [3] [2] misconduct against the available remedies, and finds that, as in the Banks and Omni cases, the misconduct here is repetitious, flagrant and longstanding. See Banks, 383 F.Supp. at 392; Omni, 634 F.Supp. at 1438; United States v. Hogan, 712 F.2d at 761; United States v. Lawson, 502 F.Supp. 158, 172 (D.Md.1980). I also find that the government's misconduct need not be so unfair or imprudent as to offend due process' before exercise of this [court's] supervisory power is appropriate. McNabb, 318 U.S. at 340, 63 S.Ct. at 613. Although this court is of the opinion that the sixth amendment right to a fair trial guaranteed to each of these defendants has been jeopardized because of the government's actions throughout these proceedings, the Constitutional issues raised by the instant motions need not be addressed. The court is convinced that this investigation began in an appropriate fashion. It is, after all, the responsibility of the FBI and the USAO to pursue information with regard to illegal acts within their jurisdiction. It is the opinion of the court, however, that some of the investigators and lead prosecutors got lost on their way to the lofty goal of weeding out drugs and corruption from the South Carolina State House. Overzealousness and political pressure upon those in positions of authority appear to be the detours that led the government to rush to trial, especially in the cases of Taylor, Blanding and Gordon; to withhold volumes of exculpatory evidence; to allow perjured testimony to stand uncorrected on more than one occasion; to allow its primary cooperating witness, Cobb, to take an unusual amount of control of the sting operation; to go outside of its own regulations to target certain legislators, and to mislead this court to such an extent as to perpetrate a fraud upon the court. While lawyers representing private parties may indeed, must do everything ethically permissible to advance their clients' interests, lawyers representing the government in 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 32 \f U.S. v. Taylor, 956 F.Supp. 622 (1997) criminal cases serve truth and justice first. The prosecutor's job isn't just to win, but to win fairly, staying well within the rules. [Citations omitted]. As Justice Douglas once warned, [t]he function of the prosecutor under the Federal Constitution is not to tack as many skins of victims as possible to the wall. His function is to vindicate the right of people as expressed in the laws and give those accused of crime a fair trial. Donnelly v. DeChristoforo, 416 U.S. 637, 648 49, 94 S.Ct. 1868, 1874, 40 L.Ed.2d 431 (1974) (Douglas, J., dissenting). U.S. v. Kojayan, 8 F.3d 1315, 1323 (9th Cir.1993). Almost without exception, the lead prosecutors in these cases had practiced before this court many times, and the open file policy of this district and this court had never before come into question. USA Daniel was an Assistant U.S. Attorney in Charleston for several years and prosecuted high-profile, multi-defendant cases before this court. The open file policy was never disputed during those trials, and Daniel was totally familiar with it. As the United States Attorney guiding the prosecution of the within cases, it was his responsibility to oversee the handling of discovery. The withholding of such a voluminous array of discovery which the government had to know was exculpatory and relevant to the defenses of these defendants is unprecedented before this court. The court *659 finds that these violations are too numerous and too specific to certain issues to be considered simply unintentional or the result of neglect. For example, it is unfathomable that the government could have possibly considered the drug investigation of Cobb prior to his employment as a confidential informant, or the investigation of Cobb, Lindsay and Greer in the capital gains tax investigation, as anything but relevant. Even more offensive to the court are the continual misrepresentations made to the court that all discovery to which the defendants were entitled had been turned over to them. The government had to have been aware of so much information that incriminated public figures holding powerful positions, yet it did not submit to the court for review the discovery it claimed would jeopardize on-going investigations or that it claimed to be irrelevant. The constant assurances that we have given them everything, the veracity of which the court had no reason at that time to question, rises to the level of outrageous conduct. It would be impossible to cite to each instance where this type of assurance was repeated. It appears that in these cases, much of the government's misconduct actually stems from its failure to disclose evidence to the defendants. In the case of United States v. DeMarco, 407 F.Supp. 107 (C.D.Cal.1975), the withholding of exculpatory evidence alone was sufficient to grant a dismissal of the indictment, albeit without prejudice. His [the prosecutor's] duty is to provide exculpatory evidence to the defense and then seek to rebut it before the trier of fact. It is not the prosecutor's function to structure a proceeding in such a way that exculpatory material is concealed from the defense, the court, and the jury. Id. at 112. In addition, the court finds that the government, during the period following remand of these cases and in connection with the instant motions, continued its course of action with regard to the disclosure of evidence, in violation of court orders. Its attitude concerning discovery continued well into 1996, even after the court admonished it that the determination of relevancy of the materials relating to the motions to dismiss was within the jurisdiction of the court and not the government. The court is of the opinion that an investigation and subsequent prosecution of what might have started out with the altruistic motive of ridding the State Legislature of drugs and political corruption became a political bombshell that backfired. The entire Lost Trust matter was a political coup as well as a political hot potato for the United States Attorney's Office. USA Daniel called a press conference to announce the initial indictments. The defendants had claimed that this press conference constituted prejudicial pretrial publicity and they now question whether authority for it was even given USA Daniel, as required, by the Department of Justice. No substantial evidence one way or the other on the question of authority was ever offered, nor does the court find that the defendants have offered any additional testimony to meet the burden of proving that they were directly prejudiced by this press conference. 39 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 33 \f U.S. v. Taylor, 956 F.Supp. 622 (1997) This press conference did create, however, an atmosphere of public expectation from which the government could not retreat, even when the investigation led to roads it did not want to travel. When they chose Cobb as the focal point of the sting, they had to carry all the baggage he brought with him his drug use, his refusal to involve Lindsay, his apparent inability to be totally truthful, and his unwillingness to follow instructions. The government lost control of its star witness, both during the sting operation and during his testimony at the trials. This allowed Cobb to choose the legislators he wished to *660 solicit, specifically, Derrick, Gordon and members of the Black Caucus for whatever his purposes and to protect those he wished by characterizing as he saw fit the payments he made to them, even to the point of perjuring himself with regard to payoffs he made to Lindsay. Evidence of how Cobb often paid various legislators a few hundred dollars to keep them friendly and that it was no concern of his how the recipients handled the monies, was not furnished by the government so as to allow the defendants to attempt to impeach Cobb's testimony that the payments he made to these defendants (excluding Long) were known by him and by them to be bribes. The court further finds that the government did, in fact, allow testimony from Cobb, Clemens and Greer that it knew to be untrue to stand uncorrected. This court shares the concern expressed by the court in United States v. Wallach, 935 F.2d 445, 457 (2d Cir.1991): We fear that given the importance of [a witness's] testimony to the case, the prosecutors may have consciously avoided recognizing the obvious [that he] was not telling the truth. Once the government entered into the agreement with Cobb that he would never have to testify against Lindsay, it put itself in an untenable position. Its cases against these defendants rested in large measure on Cobb's testimony at trial. Sufficient evidence has now been disclosed to prove that Cobb did pay a bribe to Lindsay in connection with the capital gains tax bill and, further, that Cobb admitted as early as May 1, 1989, that he had paid Lindsay a bribe in connection with the oil jobbers bill. His sworn testimony that he never paid Lindsay a bribe was perjurious several times over. Unfortunately, SA Clemens had helped to dig the hole in which he found himself and, apparently, felt he had to play out the scenario to the end. When the government found itself in a position which forced it to investigate Greer, the situation became even more explosive. There is no way the court can ignore the inconsistencies in and omissions from the record in the matter of Greer and the capital gains tax bill. The government's actions as outlined in this order suggest a total avoidance of pursuing information that might have proved adverse to Greer. The record is replete with implications that Greer was heavily involved in the payoffs related to the capital gains tax bill, yet no FD 302s or agents' rough notes of any debriefings of Greer regarding capital gains and no indication the government ever sought to review his financial records can be found. Even the information advanced by the government at Greer's sentencing that would tend to be in Greer's favor is not substantiated by anything in the record. His testimony before the Grand Jury would have to be perjured if the arguments advanced by the government at Greer's sentencing hearing are true. Alternatively, if Greer told the truth to the Grand Jury, then the government has lied to the court. The government's failure to fully investigate Greer might be excused as falling within the province of the government's prosecutorial discretion if his alleged involvement was isolated. The fact that it surfaced in an investigation resulting in the convictions of these defendants and may have had an impact on the fairness of their trials puts the government's handling of Greer's involvement in an entirely different light. Most offensive to the court, however, is that the government sat silent when it knew that its silence would not only foil the efforts of the defendants to fully develop defenses to which they were entitled, but would misrepresent facts to both the Grand Jury and the trial jury, and mislead the court to such an extent as to effect its rulings at trial and in collateral proceedings. As reluctant as this court is to call it such this silence in several instances constitutes subornation of perjury. This court will not shrink from its share of responsibility and admits its total reliance on the government's representations, at least through the original trials. It did warn the government on numerous occasions that, if it was not being candid and forthright, the court would take the appropriate steps available to it. Without the defendants' unrelenting pursuit of their motions, however, much of what is now known may never have seen the light of day. The government attempts *661 to show its willingness to own up to any misconduct in a footnote to its final memorandum, stating that it was the 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 34 \f U.S. v. Taylor, 956 F.Supp. 622 (1997) expanded discovery voluntarily furnished by the government following remand that led to these motions and not the defendants' own investigative work or requests under the FOIA. [Gov's Post Hearing Memo, 10/18/96, p. 29, ftn. 13]. Considering the on-going discovery problems in these cases, the court finds this absurd. Because the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals was also unaware of the substantial amount and probative content of discovery materials withheld, had these cases not been remanded for retrial on entirely different grounds, the convictions of these defendants would stand. It was not until the first wave of discovery for retrials, which contained numerous previously withheld documents, was furnished in November of 1993 that the court had any reason to believe that some of its previous rulings were based on limited and/or erroneous information. Thereafter, for the purposes of the motions to dismiss, it allowed great latitude in the disclosure of discovery materials. Only then was the wide-ranging scope of the government's misconduct available to the defendants and apparent to the court. There is no way to avoid the conclusion that the various and repeated acts of the government were simply wrong; that the government acted in bad faith, and its misconduct is not only greatly offensive to this court, but has interfered with this court's duty to insure the proper administration of justice. In summary, the court is of the opinion that the evidence of the government's misconduct from the time this investigation commenced until the present, in its totality, is sufficiently egregious to warrant dismissal of these indictments with prejudice under the doctrine of supervisory power. It is, therefore, ORDERED, that the Superseding Indictment in Criminal Nos. 3:90 00339 and 3:90 00434 against defendants LUTHER LANGFORD TAYLOR, LARRY BLANDING and BENJAMIN J. GORDON, JR. be, and the same is hereby dismissed with prejudice. It is ORDERED FURTHER, that the Indictment in Criminal No. 3:91 00091 against defendant PAUL WAYNE DERRICK be, and the same is hereby dismissed with prejudice. It is ORDERED FURTHER, that the Indictment in Criminal No. 3:91 00384 against defendant JEFFERSON MARION LONG, JR. be, and the same is hereby, dismissed with prejudice. AND IT IS SO ORDERED. Footnotes 1 2 The court has also sought to develop some of the issues by reviewing other documents on record in the evidence room. In the interest of brevity and continuity, the designations of the defendants by their surnames are used to denote the defendants personally and, where appropriate, to denote the defendants by and through their attorneys. Three other defendants indicted as a result of the Operation Lost Trust investigation went to trial on Hobbs Act charges. The convictions of two of these defendants were upheld by the Appeals Court; the third was found not guilty. All other Lost Trust defendants pleaded to either corruption or drug charges. The record subsequently shows that the government made a decision to start over on discovery by providing it again. [DOJ/OPR Report, 10/18/4, p. 10]. Derrick also filed a separate motion to dismiss on grounds of prosecutorial misconduct and entrapment on April 19, 1995, which he supplemented on September 5, 1995. The government filed its opposition on September 27, 1995. In the summer of 1996, Derrick requested consideration of this motion without oral argument on the issue of entrapment only, and dismissal on this ground was denied by this court's order of August 7, 1996. Upon Daniel's resignation as United States Attorney, John S. Simmons was appointed in early 1992 to that post. Upon Simmons' resignation effective in April of 1993, Margaret B. Seymour was appointed Interim U.S. Attorney, followed by the interim appointment of J. Preston Strom in May 1993. Strom's permanent appointment became effective July 30, 1993. The reports of the DOJ/OPR and FBI/OPR dated October 18, 1994, December 6, 1994, and February 16, 1995 [Hearing 4/19/95, Defendants Exhibits 30, 45 and 44 respectively] will be discussed later in this order. The disclosure of discovery to defendants is primarily the responsibility of the USAO. Unless so distinguished, however, subsequent references herein to the government include all of the government agencies involved in the investigation and prosecution of these cases. In the eyes of the court there is no difference. Those indicted for crimes have a right to 3 4 5 6 7 8 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 35 \f U.S. v.

One agency cannot point its finger at another, declaring it's their fault it's not our fault. It is the United States, represented by the United States Attorney, that is seeking redress; and, if a defendant does not receive a fair trial because of the failure of any one agency, that failure must be imputed to the government as a whole. From this period on, the court conducted numerous in camera inspections of discovery materials at the request of the government. All documents ordered to be turned over to the defendants were done so under protective orders. The Capital Gains Tax issue is fully addressed hereinafter in this order. Under the terms of this conditional severance, defendant Gordon was rejoined in this matter by order of January 21, 1997. Hereinafter, the designation USA is used to denote United States Attorney; the designation AUSA is used to denote Assistant United States Attorney, and the designation USAO is used to denote United States Attorney's Office. This motion was denied by The Honorable Charles E. Simons, Jr., U.S.D.J., who was originally assigned to hear this case. The case was subsequently reassigned to the undersigned. Co-defendant Fant had pled three days before. This disclosure followed a hearing on defendant Gordon's Brady motions of November 5, 1990, and January 7, 1991, wherein the court directed the government to furnish the specified material. An FBI FD 302 (sometimes referred to herein simply as a 302) is a government form used by the FBI. Its Manual of Administrative Operations and Procedures, Part II, Section 10 12(3), requires that [o]riginal notes of interview with prospective witnesses and/or suspects and subjects must be retained in the 1A section of the case file. That is, in any interview where preparation of an FD 302 is required (an interview where it is anticipated the results will become the subject of court testimony) the rough handwritten notes are to be retained. The defendants argue that these FD 302s allowed the primary government witness Cobb to testify falsely. They also dispute the government's conclusion that these two FD 302s form the only basis for their Brady violation allegations. Robert Alfred Kohn, who was indicted with Taylor and who pled guilty as previously cited. Kohn also became a government informant later in the investigation. The government's memorandum expands on several of these arguments, but, as mentioned earlier in this order, the specifics of the allegations will be addressed later in this order. The motions filed in connection with the initial trials have been incorporated by the defendants with the motions to dismiss filed post-remand in these matters. Cobb testified at the Long trial that he knew Long was not accepting a bribe under the circumstances in which the money was exchanged. A complete listing of the legislators checked off by Cobb includes State Senators James E. Bryan, Herbert U. Fielding, Donald H. Holland, John C. Land, Hugh K. Leatherman, W. Richard Lee, John C.

From time to time in the past she has been employed at Collins and Lacy, P.C., her husband's law firm. She has worked without compensation on Taylor's case continuously since its inception, primarily handling the organization of documents. The government did not oppose her qualifications to testify in this regard. 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 36 \f U.S. v. Taylor, 956 F.Supp. 622 (1997) 23 24 Also found in these records were copies of seven (7) checks payable to State Senator John Charles Lindsay of Marlboro County, South Carolina, including two (2) $10,000 checks and one (1) check for over $20,000. [Hearing 10/18 20/95, Taylor's Exh. 12]. Taylor was first approached about 9:00 a.m. on July 17, 1990, in the driveway of his home by three FBI agents. They requested that he accompany them to their offices. He was interviewed for approximately seven hours, during which time he admitted receipt of monies from Cobb that he considered to be campaign contributions. Late in the afternoon, Taylor acquiesced to appearing before the Grand Jury. He was not told he was a target of the investigation, was not given a Miranda warning before testifying, and was not asked in the Grand Jury how he categorized the monies he received from Cobb. Following his testimony, he was taken to a local motel where agents stayed with him overnight in shifts. Clemens testified at Taylor's trial that Taylor was kept in FBI custody because they were concerned that he was depressed to the point of being suicidal. However, they also bought him a liter of Scotch whiskey, and it is curious they chose a known depressant, alcohol, to assist him through this suicidal state. 25 Wade Ronald Crow, who was indicted with House Speaker John I. Rogers, III, and pled to one count of aiding and 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 abetting extortion under the Hobbs Act. Derrick has also pursued a defense of entrapment and cites in his memorandums and arguments to specific evidence that was withheld which he believes would have supported this defense. In light of the findings herein, the court need not address the entrapment issue. Any grounds for dismissal of the indictment of Long, outside of those for prosecutorial misconduct, need not be addressed at this time. In its opinion dated May 29, 1992, in the Taylor case, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals stated: The government argues that Cobb's testimony was not critical to its case and that his credibility was not a significant issue at trial, but a review of the transcript reveals that these arguments are ludicrous. Cobb was the cornerstone of the prosecution's case and his credibility was the paramount issue at trial. USA v. Taylor, 966 F.2d 830, 837 (4th Cir.1992). The late Thomas Magnum, a member of the South Carolina House of Representatives. Defendants further contend that SA Clemens, in fact, had previously testified at an evidentiary hearing in open court. These notes were among other Lost Trust investigation work papers Clemens maintained at his home in the Washington area. The court is aware that the government claims that Lobbyist Lee was helpful to them in the Derrick case. The only Grand Jury transcript regarding capital gains not removed from the AUSO's file cabinet at this time was the transcript of Greer's testimony which had been previously pulled from the files. Michael E. Spears, an attorney representing Cobb at that time. This incident took place only three (3) days prior to his meeting with defendant Taylor regarding Taylor's support of the parimutuel bill. Yolanda C. Courie, co-counsel for defendant Taylor. In his motion to dismiss on the grounds of entrapment, defendant Derrick claims that Cobb added Derrick to his target list in revenge for Cobb's loss of a client when Derrick would not support legislation known as the Tent Sales bill. In post- remand discovery furnished to defendants there was found a government file dated April 30, 1991, which contained what appears to be a manuscript of a proposed book by Cobb entitled The Second Burning of Columbia. The manuscript is in the form of an interview of Cobb ( R ) and his then-girlfriend, Shelly Adams ( S ), by D , later identified by the government as Doug Williams. A portion of that manuscript reads as follows: D You knew who they [the government] had files on going in? So there really was, there was a definite universe of people that you were charged with going after? R Yeah. D Did you add to that universe at all for the hell of it? R Yeah. Paul Derrick big time. [Hearing, 4/19/95, Taylor Exh. 7, p. 27]. 38 39 The government did not oppose the publication of this selected portion of the manuscript. It did oppose full publication on the basis of protection of any copyright privilege Cobb might assert. The court would take note, however, that it was inappropriate for the USAO to conduct that press conference from a courtroom in the United States Courthouse.

This matter is before the court on motions to dismiss the superseding indictment against defendants LUTHER LANGFORD TAYLOR, LARRY BLANDING and BENJAMIN J. GORDON, JR., and the indictments against defendants PAUL WAYNE DERRICK and JEFFERSON MARION LONG, JR., on the grounds of prosecutorial, agency and/or investigative misconduct. Each defendant in these cases has joined in the motions of the other defendants. All of these defendants are back before this court for retrials on remand from the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. the motions, The court has reviewed each of the memorandums in support of and in opposition thereto, the transcripts of the various hearings, and the numerous exhibits attached to the memorandums and filed with the court in support of oral arguments. 1 The court is convinced that the totality of the government's actions in these matters rises to the level of egregious prosecutorial misconduct, and that this is a sufficient finding on which the court can exercise its supervisory power. A tedious analysis of the case law has not provided any clear standards or guidelines for the dismissal of indictments when the government has been found guilty of misconduct. It does appear to be clearly established that the dismissal of an indictment is a drastic step; however, the court believes it has the discretion under the doctrine of the court's supervisory power to dismiss should it find the government's actions so outrageous as to offend the sensibilities of the court. The government would argue that in using its supervisory power the court must find pattern and prejudice, and that the defendants have proven neither. The court agrees that the circuits are in disarray on this subject, but believes there is sufficient precedent to dismiss the subject indictments without addressing these issues. A fuller discussion *624 of its authority under the supervisory power doctrine will be found at the conclusion of this order. I have wrestled with some sanction short of dismissal, but find that the only remedy available to these defendants that would be commensurate with the misconduct of the government is in the dismissal of these indictments. I am of the opinion that the nature and breadth of its misconduct is indicative of the drastic steps the prosecution took to win these cases, and that the resultant injustice to these defendants cannot be fully remedied by new trials. Therefore, the court must take the equally drastic step of invoking its supervisory power to dismiss these indictments with prejudice. I. PROCEDURAL HISTORY These cases arise from an FBI investigation of drugs and corruption in the South Carolina State House, code-named OPERATION LOST TRUST, that eventually involved some twenty-eight State legislators, lobbyists and others. In early 1988, Special Agent Michael S. Clemens of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Columbia, South Carolina, office, commenced an investigation of drug violations by members of the South Carolina State Legislature. On April 28, 1989, a registered South Carolina lobbyist, Ronald L. Cobb, was apprehended by the FBI after attempting to invest in a drug deal with an undercover agent. When approached by Clemens and other FBI agents, Cobb, realizing he had been caught in the commission of a felony, told the agents he could help them with a far more serious problem political corruption in the State House. The FBI was in possession of some historical evidence of political corruption in the State House at that time, but had never developed sufficient evidence to indict any legislators or lobbyists. Cobb was given the opportunity to avoid prosecution for the drug deal in exchange for becoming a paid confidential informant. 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 2 \f U.S. v. Taylor, 956 F.Supp. 622 (1997) Over the next several months, the details of a sting operation were developed with Cobb's assistance. It was ultimately determined to utilize a pari-mutuel betting bill then before the legislature; to set Cobb up as the lobbyist for a bogus corporation known as The Alpha Group, and to have Cobb let it be known that he had funds available for those legislators who would assist him in the passage of this legislation. The resulting corruption charges of Conspiracy to Commit Extortion under Color of Official Right and Extortion under Color of Official Right against these and some of the other defendants were brought pursuant to the Hobbs Act, Title 18, United States Code Section 1951. Other defendants were indicted on drug charges pursuant to various sections of Title 21, United States Code. On August 24, 1990, the first of the criminal indictments, No. 3:90 339, was returned against defendant LUTHER LANGFORD TAYLOR, a member of the S.C. House of Representatives, charging him with one count of conspiracy to commit extortion and five substantive counts of extortion, and ROBERT ALFRED KOHN, also a member of the S.C. House, charging him in the conspiracy count. Kohn pled guilty on September 26, 1990. On September 19, 1990, Taylor 2 filed a motion to dismiss the indictment on the grounds of prosecutorial, agency and/ or investigative misconduct, which was heard and taken under advisement on September 24, 1990. A supporting memorandum was filed on October 1, 1990; the government filed its opposition on October 4th, and the motion was denied by this court on October 9, 1990. On October 15, 1990, the trial of Taylor commenced, and on October 25th he was found guilty on all six counts of the indictment. Taylor's post-trial motions were denied, and he was sentenced to seventy-eight months on each of the six counts, the said sentences to run concurrently. Taylor appealed his conviction. Bond pending appeal, vigorously opposed by the government, was denied. *625 During this time, on September 21, 1990, a six- count indictment, No. 3:90 434, was returned against Ennis Maurice Fant, Larry Blanding and Benjamin J. Gordon, also members of the State House of Representatives. These defendants, likewise, filed a joint motion to dismiss for prosecutorial misconduct on November 7, 1990, to which the government responded on November 15, 1990. The motion was denied at a hearing on November 19, 1990. Fant pled guilty to the conspiracy count of the indictment on February 22, 1991, and trial proceeded as to Blanding and Gordon on February 25, 1991. On the first day of trial Gordon filed another motion to dismiss for prosecutorial misconduct, which was denied. Guilty verdicts as to both defendants were returned on March 7, 1991. After two hearings, their motions for acquittal and new trial were denied on August 7, 1991. Blanding was sentenced the following month to thirty-seven months each on the conspiracy count and two substantive counts of extortion, said sentences to run concurrently, and remained on bond until he commenced serving his sentence upon designation by the Bureau of Prisons. Defendant Gordon's sentencing on one count of conspiracy and one substantive count of extortion was postponed as the result of contested legal issues relating to sentencing and, subsequently, the defendant's health. Both defendants appealed their convictions. Defendant Paul Wayne Derrick was indicted on February 20, 1991, by a two-count criminal indictment charging conspiracy to commit extortion and extortion under color of official right, # 3:91 0091, and went to trial on May 1, 1991. On May 11th he was found guilty on both counts and was sentenced to thirty-four months on each count, said sentences to run concurrently. Derrick appealed this conviction and has remained free on bond. Defendant Jefferson Marion Long, Jr. was a member of the South Carolina Senate who was indicted in a two-count Indictment, # 3:91 0394, charging conspiracy to commit extortion and extortion under color of official right, on August 20, 1991. Trial commenced on November 12th; his motion for a directed verdict was granted as to Count 1 on November 22nd, and the jury returned a guilty verdict as to Count 2 on November 23, 1991. On March 26, 1992, this court granted this defendant's motion for a new trial, which order was appealed by the government. Long has since remained free on bond. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals found that the jury charge given in the Taylor, Blanding and Gordon, and Derrick cases, to be in conflict with the subsequent holdings in McCormick v. United States, 500 U.S. 257, 111 S.Ct. 1807, 114 L.Ed.2d 307 (1991) (on the issue of quid pro quo), and Evans v. United States, 504 U.S. 255, 112 S.Ct. 1881, 119 L.Ed.2d 57 (1992) (on the issue of inducement), and remanded these three cases for re-trial. See, USA v. Taylor, 2015 Thomson Reuters.

In another unpublished opinion, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed this court's decision granting a new trial in USA v. Long, No. 92 6799; 1994 WL 56993 (4th Cir. Feb. 25, 1994). Following remand, both Taylor and Blanding were released on bond. This court then granted Gordon a new trial on August 6, 1993. 3 On July 1, 1993, this court issued an order for a statewide jury to be selected on August 16, 1993, in the retrial of Taylor. By order of August 2, 1993, trial was continued to November 8, 1993. On August 18, 1993, the government filed a Superseding Indictment which consolidated the Taylor case with the Gordon and Blanding case. Taylor filed on September 29, 1993, the motion now still pending before this court to dismiss the superseding indictment on grounds of double jeopardy, claiming prosecutorial and/or agency misconduct, which motion *626 the government opposed on October 6, 1993. On October 19, 1993, the trial of the three defendants was continued to December 6, 1993, principally due to Gordon's health. Again on October 26, 1993, the trial was continued to the first available term following January 1, 1994. On November 29, 1993, however, the defendants received volumes of discovery material not previously furnished them by the government. 4 As a result, Taylor filed several supplemental Brady motions, and on February 20, 1994, he filed a supplemental memorandum in further support of his dismissal motion. Gordon filed his motion to dismiss on February 22, 1994. 5 At this point, the United States Attorney for the District of South Carolina 6 sought an order of continuance and requested an investigation by the Department of Justice's Office of Professional Responsibility (DOJ/OPR). 7 On October 19, 1994, the U.S. Attorney for South Carolina recused his office from any further involvement in the cases, and attorneys from the Public Integrity Section of the Department of Justice were assigned as substitute counsel for the government. [1] On October 20, 1994, a status conference was held on the within cases. Each defendant joined in the motions of the others, and discovery was consolidated with regard to the motions only. The court established an Evidence Room wherein the government 8 was ordered to place all discovery materials and make them available to these defendants. 9 The defendants continued to file motions for additional discovery, and a hearing on Taylor's and Gordon's discovery motions filed March 15 and 17, 1995, was held in Columbia on April 19, 1995. This hearing resulted in the court issuing an order filed April 20, 1995, which stated in part: To avoid any further confusion as to what material should and should not be turned over by the government to the above defendants, it is ORDERED, that all documents and/or materials in possession of the government dealing with these cases and not presently available to the defendants in the evidence room be produced by the government directly to the court at Charleston, South Carolina, not later than Monday, May 8, 1995, for in camera inspection by the court.... [Order, 4/20/95, pp. 2 3]. inspection of Following an extensive the documents submitted to the court, the court *627 issued its order on July 25, 1995; and, following later submissions by the government, discovery orders were filed September 7 and October 6, 1995. On October 18 through 20, 1995, the court held another hearing in Columbia. At this hearing, additional government files came to light and the defendants argued with specificity for reconsideration of portions of the court's order of July 25, 1995. They further requested FBI computer-generated printouts of the inventories of the FBI's entire Lost Trust and Capital Gains 10 investigatory files, which resulted in Taylor filing an additional motion on January 19, 1996. Following a second lengthy in camera inspection by the court, and in response to Taylor's January 1996 motion, the court issued an order on February 6, 1996. At that time, the court ordered that the hearing held in recess since the previous October be reconvened on March 11, 1996, at which time all parties were to be prepared to present 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 4 \f U.S. v. Taylor, 956 F.Supp. 622 (1997) and complete testimony and arguments with regard to the motions to dismiss now pending before this court. The government subsequently moved on February 14, 1996, for reconsideration of the February 6th order, to which the defendant Taylor filed an objection, and the court ruled on this motion by order of February 23, 1996. The health of defendant Gordon continued to be an issue, and his counsel sought a continuance of the March 11, 1996, hearing date. The continuance was granted; however, on May 24, 1996, the court, following a telephone conference with all parties, conditionally severed the defendant Gordon 11 and reset oral arguments on the dismissal motions for May 29, 1996. On the day prior to that scheduled hearing, May 28th, the undersigned judicial officer suffered a heart attack and underwent angioplastic surgery on that date, and again on June 28th and August 19th. Thus, the hearing was not reconvened until October 3, 1996. Following a full day's hearing on October 3rd, the parties were given the opportunity to submit in writing any additional argument on matters in evidence on or before October 18th. The court received a letter under date of October 8, 1996, from the attorney for Taylor, and the government filed a memorandum on October 18, 1996, to which were attached Affidavits from former U.S. Attorney E. Bart Daniel, former Assistant U.S. Attorney Dale L. DuTremble, and Assistant U.S. Attorney John M. Barton, the chief prosecutors in these cases. 12 By letter under date of October 24, 1996, to the court, Derrick's attorney lodged a protest to the filing of the three Affidavits as an attempt by the government to add to the record after the close of the hearing, and the court ruled that the Affidavits would not be considered. The joint motions of the above defendants to dismiss the superseding indictment as to Taylor, Blanding and Gordon and the indictments as to Derrick and Long on the grounds of double jeopardy and prosecutorial, agency and/or investigative misconduct are now ready for a ruling by this court. II. DEFENDANTS' MOTIONS TO DISMISS Some three to four weeks prior to the commencement of his trial, Taylor filed his first motion to dismiss on the grounds of investigative agency and prosecutorial misconduct in which he charged (1) that the government's presentation to the Grand Jury was legally insufficient and exculpatory evidence was withheld, (2) that the conduct of the U.S. Attorney with regard to pretrial publicity had been improper, and (3) that the government engaged in fundamentally unfair investigative practices. Following a hearing and additional memorandums, this court denied his motion. [Order, 10/9/90]. Likewise, a joint motion was filed prior to trial by defendants Fant, Blanding and Gordon to dismiss for prosecutorial misconduct *628 or, in the alternative, for sanctions, on the grounds (1) that the government violated an order of the court concerning pre-trial publicity, and (2) that the government violated the Code of Federal Regulations governing the release of information in criminal actions by personnel of the Department of Justice. The motion was denied at a hearing on November 19, 1990. 13 On the day jury selection commenced in the Blanding/Gordon case, 14 February 25, 1991, the defendant Gordon filed a motion to dismiss for prosecutorial misconduct on the ground that Brady material furnished by the government only three days earlier 15 would show that the government's key witness had perjured himself both at the Taylor trial and before the Grand Jury and that the government had taken no steps to correct the matter. The motion was denied by this court at a hearing on March 1, 1991. The cases proceeded to trial, conviction, and remand on appeal. Prior to retrial, however, on September 29, 1993, Taylor filed a motion to dismiss on the grounds (1) that the government had withheld evidence both exculpatory in nature and favorable to Taylor in violation of the letter and spirit of the Brady case, and (2) that during the original trial proceedings the government generated extensive, prejudicial pre-trial publicity, thus denying defendant a fair trial in violation of the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. At a hearing on October 12, 1993, the court took the motion under advisement. On February 12, 1994, Taylor filed a supplemental memorandum which informed the court that he had received from the government under date of November 29, 1993, a substantial number of documents and tapes never seen before. In the memorandum, Taylor identifies recently received materials which he claims overwhelmingly establish the extent and scope of the government's violations of its responsibilities under Brady at the time of his first trial. He 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 5 \f U.S. v. Taylor, 956 F.Supp. 622 (1997) cites to specific pre-trial discovery sought via five Brady motions. Additionally, he claims that the theories of his defense were disclosed prior to trial so that the government cannot claim that it failed to see the exculpatory nature of the evidence sought but not disclosed; that defendant made an ample, if not overwhelming, record of his Brady requests; that rather than disclose the evidence it had which could be used to impeach its witnesses, the government sought to preclude the issue, and that during the trial defendant made further requests for Brady material to which the government attorneys made deceitful responses, thereby breaching their duty as officers of the court. On February 22, 1994, defendant Gordon filed his motion to dismiss the superseding indictment on the grounds (1) that the government intentionally withheld certain Brady material during his first trial, (2) that the government lied to the court about the existence of the Brady material, and (3) that the government allowed perjured testimony to be presented to the court. Derrick filed his motion claiming prosecutorial misconduct in the withholding of Brady materials on April 19, 1995, and supplemented this motion on September 5, 1995. Taylor filed a Second Supplemental Memorandum to his motion to dismiss on August 25, 1995, in which he expands his argument that the government was guilty of outrageous misconduct in that, among other things, it failed to supervise adequately a paid government informer, disregarded FBI regulations by questioning a target without Miranda warnings, delayed in transcribing interviews of witnesses, allowed false declarations before the Grand Jury and false testimony at trial which it did not correct, communicated with the defendant after trial without prior notice to his counsel, participated in prejudicial pretrial publicity, engaged in a pattern of conduct calculated to infringe on the Grand Jury's ability to exercise independent judgment; *629 misrepresented facts proven false by documents later found in the government's file, failed to present exculpatory evidence to the Grand Jury, withheld prior exculpatory testimony and misrepresented to the court and the defense that the prior testimony existed; tainted the proceedings by misrepresentations and indiscretions of government agents, failed to provide proper warning to a Grand Jury target prior to his testifying before the Grand Jury, and perjury by a government agent. A Third Supplemental Memorandum was filed by Taylor on March 28, 1996, following access to discovery materials furnished by direction of this court's order of February 6, 1996, as amended by order filed February 23, 1996. Taylor argues here that the new materials prove (1) that throughout this sting operation the government violated its own representations, the instructions it was required to follow, and the rules designed to insure fairness; (2) the perjury of Ron Cobb and Agent Clemens, as well as the false statements and arguments of the government attorneys, and (3) willful Brady violations. He further contends that this material contains new Brady material of which defendants had no prior knowledge. The defendants previously have taken issue with the handling of the investigation by the Department of Justice Office of Professional Responsibility (DOJ/OPR) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation Office of Professional Responsibility (FBI/OPR) after the OPR reports were furnished to the defendants in January of 1995. Taylor's letter submission of October 8, 1996, includes a summary of his allegations that the pattern of misconduct extends beyond the local FBI and U.S. Attorney's offices to a pattern of dissembling by FBI Headquarters and the Department of Justice as well. III. GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSES TO MOTIONS TO DISMISS The government responded on October 6, 1993, to Taylor's motion to dismiss of September 29, 1993. These documents were filed following remand but prior to recusal by the U.S. Attorney for the District of South Carolina and prior to the government furnishing additional discovery materials to the defendant on November 29, 1993. The government's response was prepared by AUSA Barton, who states therein: The United States not only vehemently denies these allegations but also maintains that even if true, neither the Fifth these allegations nor Amendment any basis the Superseding for dismissal of Indictment in this case. provide 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 6 \f U.S. v. Taylor, 956 F.Supp. 622 (1997) [Gov's. Response to Def. Taylor's Motion to Dismiss Indictment, 10/6/93, p. 1]. In its argument against the allegation of the suppression of exculpatory evidence being material to the outcome of the trial, the government states that the defendant Taylor failed to show that there was a reasonable probability that the result of the trial would have been different had the evidence been disclosed; and, further, that defendant did not make full use of the information available to him, and thus no Brady violation occurred. The government also argues that Taylor has abjectly failed to support his extensive, prejudicial publicity assertion. As to defendant's Fifth Amendment double jeopardy claim, the government relies on the finding in United States v. Borokinni, 748 F.2d 236 (4th Cir.1984), and concludes that, even if Taylor's alleged Brady violations were accurately stated and that the information was willfully withheld by the government, the Fifth Amendment's double jeopardy would not provide a basis for the dismissal of the indictment. Following the receipt by defendant of additional discovery on November 29, 1993, as mentioned above, Taylor filed a supplemental memorandum on February 10, 1994, and Gordon filed his motion to dismiss on February 22, 1994; the matter was referred to the DOJ/OPR for investigation and attorneys from the Public Integrity Section, Criminal Division, of the DOJ were substituted for the U.S. Attorney's Office in South Carolina. In opposition to both Taylor's and Gordon's motions and memorandums, an extensive memorandum was filed on the government's behalf on October 31, 1994, by Daniel J. Butler, Senior Trial Attorney, and other DOJ attorneys. *630 The Butler memorandum reiterates the government's previous argument that there has been no showing of intentional government misconduct or longstanding pattern of misconduct. The government argues that the defendants' contentions primarily relate to the non-production of two FBI FD 302s, 16 and cites to the Fourth Circuit's ruling in USA v. Taylor, 966 F.2d at 837, where the court, in response to the defendant's claim that the government did not produce all evidence bearing on witness Cobb's credibility, held that ... [Taylor] is now aware of this evidence and may use it as the Rules of Evidence may provide at his retrial. The government claims that other Brady violation claims by the defendants, such as Cobb's use of cocaine, witness Robert Kohn's 17 use and sale of cocaine, other video-and audio-tapes of Kohn and other taped interviews of co-conspirators, can also be remedied by a new trial. In response to other defense allegations, the government denies that there was any intentional misleading of the court or the defendant and no knowing presentation of perjured testimony. The government also makes its argument as to the requirement that the defendants must show prejudice, which it claims they have not done, and presents an argument against defendants' exclusive reliance on the case of United States v. Shafer, 987 F.2d 1054 (4th Cir.1993), for dismissal of the superseding indictment on double jeopardy grounds and against defendants' argument for dismissal based on the court's supervisory powers. Subsequent to the above filings and as a result of a hearing on October 20, 1994, the evidence room was established as of December 1, 1994, in which the government was directed to make all discovery available to the defendants. Numerous discovery disputes arose; the court conducted in camera inspections of documents which the government sought to have excluded, and another discovery hearing was held on April 19, 1995. Defendant Derrick then filed on that date his separate motion to dismiss. On August 25, 1995, Taylor filed his Second Supplemental Memorandum in which he detailed various other allegations of government misconduct he claims came to light only as a result of the additional discovery at his disposal. Derrick also filed a supplement to his motion on September 5, 1995. On September 25, 1995, the government responded to Taylor's August (Second Supplemental) memorandum. It summarizes Taylor's arguments for dismissal as (1) nondisclosure of Brady material, (2) misstatements to the court regarding the existence of discovery material, and (3) the knowing presentation of false testimony. It incorporates its earlier response that under either an outrageous' conduct theory or the Court's supervisory power, a motion to dismiss requires the defendant to prove both intentional governmental misconduct and demonstrable prejudice. [Footnote omitted]. Again, the government summarizes the defendants' contentions into three subject areas: (1) Taylor's response to the government's memorandum 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 7 \f U.S. v. Taylor, 956 F.Supp. 622 (1997) in opposition to the motions to dismiss; (2) the discovery produced since December 1, 1994, and (3) the capital gains tax matter. The government argues specifically with regard to defendant Taylor that, although he now has many more items of discovery which he did not have at his first trial, this is due in large part to the fact that he now has all of the Lost Trust discovery, whether it relates specifically to him or not. The government again argues that the remedy for a significant Brady violation is a new trial, not dismissal *631 of an indictment. As to Taylor's allegations of misstatements by the government to the court or the knowing use of false testimony, the government contends that defendant has completely failed to show bad faith on the part of the government and has not even begun to refute the conclusions of the Offices of Professional Responsibility ... for the Department of Justice ... and the FBI which failed to find merit in [his] allegations. The government also puts forth the argument here that defendant Taylor lacks standing to challenge the alleged misconduct in trials of other Lost Trust defendants and there is no longstanding pattern of government misconduct. In this memorandum the government also refutes Taylor's allegations as to various items of evidence he claims were withheld. These items will be dealt with with specificity later in this order. In its response to defendant Derrick's motion, the government also contends that this defendant has failed to show any intentional misconduct or a longstanding pattern of misconduct or any prejudice which would warrant dismissal of the indictment against him, and that any remedy to which he is entitled has been granted in his impending retrial. After Taylor filed his Second Supplemental Memorandum in August 1995, this court, in October 1995, held a three- day hearing, which resulted in a second extensive in camera inspection and orders filed February 6 and February 23, 1996. The oral arguments by defendants in October 1995 were sufficient to convince the court that the volumes of material that continued to surface and their possible significance to the defendants warranted the issuance of an order directing the government to grant access to the defendants to many documents previously denied to the defendants by the court. Upon review of these documents, Taylor filed his Third Supplemental Memorandum on March 28, 1996, to which the government responded on April 16, 1996. In its opposition, the government refers to its previous opposition briefs to show that Taylor has failed to carry his burden of proving any intentional government misconduct, let alone a longstanding pattern of misconduct.... Nor has the defendant demonstrated any prejudice to his rights that would affect the outcome of his retrial before this Court. Defendant's Memorandum merely cobbles together a voluminous stew of quotations from the government's administrative files together with unwarranted speculation and erroneous legal conclusions, all to support his theory that this Court should take the drastic and disfavored step of dismissing an indictment.

The government further responded to Taylor's argument that the new materials prove that throughout this sting operation the government violated its own representations, the instructions it was required to follow, and the rules designed to insure fairness by affirmatively stating that the government did not violate its internal policies and by citing to a disclaimer in the privately-published DOJ Manual to which the defendant's memorandum referred. It defends its use of the pari-mutuel betting bill for its sting operation and its payments to its primary witness, Ronald L. Cobb. As to defendant's charge of perjury by Cobb and SA Clemens, as well as false statements and arguments by government attorneys, the government argues that no document in the government's files, no document quoted by the defendants, and none of the recently disclosed materials prove that Cobb testified falsely, but only that the government agents and prosecutors did not agree with certain of his interpretations. In addition, as to the third general charge by defendants of willful Brady violations, the government again denies that any documents were willfully withheld or that the defendants are in any way prejudiced since the remedy of retrial is available. 18 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 8 \f U.S. v. Taylor, 956 F.Supp. 622 (1997) *632 In its Post Hearing Memorandum in Opposition to Defendants' Motions to Dismiss, filed October 18, 1996, the government, in addition to its legal arguments as to the defendants' burden of proof, sets out the general denial that there was no intentional effort by the government to withhold discovery; that the discovery errors were, at most, inadvertent and immaterial, and that the government did not intentionally mislead the court about discoverable materials. This memorandum also addresses the defendants' claims of government-sanctioned perjury by Cobb and misconduct in the investigation of the capital gains tax matter. It also touches on several other defense allegations as will be more fully shown hereafter. IV. THE OPEN FILE POLICY From the outset, these cases were to be tried under what is referred to in this district as an open file policy. During its tenure on the bench, this court has conducted numerous criminal trials under this policy and never before has its interpretation been so challenged as in the government's present arguments. As a lawyer and a judge, this court's experience has been that open file meant that the government's entire discovery file would be made available to the defendants for their examination. There are, of course, certain documents excluded from this policy under the government's internal administrative and work product privilege. It has long been established that when an open file policy is declared, the dictates of Brady and Giglio as well as Bills of Particular, become extraneous; all discovery material, except as limited to privileged work product, is made available to the defendants. This would have come as no surprise to USA Daniel or his assistants, most of whom had prosecuted cases before this court on numerous occasions. As shown above, motions to dismiss for prosecutorial misconduct had been filed by one or another of these defendants during the preparation and pendency of their original trials in 1990 and 1991. 19 One of the primary grounds on which those motions and the more recent motions are based is the willful withholding of Brady and other exculpatory material. The defendants have persisted in their allegations that the government had to be withholding evidence critical to their defense and specifically requested some of this evidence in their discovery motions. Where it felt appropriate, the court instructed the government to turn over requested materials, if they existed, to the defendant. But the government would respond by either declaring that disclosure or unredacting of the requested documents would jeopardize ongoing investigations or by affirmatively asserting, without any qualification, that it had complied with its discovery obligations. The existence of several specific documents sought by the defendants was denied in open court by the prosecutors and by SA Clemens under oath. V. DISCUSSION OF THE ISSUES The instant cases first came before the court over six years ago with the indictment of Taylor in August 1990. The evidence as it relates to the retrials of these defendants is in and of itself voluminous. Together with the additional materials that relate to the charges of prosecutorial misconduct, the record now before the court is so vast as to make it virtually impossible to cite to all of the allegations and counter-arguments in detail. The strongest arguments the defendants make as to the significance of the withholding of Brady materials and other exculpatory evidence are found in the arguments relating to several of the issues to be addressed by the court at this time. In addition, defendants' allegations of perjury by certain witnesses and the government's knowledge thereof, as well as alleged misrepresentations to the defendants, the Grand Jury and the court, rising to the level of fraud upon the court, as revealed by the post-remand disclosure of evidence, must also be addressed. 1. The Withholding of Evidence as to Cobb's Characterization of the Payments Made to Legislators. Cobb consistently testified that he considered the monies he gave four of these defendants *633 to be bribes. 20 These defendants have consistently argued that the monies they received were considered by them to be campaign contributions and contend that certain withheld 302s would have served to impeach Cobb's bribery testimony. On June 14, 1989, an FD 302 of a Cobb debriefing was prepared by SA Clemens. This 302, which was not turned over to the defendants until November 29, 1993, states on page 2: 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 9 \f U.S. v. Taylor, 956 F.Supp. 622 (1997) COBB related that in regards to giving money to State Legislators, he routinely gives two or three hundred dollars to some just to keep them friendly toward him.... COBB stated that TEE FERGUSON, CHARLES A. HARVIN, III and DONNA MOSS were among those who he would give money. COBB indicated this money was not paid for any specific return benefit other than having someone friendly to him on whom he could call. [Taylor's Supp.Memo, 2/10/94, Exh. 4, p. 2]. Again, on June 22, 1989, Clemens prepared another Cobb FD 302, which did not surface until the Derrick trial. This 302 states in pertinent part: RONALD L. COBB provided a 1989 South Carolina Legislative Manual in which he had checked off all those legislators to whom he had paid money. When asked if these were bribe type payments or campaign contributions COBB replied, That's a hard question to answer. COBB was then asked if those checked off were persons he had given two, three, or four hundred dollars to for no specific reason other than to maintain favorable contact with COBB. COBB indicated that this was the case, and indicated he would give the money to the legislator and that was it. If the individual then wanted to claim it as a campaign contribution and report it or just stick it in his pocket, that was of no concern to COBB. [Emphasis added]. [Taylor's Supp.Memo 2/10/94, Exh. 1] The names of each of the within defendants are shown as checked off in the Legislative Manual; however, the listing of names with check marks next to them includes the names of numerous other legislators who were never targeted or indicted by the government in the Lost Trust investigation. 21 On July 26, 1989, another Cobb FD 302 was prepared by Clemens and was only turned over to the defendants after the issuance of this court's November 8, 1994, order. The following information is contained therein: COBB was asked about the manner in which he would pay legislators several hundred dollars. COBB stated that this was sometimes accomplished with cash, and sometimes by check, either from his business or personal account. COBB advised that sometimes payments were made at official fund raisers and sometimes in a social setting as a token of appreciation for support on something. COBB stated that sometimes a legislator will drop a hint that money is tight and that they could use some cash. COBB *634 added that if it was someone who was friendly toward his interests he would take care of them with a few hundred dollars. COBB emphasized that he did not know and did not care how they handled or reported the money. COBB's sole interest was to gain friends and supporters of his interests. [Hearing, 10/18 20/95, Taylor Exh. 3]. This language from these three FD 302s is used by the FBI Columbia Office almost verbatim in its Undercover Operation Proposal (UCO) dated September 5, 1989 [Taylor's Third Supp. Memo, 3/28/96, Exh. 1, p. 13], seeking authorization for this undercover operation. The government, therefore, was totally familiar with the existence of these 302s, yet it did not turn them over to the defendants for use at trial. Reference in the above-quoted FD 302 of July 26, 1989, to payments being made to legislators sometimes by check, either from his business or personal account, prompted requests from the defendants for Cobb's financial records. At the final hearing on the instant motions on October 3, 1996, testimony was elicited on direct examination of Mrs. Rhonda Collins 22 that the defendants were furnished with the records of Cobb's business account Government Business Associates, Inc. in or about May 1995. She stated that copies of nine (9) checks payable to various legislators in amounts between $100 and $650 23 have been found in these records. Mrs. Collins further stated that the defendants had never been furnished copies of Cobb's personal financial records. The defendants argue that the nine checks in increments of $100 to $650 corroborate the information quoted above from the FD 302s of June 14, 1989, June 22, 1989, and July 26, 1989, and that this information would have served to refute Cobb's testimony at the trials that the payments he made to these defendants were definitely known by them to be bribes. [See Hearing Tr., 10/18 20/95, pp. 56 66]. In its Post Remand Memorandum, the government argues that the financial records of Government Business Associates 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 10 \f U.S. v. Taylor, 956 F.Supp. 622 (1997) were submitted to the court for in camera inspection and that the court's order of July 25, 1995, held that the government need not provide these records to the defendants, but that upon resubmission the court ordered that the records be provided to the defendants on September 7, 1995. It is the government's contention that this reflects the less than clear nature of the discoverability of certain documents in this matter, especially these checks. A reading of this court's September 7th order, however, simply shows an admission by the court that it did not properly identify the photostatic copies of bank statements and canceled checks on this account in the first in camera submission of eleven file boxes of material under review. More importantly, however, the question is not why these records were not furnished in 1994 or 1995, but why they were not furnished to the defendants prior to their initial trials in 1990 and 1991. In addition to the above, defendants cite to the withholding of 302s on James Faber, Frank Earl McBride, and Ennis Maurice Fant, all dated July 18, 1990, in which each of them stated they believed the monies they received from Cobb to be campaign contributions. [Taylor's Motion to Dismiss, 9/23/93, Exhs. 13 15]. These 302s were derived from interviews conducted by the FBI simultaneously with the FBI's initial interview of defendant Taylor. 24 All four of these defendants *635 (Taylor, Faber, McBride and Fant), as well as others, were approached in a sweep by the FBI of targets of the Lost Trust investigation and must have been considered all part of the same case. Even had the defendants not been able to utilize these 302s at trial as statements of unavailable witnesses, as argued by the government in its Post Hearing Memorandum, it is the opinion of the court that these 302s should have been provided as relevant discovery material. Cobb testified that after he had been set up by the FBI as a lobbyist for the bogus Alpha Group in order to catch legislators accepting bribes for their support of the pari- mutuel bill, he sought the help of defendant Taylor in recruiting black legislators and the help of Kohn in recruiting white legislators. Taylor argues in his memorandum of February 10, 1994, that taped conversations between Cobb and Kohn go to the vital issue of whether or not the government was running a sting to catch crooked legislators or whether, on the other hand, Cobb was trying to make it appear that he could buy votes from legislators other than Senator Lindsay in an effort to save himself from the consequences of numerous illegal acts for which he could be prosecuted. [Taylor's Supp. Memo, 2/10/94, p. 9]. Taylor was a co-sponsor of the pending pari-mutuel bill and sat on both the Labor, Commerce & Industry Committee of the House of Representatives and the Banking and Consumer Affairs Sub Committee. Prior to the institution of the sting operation, the pari-mutuel bill had successfully passed these committees. Taylor contends that his continued support of the bill was not an explicit quid pro quo. He argues that this is corroborated on a tape recorded conversation of January 16, 1990 (Tape # 14), on which Kohn is heard to remark: ... we got the thing out of committee with no one doing anything..... No money, and you know, just, just doin' for the issue. [Taylor's Supp. Memo, 2/10/94, Exh. 9, p. 2]. Taylor further argues that this same tape shows that, in spite of FBI instructions to Cobb to be explicit about the quid pro quo aspect of his payments to legislators, Cobb felt the need to be far more subtle in his approach. In encouraging Kohn to bring supporters to him, Cobb instructed Kohn: You know how to, I mean you know how to work it and cover us, I mean, we don't want come over there and say well, here, they're gonna buy the damn thing. [Id. at p. 4] On an audio tape of April 5, 1990 (Tape # 75), Kohn tells Cobb: (UI)I'm not trying to hold back, I mean I realize (UI) I ain't trying to play that game. (UI)I've been asked for gold coins. If it doesn't look like money should be brought up, I don't do it to hold back money, I just don't think it's good to bring it up (UI). I use (UI) some of them I just casual comment about a contribution to their campaign cause see if you have to do that I can write a check and tell them I think their [sic] a good spirited citizen (UI). 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 11 \f U.S. v. Taylor, 956 F.Supp. 622 (1997) [Id., Exh. 12, p. 13]. The transcript of this tape is made a part of an FD 302, which states that this audiotape is of a telephone conversation Cobb has with a Wade Ronnie Crow, 25 followed by a meeting with Faber, McBride, Kohn, Taylor and one Rachel Harper. Taylor is shown to speak only once, and it is impossible for the court to ascertain whether he was present at the time the above statement was made by Kohn. His name, however, does appear in the cover *636 FD 302, yet he was not furnished this tape or the FD 302 and transcription prior to his trial. These tapes, as well as the numerous other audio and video tapes furnished to the defendants on November 29, 1993, certainly must be viewed as exculpatory evidence which could have been used to further the defense put forth by these defendants that they considered the monies they received from Cobb to be campaign contributions. In this order the court cites allegations primarily from the arguments, memorandums and exhibits of defendants Taylor, Blanding and Gordon. In fact, with regard to the timing of their trials and evidence not furnished to them for their defenses, their positions are closely related. Derrick was the defendant in the third Lost Trust trial, and some, although by no means all, of the previously withheld evidence was available to him and defendant Long for their trials. 26 Defendant Derrick also presented additional testimony at his trial that the monies he received from Cobb were used to produce a semi-annual newsletter to his constituents. The government objected to the admission into evidence of a copy of the newsletter he had published in the spring prior to his indictment on the grounds that it had never received a copy of that newsletter, that it was hearsay, and that it was irrelevant. Paul Derrick affirmatively stated at trial that he had given a copy to the government. At a hearing on April 19, 1995, Derrick disclosed that we have just recently discovered in the most recent documents an FBI 302. Guess what is attached to it? That news letter. They had it.... We didn't get to get that in during the trial. [Hearing Tr., 4/19/95, p. 37]. Defendant Long is presently before this court for a new trial granted him by this court, which decision was upheld on appeal. At the conclusion of the Long trial, this court dismissed one count against Long; however, tapes ruled pertinent only to the dismissed count inadvertently had been allowed to go to the jury room. Long, however, has joined in the motions for dismissal on the grounds of prosecutorial misconduct as the motions may relate to him. 27 At the motions' hearing in October 1995, Long cross- examined Cobb concerning his testimony at Long's trial that when Cobb gave Long the money in question in this case, Long had no idea that it was a bribe. The transcript from October 19, 1995, reads: Q. That he would have thought that you were simply helping him out of his financial difficulties, and it was not related to any legislation pending in the South Carolina Legislature; is that correct? A. That's correct, yes, sir. Q. Specifically the pari-mutuel bill? A. Yes, sir. Q. And the pari-mutuel bill, as a matter of fact, was something that Bud Long had always supported; is that correct? A. Yes, sir. Q. As I understand it, it is your position that Bud Long never had the intent to accept a bribe? A. That's correct. Q. And that you led him to believe, or did not lead him to believe other than it was just some money from a friend to help him out of his financial difficulties? A. He was in a tight, [sic] and he had been very valuable in assisting me in getting clients, and I had given Bud money from time to time, and he could very easily have thought that this was one of those situations. As a matter of fact, I think he even told me to make sure I think he may have looked at it as a contribution, because he told me one time to make sure that I thank my people for the contribution. *637 .... 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 12 \f U.S. v. Taylor, 956 F.Supp. 622 (1997) Q. Now, let me ask you this, which I was not able to ask at the trial, because I did not know about that until the trial, prior to the meeting ever being arranged or your discussion with Bud Long concerning this money, did you communicate to the F.B.I. that it was unfair to put Bud Long in that position, because of, number one, his financial difficulties; and, number two, because of your unique relationship with him, he would not understand and not realize it was a bribe? A. Yes, sir, I did; also, to the U.S. Attorney's Office. Q. This is prior to it ever coming about? A. That's correct. [Hearing Tr., 10/19/95, Vol. II, pp. 32 3]. Cobb further testified that in the time frame prior to the exchange of money with Long, he voiced the same concern to AUSA Alfred W. (Buddy) Bethea, SA Clemens, USA Daniel, and AUSA Barton; but, in spite of his protestations on more than one occasion, SA Clemens instructed him to go ahead and meet with Long. [Id. at p. 34]. He further testified that he repeatedly told AUSA Bethea, who was to be the lead prosecutor for the Long trial, that Long would have had no reason to believe that the money he was accepting from Cobb was bribe money. When asked for AUSA Bethea's reaction, he stated: His reaction was one of he had made up his mind that Bud Long was guilty, he wanted to try him, he hadn't participated in any of the trials, and he was more gung ho, I think, about trying the case than anything else. We had a very strong disagreement in this regard. [Id. at pp. 40 1]. When Cobb testified to the above on direct examination by AUSA John W. McIntosh at Long's trial, McIntosh personally refused to proceed with the prosecution; and USA Daniel, who had not been part of the trial prosecution team, replaced him for the balance of the trial. 2. The Capital Gains Tax Investigation and Ronald L. Cobb. Cobb has been previously identified in this order as the government's key confidential informant employed in the sting operation. Cobb was a former member of the South Carolina State Legislature and a licensed lobbyist. He maintained throughout these cases that he was a close personal friend of Lindsay, who was undisputedly one of the most powerful men in State government. Lindsay was a member of the Senate Conference Committee appointed to negotiate the differences between the Senate and House versions of the 1988 Appropriations Bill, in which a capital gains tax rollback provision had been included as a proviso. Prior to his trial, Taylor had received a substantially redacted FD 302 of an interview of lobbyist J. Randal Lee by SA Clemens and SA Thomas J. Davis conducted August 14 21, 1990. [Hearing, 10/18 20/95, Gordon Exh. G]. Taylor argued that he was entitled to place Cobb's credibility before the jury and that to do so he would need to review documents he believed to be in the government's possession, and to be furnished the identity, which had been redacted from the documents furnished, of various elected officials to whom Cobb had made payoffs. A transcript of a pre-trial motions hearing on October 11, 1990, reveals Taylor's argument that nothing is more relevant to this whole case than the credibility of Mr. Ron Cobb. [Hearing Tr., 10/11/90, pp. 37 42]. Apparently, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals agrees. 28 Some six days prior to the Blanding/Gordon trial, the government turned over to those defendants the unredacted FD 302 dated August 14 21, 1990 [Taylor's Supp.Memo, 2/10/94, Exh. 7], which disclosed that Lindsay's name had been redacted in the version furnished Taylor. This 302 discusses *638 at length the South Carolina Capital Gains Tax bill initiated in 1988 (the proviso ), and puts the government on notice of alleged bribe payment arrangements involving Richard E. Greer, Chairman of the South Carolina State Development Board, Lindsay, Cobb, and various other persons. Also during the Blanding/Gordon trial, on February 22, 1991, as the result of a court order of February 14, 1991, the government furnished the Blanding/Gordon defendants with 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 13 \f U.S. v. Taylor, 956 F.Supp. 622 (1997) an unredacted FD 302 of an interview of Cobb by FBI SA Arthur Richards dated May 1, 1989, which revealed Lindsay's involvement in payoffs regarding legislation known as the Oil Jobbers bill. At a hearing on Blanding and Gordon's motions to dismiss for prosecutorial misconduct filed on February 25, 1991, and heard February 28, 1991, Richards confirmed under oath Cobb's understanding that the debriefing on May 1, 1989, concerned payoffs and kickbacks and extortion. We were talking about payoffs. [Gordon's Motion to Dismiss, 2/22/93, Exh. C, p. 120]. Richards testified that he debriefed Cobb prior to and after he administered a polygraph examination. On direct examination by Gordon, Richards related that Cobb initially failed the polygraph test he was administering to him concerning the Oil Jobbers bill, testifying as follows: A. .... He [Cobb] said that through an intermediary, that he initially would not identify, he paid Representative Mangum [sic] 29 $10,000 in order to get his vote. That was the first issue that I polygraphed. Q. Okay. Now the issue that you polygraphed him on was whether or not he in fact paid representative Mangum the $10,000 through the intermediary. A. That's correct. Q. All right, sir. And he tested truthful on that? A. He did not. He failed that polygraph examination. Q. What happened after that? A. Then after he failed it, he was confronted with the fact that he had failed it. And he said that he had that there was another person involved, this intermediary, and that that intermediary also got some money. But he would not at that point, without certain assurances, would not disclose the identity of the intermediary. .... Q. And because he hadn't divulged to you that there was another party involved, Senator Lindsay A. Exactly. Q. he showed deception? A. He showed deception. At that point, I put him on the telephone with Agent Clemens, and together they worked out an arrangement where the government, if he gave us the identity of the intermediary, where the government would not use his statement against that intermediary,.... .... A. Okay. After it was worked out and it was agreeable to Agent Clemens and agreeable to Mr. Cobb, at that point he wrote down Jack Lindsay on a sheet of paper. I'm talking about Mr. Cobb showed it to me, and then crumpled the piece of paper up and threw it in the trash can. .... Q. And when you tested him about the payoff to Representative Mangum, after he divulged to you that Senator Lindsay was the intermediary, how did Mr. Cobb do? A. He passed the second test. [Id. at pp. 111 19]. This testimony alone refutes the government's argument that Cobb has consistently adhered to his subjective view of the facts during the investigation ... [Gov's Post Hearing Memo, 10/18/96, p. 23], and that the defendants do not and cannot show perjury by Cobb as to his subjective beliefs, ... [Id. at p. 26]. At this same hearing on February 28, 1991, Gordon furthered the argument that, if the government had any 302 regarding Cobb's payoffs to Lindsay, the defendants were entitled to know if they have talked to *639 Mr. Cobb and he's indicated these illegal payoffs. To this, the government replied: ... if he's looking for the secret 302 of Ron Cobb where this is discussed, it does not exist. There is no such 302 concerning that.... But there are no 302's or statements from Cobb concerning this particular instance involving capital gains tax. [Id. at p. 11 2]. At this hearing, SA Clemens was also examined under oath by Gordon as to the existence of any FD 302s Clemens might have prepared concerning Cobb's involvement with capital gains. The record reads as follows: 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 14 \f U.S. v. Taylor, 956 F.Supp. 622 (1997) Q. Mr. Clemens, I know you said you only briefly discussed it, but apparently y'all had some discussion about Ron Cobb's involvement with the capital gains tax legislation. Did you do a 302 or anything concerning that debriefing of Mr. Cobb? A. No. Q. Do you have any rough notes of it? A. No.... [Id., Exh. D, p. 36 7]. Mr. Barton concluded on this subject with the statement: There are three 302's and two volumes of Grand Jury testimony, that is the only thing that the government has from Mr. Cobb. [Id., Exh. C, p. 18]. As mentioned elsewhere in this order, copies of checks from Cobb's business account payable to Lindsay were also in possession of the government, but they were not furnished to the defendants at that time. Although Cobb testified that he sometimes wrote checks to legislators from his personal account, there is no evidence the government ever sought to obtain these records. On November 29, 1993, following remand of these cases for retrial, the government furnished for the first time an FD 302 of an interview of Cobb by SA Clemens dated September 25, 1989, in which the payments to Lindsay by Cobb with regard to the capital gains tax bill were characterized as payoffs. This is the secret FD 302 that's existence was previously denied by the government. This 302 was found by defendants in the November 29, 1993, discovery in a file marked KOHN 1 and is one of the two undisclosed 302s on which the Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) Report focused. The defendants take the position that SA Clemens' testimony that he had never prepared such a 302 was perjury and that the prosecutors were fully aware of the existence of that 302 and allowed the testimony to stand. SA Clemens explained to OPR investigators that he forgot it ever existed , calling it a garbage 302, [Hearing, 4/19/95, Defs. Exh. 45, pp. 32 3] and the government argues that this testimony should be excused inasmuch as this was Mr. Clemens' first time to testify at a trial. This is refuted by the defendants' argument that every witness is expected to tell the truth, regardless of whether or not it is their first time to testify. 30 During the OPR investigation, it was disclosed that rough notes of the interview which led to the 302 of September 25, 1989, had been taken by SA Clemens to his home in the Washington, D.C., area when he was promoted and transferred to FBI Headquarters from Columbia, S.C. 31 These notes were eventually provided by Clemens to the OPR in 1994 during its investigation. For this and several other infractions of FBI regulations, SA Clemens received a letter of censure, a five-calendar-day suspension, and six months' probation. At the Taylor trial, Cobb was asked on cross-examination: Mr. Cobb, I want you to tell me right now whether or not you have ever given bribes or illegal money to Senator Lindsay? Answer: No, sir, I have not given Senator Lindsay any bribes or illegal money. [Taylor Trial Tr., Vol. 3, p. 56]. The defendants argue that the government knew at that point in time that Cobb was *640 committing perjury and they allowed this perjurious testimony to stand and to continue throughout the subsequent trials. The government responds that, although it may have believed the payments of monies by Cobb to Lindsay were illegal, that Cobb's testimony could not be considered perjury because Cobb, himself, did not believe the monies to be illegal. The evidence now shows, however, that Cobb not only discussed payoffs in connection with the capital gains tax bill with SA Clemens, with Greer, and in the presence of Randy Lee, all of whom knew that the Cobb payments to Lindsay were, in fact, illegal, but he admitted to SA Richards on May 1, 1989, that he paid $20,000 in illegal monies to Lindsay and Magnum for their influence in passing the oil jobbers bill. Also in the record is a sworn Affidavit from SA Ronald L. Dick, who acted as the supervising agent at FBI Columbia for much of this investigation, which affirms defendants allegations that the government was totally aware of the nature of the Cobb payments to Lindsay. In his Affidavit, Dick states: 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 15 \f U.S. v. Taylor, 956 F.Supp. 622 (1997) I recall the subject of the capital gains tax bill. My recollection is that there were other cooperating witnesses who were providing information regarding this issue. However, Cobb would never allow the payments Cobb made to state senator Jack Lindsay to be characterized as bribes. My position on this matter was similar to the old saying that if it walks like a duck, talks like a duck, and looks like a duck, then it must be a duck. After listening to Cobb try to characterize the payments made to Lindsay as anything other than bribery, I remain unconvinced. As an FBI agent, it was clear to me that the monies paid to Lindsay by Cobb were in violation of the Hobbs Act. Cobb, however, would never allow these transactions to be characterized as bribes. This was the subject of much discussion between SSA Clemens, myself and the USAO Office. [Dick Affidavit to DOJ/OPR, 7/12/94]. A review of the UCO for the Lost Trust sting operation, then code-named Phaedrus, prepared by FBI Columbia in September 1989 [Taylor's Third Supp.Memo, 3/28/96, Exh. 1, p. 10], reflects that almost the identical wording was used in the UCO as that in SA Richards' FD 302 of May 1, 1989. [Hearing, 10/18 20/95, Taylor Exh. 2]. The names of both then-Supervising Agent in Charge James F. Denton, III, and SA Clemens appear on the Airtel which transmitted the UCO to FBI Headquarters. The government maintains that it was absolutely necessary to redact Lindsay's name from both SA Richard's FD 302 of May 1, 1989, and from Randy Lee's FD 302 of August 14 21, 1990, to protect an on-going investigation. However, it is difficult to reconcile this reasoning with SA Clemens' interpretation that Cobb's reference to pay- offs to Lindsay were part of a garbage 302 or with the testimony of SA Dick. Furthermore, the FBI relied in part on this information for authority to instigate the entire sting operation. The court simply cannot disregard Lindsay's prominent position in the politics of South Carolina and the obvious importance to both the FBI and the AUSO of information that he was involved in corruption. The explosive nature of that information, as well as information that Rogers, the Speaker of the House, and Greer, the Chairman of the State Development Board and, undisputedly, a close friend of Governor Carroll A. Campbell, Jr., were also involved, is revealed in an August 28, 1990, teletype sent from FBI Columbia to FBI Headquarters which requested authority for lobbyist Randy Lee to utilize electronic recording devices to monitor anticipated conversations with Greer. Greer, Lindsay and Rogers are the captioned subjects. That teletype reads in part: This request will require DOJ authority as sensitive circumstances exist in that captioned subjects are members of the South Carolina Legislature and high ranking State government employees. Three CWs hereafter referred to as CW 1 [Lobbyist Lee], CW 2 [Senator Lee] and CW 3 [Cobb] have provided information that bribe payments were made to South Carolina State Representatives John Irby Rogers, III, and South Carolina State Senator *641 John Charles Lindsay, in order to ensure the passage of certain capital gains tax legislation in the State of S.C. during the 1988 1989 legislative session. .... AUSA John Barton is aware of the facts of this case and fully concurs with the use of consensual monitoring. Entrapment is not an issue based upon the facts obtained thusfar [sic]. [Hearing, 10/18 20/95, Gordon Exh. T]. These were big fish, yet on February 28, 1990, Clemens testified concerning debriefings of Cobb about the capital gains tax matter that he had only talked to him for a short period of time to get a general general idea of what had gone on. [Gordon's Motion to Dismiss, 2/22/90, Exh. D, p. 37]. AUSA Barton was handling the discovery for the Taylor trial, and any 302 mentioning any one of these three subjects would certainly have been noticed by him, yet he denied the existence of the secret 302. At the Taylor pretrial hearing on October 11, 1990, and, in fact, at the subsequent hearings and trials in the entire Lost 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 16 \f U.S. v. Taylor, 956 F.Supp. 622 (1997) Trust matter, the court relied on the repeated representations by the government as officers of the court, that all the discovery to which the defendants were entitled had been turned over to them. The court is shown to have advised Taylor at his pretrial hearing: Well, based on what Mr. DuTremble tells the court, you know, I don't know that they have anything else to give you, sir. [Taylor Trial Tr., p. 54]. The court then stated: them answers [the United States ... when he [Brady Attorney] motion requests], and he's an attorney, signs his name down there, you know, just because he is a United States attorney, doesn't stop him from being an attorney, then I accept that just like I do any other attorney's signature. And they know what the ramifications are if they don't done in accordance . [Id. at p. 59] Just prior to Cobb's testimony at the Taylor trial, Taylor received a copy of Cobb's agreement with the FBI, the USAO, and the Office of the Attorney General of South Carolina. Taylor renewed his Brady motion that he be provided the actual details of all the crimes for which Mr. Cobb had been immunized under this agreement. The court, assuming that the government had disclosed all it had a duty to disclose, addressed Taylor's counsel as follows: ... you know as much about the government's case as the government knows. Supposedly they have given you everything they have short of which they have not told you which witnesses they are going to call and what have you. Other than that, you have everything they have. I just don't know what it is you think I can do about it. [Id. at p. 9]. Taylor, at this point in time, however, had none of the government's evidence of Cobb's pay-offs to Lindsay. At the February 28, 1991, hearing, after AUSA Barton's denial of the existence of the secret 302, the court admonished: ... all I can do is take them at their word, because they have always performed like most officers of the court do.... And Mr. Barton just said there are no 302's dealing with these matters which you talk about. And we are all aware that there are all kinds of ongoing investigations, and I'm sure if they already had them, he would have them and he would at least tell me that he had them and give them to me to look at and see if I thought he ought to have to give them to you. [Gordon's Motion to Dismiss, 2/22/93, p. 14]. Later in that same hearing, the court stated: I have already told them to give you everything they have, and I don't know how I can do better than that. Now, if you find out they didn't give you what they had, then I will take appropriate steps there. .... Mr. Barton has been trying to tell us from the time we got started, kept standing up and I kept sitting him down, and then I was confident he was going to say, We have given them everything we have, and *642 that is what he eventually said. [Emphasis added]. [Id. at p. 17]. Although the record will reflect that other questionable government conduct surfaced with regard to the handling of the Lindsay matter, the government's problems with Lindsay's involvement were mooted by his death. Rogers eventually pled. The record as to Greer, however, must be addressed. 3. The Capital Gains Tax Investigation and Richard E. Greer. Greer was initially implicated in the Lost Trust investigation by the August 1989 FD 302 of lobbyist Randy Lee. Lee's FD 302, which resulted from interviews conducted by the FBI on August 14 through 21, 1990, reads in pertinent part as follows: 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 17 \f U.S. v. Taylor, 956 F.Supp. 622 (1997) LEE stated he recalled GREER saying It is very big, it is important to a lot of people it would help a lot of the Governor's friends. Lee stated that as the conversation continued, it became obvious to him that GREER had arranged for several wealthy individuals, who were staunch supporters of Governor CARROLL CAMPBELL, to invest a large amount of money to affect the rollback. LEE stated the money to be invested by several of the participants, arranged by GREER, would be paid as a bribe to insure that the rollback would take place.... LEE stated he learned that ROE, BRASIER and possibly a third party, had been quoted a fee of seventy-five thousand dollars each, by GREER. LEE stated he either heard GREER mention this amount during the initial conversation, or at a later date; however, it was later explained to him by COBB. LEE stated he has never been certain whether or not the third unidentified individual was to pay a particular sum of money; however, he was certain that GREER had arranged for COBB and Senator JACK LINDSEY [sic] to receive one hundred fifty thousand dollars from ROE and BRASIER in the event they were able to affect the rollback of the Legislation, which was disguised as a proviso within the Appropriations Bill. [Taylor's Supp.Memo, 2/10/94, Exh. 7]. It is undisputed that USA Daniel and possibly SA Clemens, met with Greer and his attorney in Charleston, S.C., sometime in December of 1990. The defendants made repeated inquiries concerning the existence of a 302 or rough notes of this meeting. In its memorandum of October 18, 1996, the government reiterates that no such 302 exists and contends that the circumstances of that meeting suggest that no 302 would have been done. [Gov's. Post Hearing Memo, 10/18/96, p. 35]. What the memorandum does not address, however, is Greer's testimony that he was interviewed numerous or, at least, several times [Hearing Tr., 10/20/95, Vol. III, p. 342]. Although his testimony of the precise number of interviews, the time frame of each, and the place of each interview was never made completely clear, Greer stated that on at least two occasions subsequent to the initial meeting he was interrogated extensively by the FBI for several hours. Id. at pp. 362 6. A 302 of one interview with Greer in April 1991 dealing exclusively with his drug usage was furnished the defendants in discovery. If Greer testified truthfully that at one or more of these interviews he discussed the capital gains tax issue and his willingness to testify against Lindsay, then it would appear to the court that at least one 302 should have been prepared in connection with capital gains. Greer pled guilty to a drug charge and was sentenced by this court in July of 1991. At his sentencing hearing, the government argued for a downward departure from Greer's sentencing guidelines; and SA Davis, in the presence of USA Daniel and AUSA Barton, stated to the court: Your Honor, last Christmas, the FBI approached Dick Greer for the first time in connection with our drug investigation of Mr. Greer. This was prior to the Jack Rogers indictment. At that time Mr. Greer provided us with information concerning the capital gains tax investigation. Mr. Greer essentially told us that Lobbyist Ron Cobb had approached him and told him that he needed more money to pay off *643 both Jack Rogers and Senator Jack Lindsay in connection with the capital gains tax bill. He told us this is the first time that he knew that Ron Cobb that what he was doing was illegal. Mr. Greer was willing to testify against Mr. Rogers should he have been brought to trial and was in fact scheduled to testify against Mr. Rogers. Also Mr. Greer was willing and scheduled to testify against Senator Jack Lindsay in connection with this investigation. I think the investigation certainly would have resulted in an indictment should Mr. Lindsay have lived. [Hearing, 10/18 20/95, Gordon Exh. M, p. 13]. AUSA Barton informed the court at that same hearing: ... we were able to bring the people in there and determine that other than Ron Cobb, Jack Lindsay and Jack Rogers, there was no illegality with any piece of capital gains legislation. That illegality was only applicable to the retroactive affect of capital gains and had nothing to do with what the governor's number one priority of the Legislature was, changing the perspective (sic) capital gains rate. We find other than, as I described to you, Cobb, Lindsay and Rogers, we find no corruption, no undue improper 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 18 \f U.S. v. Taylor, 956 F.Supp. 622 (1997) influence, no money changing hands with regard to any of the capital gains bills. [Id. at p. 11]. During the arguments for a downward departure for Greer, it became apparent that this court was poised to deny the motion, and AUSA Barton requested an in camera hearing to furnish the court with additional information. It was at this in camera proceeding that USA Daniel and AUSA Barton presented, in some 16 pages of transcript [Id., Exh. L, pp. 34 49], the argument to the court that Greer had been of invaluable assistance to the government in explaining that two capital gains tax bills were before the Legislature, a retrospective or rollback capital gains tax bill and a prospective capital gains tax bill; that Greer had clarified the difference between the two, and that it was the passage of the prospective bill in which the Governor and his staff were actively engaged. USA Daniel and AUSA Barton informed the court that the information given the government by Randy Lee had been misleading and that it was Greer who was able to put the government investigation on the proper course that led the government to close its investigation on capital gains. In this regard, it is interesting to note that SA Davis, who, with SA Clemens, was present at the December 1990 meeting, told the OPR investigators that the first time he and Clemens ever heard this explanation of the prospective bill was at the Greer sentencing. Davis and Clemens were the two FBI agents most involved in the Lost Trust investigation. The defendants allege that Greer perjured himself before the Grand Jury and in the presence of USA Daniel. In the interim between the Christmas 1990 meeting with Greer and his sentencing hearing in July 1991, Greer testified on May 23, 1991, before the Grand Jury; and, in response to inquiry from AUSA Barton, he testified: Q. Were you aware of any monies paid to any legislators in [an] effort to influence their vote in connection with the capital gains rollback bill? A. No. Q. How about in connection with the Governor's change, the bill that was his priority? A. Absolutely not. [Id., Exh. K, pp. 14 5]. It is obvious from the government's argument for a downward departure for Greer that Greer had knowledge as early as December of 1990 that payoffs had been made by Cobb to Lindsay and Rogers. USA Daniel, who was present at the Christmas 1990 meeting, and who was, or should have been, privy to information given at other debriefings of Greer, was also present when AUSA Barton questioned Greer before the Grand Jury. Daniel did nothing to correct Greer's testimony that he was not aware of any illegal payoffs to legislators. AUSA Barton, in his interview with the OPR, provides the speculation as to why Greer responded as he did to the subject question before the Grand Jury. He opines that Greer might have felt justified in a negative response to the wording *644 Were you aware ..., whereas a positive response would have been forthcoming to the question had it been phrased Are you aware.... Greer's later statements in the record would tend to confirm that suggestion. This play with semantics, however, appears to the court to be totally without merit. In spite of the government's reliance at Greer's sentencing on the information given by Greer, no notes or FD 302s or written memorandums of any kind have surfaced of any debriefings of Greer with regard to capital gains. Also, in its in camera argument for Greer's downward departure motion, the government asserts that it was Greer who provided the names of those persons who could testify before the Grand Jury in support of Greer's version of the capital gains tax bills. The government states in its October 18, 1996, memorandum that the evidence showed that the government actively pursued the three identified subjects of that investigation [capital gains]: Dick Greer, Lindsay and Jack Rogers. [Gov.'s Post Hearing Memo, 10/18/96, p. 27]. The court disagrees. Greer, himself, was never polygraphed and no FD 302s or other written memorandums exist. The government further affirmatively states that Greer did not receive money in connection with capital gains legislation. [Id. at p. 28]. There is nothing is the record to show that the government's active pursuit of Greer included a review of Greer's financial records. It appears that the government simply accepted Greer's version of events and characterized the information given by Randy Lee as speculative and misleading. Although at the Greer sentencing hearing it was indicated that the government was misled about the 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 19 \f U.S. v. Taylor, 956 F.Supp. 622 (1997) capital gains matter by this information, Randy Lee was the beneficiary of a downward departure motion by the government at his sentencing hearing on January 13, 1992, based on his substantial assistance to the government. The court has difficulty in reconciling the government's position that Mr. Greer's substantial assistance served to correct its misconception about the capital gains tax bills and allowed it to put the capital gains tax investigation to rest with its position that Randy Lee provided them with substantial assistance, when it now claims Lee misled them into a lengthy and expensive investigation. 32 Further, at the sentencing of Lost Trust defendant Senator William Richard Lee on December 3, 1990, the government requested an in camera hearing for its argument in support of its downward departure motion. At that time, AUSA Barton stated: Your Honor, specifically after Mr. Lee gave us those revelations about the push that was put on we started looking at some of the individuals who we had some suspicion about and specifically I would anticipate the government seeking an indictment against Representative Rogers, probably this month, for the acceptance of money in connection with his vote and work on the capital gains bill. There is substantial information about Senator Lindsay as well and his acceptance of money for his vote and support in connection with the capital gains bill. So based on what Mr. Lee gave us and the sort of a kick-off, if you will, we caught the ball and ran with it and have run into some pretty good areas that will very definitely result in charges brought against I can affirmatively represent to you against Representative Rogers as a result. [Hearing, 10/18 20/95, Gordon Exh. J, p. 4]. Senator Lee informed the court, in camera, through his attorney, that he was present at a meeting of Republican legislators with the Governor and his staff in the spring or early summer of 1988 where he was told to back this bill. It is the most important piece of legislation to the governor's office for this legislative year. If anybody raises a question about it, you are to sweep it under the rug. A list was given to him on *645 how to handle any tricky or difficult questions, a script. [Id. at p. 9] If the reference by the Governor's Office to this most important legislation was a reference to the prospective capital gains tax bill as described by Mr. Greer, and not to the retroactive proviso in the Appropriations Bill, which allegedly would have been extremely beneficial to some of the Governor's friends and contributors, what would have been the need to sweep under the rug any tricky questions. The information provided by Senator Lee is consistent with the FD 302 of Lobbyist Lee wherein he referred to a meeting the Governor had with Republican representatives sometimes after early May 1988 in which an answer sheet was distributed to the attendees. A discussion of the capital gains tax investigation would not be complete without mention of a bizarre incident which came to light during the OPR investigation. Prior to the OPR investigation, the transcripts of four of the five persons who testified before the Grand Jury with regard to capital gains 33 disappeared from a file cabinet at the U.S. Attorney's Office and later appeared, unexplained, in AUSA Barton's desk drawer. This disappearance has never been explained or, to the court's knowledge, ever been fully investigated. 4. Visit by Cobb and SA Clemens to Home of Steven H. Smith and Telephone Call to Lindsay. Subsequent to the drawing of the Blanding/Gordon jury and prior to the commencement of opening statements, early on the morning of February 27, 1991, defendants filed a motion to dismiss for prosecutorial misconduct and requested an in camera hearing out of the presence of the government in order to proffer certain information. The hearing involved the unredacted copy of a 302 by SA Richards on May 1, 1989, only received by defendants Blanding/Gordon on February 22, 1991, which defendants alleged substantiated that Cobb not only committed perjury at the Taylor trial, but that the government was aware that he was testifying falsely. [See also, V 2 of this order]. The motion further involved the defendants allegation that Cobb committed perjury before the Grand Jury with regard to his drug usage, and that 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 20 \f U.S. v. Taylor, 956 F.Supp. 622 (1997) information substantiating that charge only came to light as the result of Brady material furnished the defendants by an order of the court on February 14, 1991. In setting out these allegations, Gordon's attorney then addressed the information he wished to proffer concerning conversations he had over the previous two days with defendant Taylor's attorney. After some discussion about how the information should be handled, the court called for Taylor's attorney, as an officer of the court, to appear before the court and make a statement. In his statement, Taylor's attorney recounted how, through a Columbia attorney, Dwight Drake, he had learned that Cobb and an FBI agent had visited the home of a Steven Harley Smith in the early morning hours just prior to Taylor's trial. He stated he recognized the impact this incident could have on the Blanding/Gordon trial and had contacted Gordon's attorney. He stated that several attempts had been made to contact Smith, and that he learned through Drake that Smith was reluctant to get involved. His statement included the following as having been told to him by Dwight Drake: And he said that Mr. Ron Cobb and an FBI agent and he did not name the FBI agent, but he said an FBI agent brought him that the two of them came by Steve Smith's house. He said that they they had a conversation wherein they acknowledged that Senator John Lindsay of Bennettsville was very ill and that his wife was restricting his telephone calls and that it was difficult for just anybody to call and speak to Senator Lindsay. And they knew that Steve Smith was a very close friend of Senator Lindsay, and according to Mr. Drake Steve Smith was asked by Ron Cobb, or the FBI agent, or *646 both, to place a call down to Bennettsville to the Lindsay residence, and using his friendship, they felt sure he could get through to Senator Lindsay, that his wife would let him talk, and apparently that is what did occur. And according to Dwight, who told me this now, the 25th, there was a conversation between Mr. Cobb and Senator Lindsay which he overheard at least one end of. And it had to do with how he should characterize some money that had been given by Ron Cobb to Senator Lindsay. And apparently there was some discussion about whether that money could be characterized as a legal fee. And at the end of the conversation, you know, they left. [In Camera Hearing Tr., 2/27/91, pp. 31 2]. The following day, the hearing continued in camera with the attorneys for the government present. In addition to testimony of SA Richards as to the circumstances surrounding his 302 of May 1, 1989, and the testimony of both Cobb and SA Clemens as to Cobb's drug usage (both issues being addressed elsewhere in this order), both Cobb and SA Clemens testified with regard to the visit to the Smith home. The exchange on direct of Cobb by Gordon reads as follows: Q. If the monies that you gave Senator Lindsay were legitimate fees, then why did you have to make a deal that you wouldn't have to testify against Senator Lindsay? What had he done wrong, if there were no illegal monies passed to him. A. Well, from from my interpretation of the conversation with the FBI, they had other things going that I wasn't aware of. Q. Well, Mr. Cobb, if you weren't aware of them you couldn't testify about them, could you? A. That's correct. Q. So, that couldn't have been the reason for your agreement with the FBI that you wouldn't have to testify against Senator Lindsay? A. Well, obviously, I told obviously I told them the truth about the Magnum thing. And from their vantage point that would be a problem for Senator Lindsay. Q. So, now, the FBI told you it was a problem for Senator Lindsay? A. No, they didn't tell me it was a problem, this is my own I say that, I'm thinking this. Remember, this is back nearly two years ago when you know, you are refreshing me through this stuff. Q. I understand that. I don't have any problem with that. We will take as long as it takes. Before you agreed to talk to the FBI about anything, you told them, I'm caught, I will cooperate, I will talk to you about political corruption, but I won't testify against Jack Lindsay, did you not? 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 21 \f U.S. v. Taylor, 956 F.Supp. 622 (1997) A. I won't do anything against Jack Lindsay, that's correct. Q. And that included testifying? A. That's correct. Q. If you had not done or committed any illegal acts with Jack Lindsay, or if you had no knowledge of Jack Lindsay participating in any illegal acts, it wasn't necessary for you to have that agreement with the FBI, was it? A. My agreement was that I didn't have to testify against Senator Lindsay. Now, as to anything that he had done I know what you are getting at as far as anything that he had done, no, I'm not aware of it, but had there been I wasn't going to be involved in doing anything against the Senator. .... Q. And how did it come about that you contacted Senator Lindsay? A. Because the $10,000 to Magnum was I was going to have to testify to that in court. Senator Lindsay was laying up in the hospital bed dying, and I called. I'm I had a very close personal relationship with him, and I know this is going to hurt him. And I don't want to hurt him, for this to come out, so I was going to minimize it. *647 .... And I couldn't tell him about it, so I got Mike Clemens to, because I couldn't tell him what I was going to testify to and I didn't. Mike Clemens told him what was going to come out, and so it prepared Senator Lindsay for what was going to come out. Q. Isn't it a fact, Mr. Cobb, that the reason you called Senator Lindsay was to determine how you should characterize the $10,000 you gave to him? A. That is absolutely not true. [Gordon's Motion to Dismiss, 2/22/94, Exh. E, pp. 22 8]. The hearing transcript of February 28, 1991, will show that SA Clemens testified about that call to Lindsay on direct by Gordon as follows: Q. And y'all were discussing the fact that Mr. Cobb would probably be cross-examined concerning this $10,000 payoff that he had made to Representative Magnum through Senator Lindsay, correct? A. That's correct. Q. And the $10,000 that he gave Senator Lindsay to deliver the money to Representative Magnum? A. The monies he had paid Mr. Lindsay, yes. Q. And during that discussion, Mr. Cobb indicated that he needed to go call and explain to Senator Lindsay what was going on, is that how it came about? A. Pretty much.... He wanted to make sure that Mr. Lindsay was aware that it was going to come out. Q. And Mr. Cobb was concerned that Mr. Lindsay, Senator Lindsay would find out that he, Mr. Cobb, had told the government that he had made these different payoffs to Senator Lindsay, correct? A. He was concerned about that information, yes. [Id., Exh. D, pp. 24 5]. The record in the Taylor case was supplemented with the in camera proceedings in the Blanding/Gordon case, and at a motion hearing to reconsider Taylor's bond pending appeal held April 11, 1991, the court allowed Taylor to present the testimony of Steven Smith, who appeared under subpoena. In his testimony, Smith confirmed that he received a telephone call and a subsequent visit from Cobb and SA Clemens during the early morning hours of October 17, 1990. He stated that the Senator was not receiving telephone calls from basically anyone at the time. However, due to our friendship and closeness he would accept phone calls from me. He testified that due to the early morning hour he called the Senator's son and asked him to have Lindsay call him. In a further recitation about what transpired that night, Smith testified: A. Well, what was occurring is this. Mr. Cobb was insistent upon and this was the problem which was being addressed. Mr. Cobb when he arrived was insistent upon labeling any exchange of money which was to be brought up in testimony or questions in the case, Mr. Cobb intended 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 22 \f U.S. v. Taylor, 956 F.Supp. 622 (1997) to call that a legal fee. Whether it was or wasn't I don't know and was not familiar at the time with what exchanges of money they were talking about. Mr. Clemens was insistent to Mr. Cobb that he not label it a legal fee, but that he I believe the term to be used was call it what it was. Now, that can't be quoted, but Mr. Clemens was trying to move Mr. Cobb away from the legal fee label to what Mr. Clemens thought to be the truth. Mr. Cobb was resistant to doing that and was very upset that he was being asked to do that. It looked like, sounded like to me when he got there that Mr. Clemens had prevailed in his persuasiveness but Mr. Cobb had placed upon that as a condition or said he would do it if Senator Lindsay gave him the okay or that he knew that Senator Lindsay would not be upset with him for doing that. The purpose of the telephone call was to get Senator Lindsay on the phone so that Mr. Cobb could talk to him and hopefully seek that permission so that Ron could be convinced to go ahead and tell what Mr. Clemens thought was based on whatever information it was they thought to be the truth. *648 .... .... When Ron hung up the phone what he said was he told me and I think this is accurate. Again, it is the middle of the night something to the effect, To do what I had to do. .... A. That evening sitting in the breakfast room.... I asked him I said, Ron, what is all of this about? .... He told me then. He said, I told you, Steve, they had us jammed up on the oil jobbers bill. [Taylor Bond Hearing Tr., 4/11/91, pp. 20 1, 26]. Mr. Smith again testified under subpoena on October 18, 1995, at a hearing on the instant motions to dismiss: A. The issue between Mr. Cobb and Mr. Clemens was the testimony that Mr. Cobb was to give I believe the following day, if my memory is correct, in a trial, with regard to how Mr. Cobb would classify monies that were alleged to have been passed between Mr. Cobb and Senator Lindsay. I don't know what the monies were or anything, but they called them monies. Mr. Cobb was intending to, as related to me, and Mr. Clemens related that as well at some point during our conversation, that Mr. Cobb was going to classify whatever those monies were as an attorney's fee and that he had been authorized to do that by the United States Attorney. [Hearing, 10/18/95, Vol. I, pp. 221 2]. Smith's appearances before this court on these two occasions were under subpoena and his testimony was consistent. And, although Mr. Smith's opinion of the events was that SA Clemens was attempting to persuade Cobb to tell the truth when he testified, it also indicates that SA Clemens, himself, was not entirely truthful in his testimony at the hearing on February 27, 1991, when he described the purpose of the visit as one only to give information to Lindsay. Further, it indicates that Cobb also was not truthful in his testimony at the February 1991 hearing. The court must agree with the defendants' assessment that Lindsay was no stranger to publicity, and a notice to him that his name might appear in the media as a result of Cobb's testimony would certainly not warrant a telephone call to a dying man in the middle of the night. The involvement of an FBI agent in this entire incident was and is shocking to this court. Equally shocking is Cobb's testimony during the hearing on these motions on October 19, 1995. As a result of Smith's testimony that there was an argument between Cobb and SA Clemens as to whether Cobb would classify whatever those monies were as an attorney's fee and that he had been authorized to do that by the United States Attorney, the defendants called Cobb as a witness. Taylor on direct queried: Q. Mr. Cobb, my question to you is, did the United States Attorney tell you that you had his permission to label moneys that you had given Mr. Lindsay as legal fees? A. I had indicated to them that I would call the moneys anything they wanted me to call it, but I won't call it a bribe, and the terminology legals [sic] fees or contributions came up, and it was discussed, and I wasn't told not to use it. Q. Mr. Cobb, didn't you tell us in Mr. Spears' 34 office that you had a conversation with the U.S. Attorney and that he 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 23 \f U.S. v. Taylor, 956 F.Supp. 622 (1997) had told you it would be all right for you to call any money you gave Senator Lindsay a legal fee? A. Mr. Collins, that was in the course of our conversation, and as you will recall, we discussed that for a little while and I think I relayed to you that it was discussed, and I wasn't told not to, nobody ever said, you know nobody ever said, say this, or say that. I implied that I wouldn't say that it was a bribe, and they indicated that I could call it something else, and a legal fee was one of those terms. .... Q. Who told you that, sir? A. I just told, you several people in the U.S. Attorney's Office. Q. Tell me the name of the person who told you that? A. It could have been anybody in the U.S. Attorney's Office, Bart Daniel, John Barton, Dale DuTremble. *649 .... Q. Who? Q. .... Mr. Cobb, did Mr. Daniel, former U.S. Attorney, ever tell you that it was all right with him for you to call any moneys you gave Senator Lindsay legal fees? A. Maybe all of the above. Q. Who? A. It's really tough to answer that yes or no, without explaining A. I would leave it all of the above in the course of conversation. .... In course of conversations, THE WITNESS: the terminology, legal fees, came up. It was maybe suggested that that would be a possibility, because I was adamant about not calling any moneys I gave Senator Lindsay bribes, which I didn't, and don't to this day, but, yes, the term legal fees, by the U.S. Attorney was mentioned as something I could call it. [Hearing Tr., 10/19/95, Vol. II, pp. 24 5]. On cross-examination by the government, the exchange with Cobb on this subject continued: Q. Did Bart Daniel ever tell you you could call it legal fees? A. I have told you that's a very difficult question to say yes. In course of conversations it came up where I could call it legal fees, contributions, or what have you. .... THE WITNESS: Nobody ever programmed me to do that, but in the course of the conversation, it came up that it could be called a legal fee, it could be called contributions, but I wasn't going to call it a bribe. [Id. at pp. 43 4, 46 7]. Contrary to the government's argument that the defendants contend that Cobb had been given permission to call money he gave to Lindsay legal fees, [Gov. s Post Hearing Memo, 10/18/96, p. 25], it is Cobb who contends this in his sworn testimony. In his interview with the DOJ/OPR on September 8, 1994, USA Daniel responded to this allegation: I don't know why Cobb would say it. It never ever happened. On May 26, 1994, AUSA Barton told the DOJ/OPR: I recall nothing about someone coming up and saying to me Hey, Cobb asked if it was ok to call his payments to Lindsay a legal fee. And the notes of a telephone interview of AUSA DuTremble by the DOJ/OPR on November 10, 1994, show: No recollection of Bart D. or any AUSA authorizing Cobb to call payments to JL legal fees' as recalled by Steve Smith Surmises that Cobb may have interpreted USAO's position on the payments You can call it anything you want to as auth to characterize it as a legal fee . Although there is no sworn testimony in evidence to refute Cobb's claim, this court is loath to give credence to Cobb's testimony over the statements of these prosecutors. Although it does not make a specific finding as to Cobb's truthfulness in this regard, the court has no reason to dispute Smith's testimony that Cobb did, in fact, make the statement. 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 24 \f U.S. v. Taylor, 956 F.Supp. 622 (1997) 5. Drug Usage by Cobb. The defendants have argued extensively about Cobb's drug usage during the course of this entire matter. First of all, they complain of the withholding of evidence of his drug usage in possession of the government which was not furnished to them, thus hampering their efforts to impeach Cobb. Secondly, although they appear to argue that his drug usage may have affected his handling of the sting operation and his testimony, there is no real evidence that Cobb was, in fact, under the influence of drugs during these times. Thirdly, they utilize his repeated drug usage to bolster their argument that the government failed to control the actions *650 of a confidential informant in violation of FBI regulations; and, fourthly, they argue that the government's indictment of Cobb on two drug violations just prior to the Blanding/Gordon trial placed Cobb in a position to take the Fifth Amendment and further hamper their impeachment efforts. Cobb was first approached by the FBI on April 28, 1989, and within a day or two became a paid confidential informant. A formal agreement was not entered into with the government until October 11, 1989. On February 21, 1991, Cobb was two misdemeanor drug counts (21 U.S.C. 844(a)), for possession of cocaine on February 2, 1990, and January 11, 1991. He pled guilty to both counts on April 10, 1991. indicted on Cobb's drug usage on the dates of October 13, October 18 and November 18, 1989, was disclosed at the trials. In addition, the indictment for possession of cocaine on February 2, 1990, and January 11, 1991, was returned a few days prior to the Blanding/Gordon trial, and Cobb was allowed to invoke his Fifth Amendment rights as to these two incidents during his testimony at that trial. Cobb pled guilty to these incidents prior to the Derrick and Long trials. SA Clemens testified that he admonished Cobb on the three occasions in late 1989 that his drug usage was not only illegal, but was in violation of his agreement with the government; however, the government did not charge him or discontinue his employment. On July 17, 1990, Cobb testified before the Grand Jury that he had not used drugs since late 1989. Count One of the indictment to which he pled guilty would show his possession of cocaine in February of 1990; 35 therefore, this testimony, by Cobb's own admission, is false. In addition, Count Two of the indictment to which he pled guilty would show his possession of cocaine in January of 1991, which is within the time period between the Taylor trial and the Blanding/Gordon trial. The full scope of Cobb's drug usage was often sought by the defendants in their quest for discovery materials which might impeach Cobb's testimony at defendants' trials. On November 29, 1993, the defendants received a minimum of six FBI documents which revealed that Cobb had been under investigation by the FBI for drug violations since early 1988 [Taylor's Supp.Memo, 2/10/94, Exh. 2], and that he had used cocaine on at least two other previously unknown occasions in May of 1989, after he went to work for the FBI [Id., Exh. 3]. Several of these documents indicate that Cobb was reputed to be a cocaine trafficker and implicated others, such as Greer and Kohn. In contrast to representations by the government on the record in open court that they had given the defendants each and every tape they had [see Hearing Tr., 4/19/95, pp. 9 11], some 50 audiotapes and 118 FD 302s, which contain evidence bearing on Cobb's drug usage and trafficking, were received by defendants in February of 1995 [Taylor's Second Supp.Memo, 8/25/95, pp. 21 2]. It is now evident that Cobb had the reputation of a cocaine user and/or dealer and that this was known to the government prior to their employment of him in the sting. It is also evident that he purchased and/or used cocaine at least periodically during the time he was employed in the sting through the times he testified at the Taylor trial and at the Blanding/ Gordon trial. In his testimony regarding his drug usage, Cobb gave as reasons for the drug usage on which he was questioned as the need to protect his cover and, for one occasion, the emotional effect of the death of Lindsay. Cobb also claimed that the drug deal for which he was initially approached was done solely for the purpose of getting funds to pay his wife's medical bills. Just prior to his trial, Taylor offered to the court an affidavit by Cobb's wife, which was placed under seal, where she affirmatively stated that Cobb did not, in fact, contribute to the payment of her medical bills. *651 All of the defendants, possibly more so Taylor, Blanding and Gordon, were unable to impeach Cobb's 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 25 \f U.S. v. Taylor, 956 F.Supp. 622 (1997) testimony and confront him with the fact that he had been involved in drugs on more occasions and over a longer period of time than disclosed, and that his involvement in drugs was so deep that he had earned the reputation of a trafficker. This information was, of course, known to the government since at least February of 1988. A. Yes, ma'am, I did. Q. Was it on your house? A. Yes, ma'am, my home. 6. Evidence re Kohn. Kohn's involvement in the extensive use of cocaine and alcohol was admitted by him during the trials. On December 6, 1989, Cobb, as a government informant, participated in the videotaping of an occasion on which he purchased $500 worth of cocaine from Kohn. Kohn is then shown on the tape using cocaine. This tape (# 7) was not turned over to the defendants until sometime around the Derrick trial; however, Taylor concedes that he received a letter from the government very shortly before trial telling him that the government had evidence of Kohn giving cocaine to Cobb. He argues that he was deeply involved in preparing for trial; and, that since this is all that he was told, he did not take the time to pursue it. He indicates that had the government disclosed to him that a sale was recorded on video tape, and had he been told of the large amount of the purchase or that the tape showed the actual use of the cocaine by Kohn, he would have recognized its significance. Taylor contends that the jury's assessment of Kohn's credibility could well have been impacted by actually viewing Kohn snorting cocaine. Although it is the government's responsibility to disclose evidence to the defendants in a timely and honest manner, it is also the responsibility of the defense to review that evidence when it is disclosed. The reference by the court to this particular issue, therefore, is not to excuse Taylor's failure to review the tape, but simply to show the cumulative effect on the defense of potentially impeachable material not being fully or timely disclosed. The defendants argue that during the Taylor trial, in response to Taylor's effort to impeach Kohn, the government misled the court as to the relevancy of the issue of a personal insurance settlement by Kohn following Hurricane Hugo. The government objected on relevancy grounds when the defense attempted to cross-examine Kohn as follows: Q. Did you have an insurance claim personally? Q. How much did you receive for that? Was it $100,000? A. No it was not. Mr. Daniel: Your Honor, I object as to the relevance. The Court: It doesn't sound too relevant, Mrs. Courie. 36 [Taylor Trial Tr., Vol. IV, p. 141]. What the government knew, but was unknown to the defendant Taylor and the subsequent trial defendants, was that there existed a tape (Tape # 98), made on April 26, 1990, of a discussion between Cobb and Kohn which would have gone directly to Kohn's credibility. Cobb inquires about Kohn's weekend plans and the conversation continues: Kohn: Ah, I'm not sure. I got a It ain't nothing exciting, just try to get caught up on a couple (unintelligible) in Charleston and get all my stuff together for my financial insurance settlement. Cobb: Mm, hmm. Kohn: Now that was the greatest scam I've ever pulled off. Turned a $500 claim into a $100,000 settlement. Cobb: Wow. That would be your hit for the year. Kohn: Mm, hmm. Cobb: A nice one. Kohn: Insurance is (unintelligible) I, set this company up. I mean I set the insurance company so there is nothing they can do on it. Cobb: Huh? Kohn: Set them up the whole way through and, uh, said well I need to bring my dad *652 into contract. He says you don't need to bring anything. See I don't understand the instructions. I don't understand. He said all we're gonna talk about is how much money they're gonna give you. You see, the, the high, the lowest figure they're talking about 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 26 \f U.S. v. Taylor, 956 F.Supp. 622 (1997) borders in my range. (Unintelligible). I think I got them on unfair claims. (Unintelligible). [Audiotape # 98, 4/26/90]. The defendants refer to this tape as devastating evidence, which was not furnished to them until after this court's order of November 9, 1994. As well as being evidence material to the impeachment of Kohn, the first part of this same tape records a meeting concerning the pari-mutuel bill. The tape is unintelligible for the most part in this regard; however, it is significant that the cover sheet (FD 302) specifically lists Taylor as one of the speakers. It is impossible, therefore, for the court to understand how the government could consider this particular tape irrelevant. It is well established that the government must often take its witnesses as it finds them. Yet in this case, Kohn was not only employed by the government as a confidential informant after he was approached by the FBI in May of 1990, but he was used to assist Cobb in actively soliciting fellow legislators and became a significant player in the sting operation. 7. Control of Sting Operation by Cobb. Another of the defendants' allegations is that the government lost control over Cobb, its primary undercover informant. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals has referred to Cobb as the cornerstone of the government's case. The defendants allege that under the regulations governing this sting, Cobb was forbidden to go out looking for people to bribe this was to be strictly an open door operation. Yet we see that Cobb on occasion chose the legislators he wished to approach. 37 He was admonished that he could not use drugs during the course of the investigation, yet he repeatedly did so. It was Cobb who arranged the meetings with the defendants and notified the FBI when to turn on the video cameras. Cobb also convinced SA Clemens to participate with him in the very questionable 2:00 a.m. visit to Steve Smith's house and the telephone call to Lindsay. The government originally paid Cobb $2,000 per month and later raised the amount to $4,000 per month. It is part of the record that these payments continued through the original trials, but it is unknown to the court whether these monthly payments are still being made. In addition, the government returned to him the $20,000 cash payment Cobb had made to an undercover agent in the cocaine investment deal that precipitated his involvement in Lost Trust. A $150,000 bonus for Cobb has been approved by the government; however, the last mention of this that the court can find in the record is that the payment was put on hold, and whether this bonus has ever been paid to Cobb is unknown to the court. If not, this bonus takes on some significance should he be required to testify in any retrials. The court is of the opinion that Cobb maneuvered himself into the driver's seat position, and the government was a hostage to him. It is apparent that the government knew it had to court Cobb in order for him to work with them effectively. At times, he literally took over the investigation and directed its course. From its actions, it would *653 appear the government was afraid Cobb would pull out of the investigation and ruin their cases. According to a statement SA Clemens made to the OPR, Cobb flatly told the government from the very beginning that he would not testify against Lindsay and they could just take him to jail. Thus, Cobb forced the government on several important occasions into conduct not acceptable to the court. 8. Government Targets in Violation of Sting Guidelines. The portion of Cobb's manuscript cited above to show the control Cobb had over the investigation has also been cited by the defendants to show that Cobb was encouraged to use the sting operation to pursue individuals already targeted by the FBI in violation of FBI regulations and that selective prosecution was also an issue. In a teletype from the Director of the FBI to FBI Columbia, receive-stamped 89 NOV 1 [Taylor's Third Supp.Memo, 3/28/96, Exh. 4], in which the Columbia office is notified that the use of the pari-mutuel bill in this investigation is approved, the Columbia office is cautioned: Columbia should ensure that this scenario is executed pursuant to investigative plan outlined in UCO Proposal, i.e., a passive approach through contacts with predicated lobbyists. The defendants contend that this investigation was anything but passive. At a hearing on April 19, 1995, Gordon published several pages from the Cobb manuscript, The Second Burning of Columbia. 38 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 27 \f U.S. v. Taylor, 956 F.Supp. 622 (1997) COBB: B.J. Gordon, they had files on him; they had wanted him so f'n bad, they couldn't get him. D: Because they just didn't have the evidence? COBB: He had been to court two or three times. They had charged him two or three times. But he could always beat them. But he didn't outrun this boy. D: And yet the FBI was okay with that? I mean the FBI COBB: They wanted him bad, bad. [Hearing Tr., 4/19/95, p. 24]. He then continues to publish: D: Did you, the pari-mutuel, put on the table as the idea? My experience in Alabama is that pari-mutuel betting is a black issue. And you had to know when you put pari- mutuel betting on the table that you're going to have a skewed number of blacks. Did you know that? Did the FBI know that? COBB: Sure they knew it. I knew it. Hell, if I knew it I know they did. But we didn't discuss about the numbers. I'd talk a lot of times, I would make the comment a lot of times that I could have the whole black caucus. There would be no more damn niggers. It was kind of funny to them for a while until we got half of them and they said, pull in the reins, but believe me, we could have had most of them. Because you throw out some dollars and the mother f's first are going to be knocking the doors down. They were easy. Even B.J. as much trouble as they had with him. Shit I got him. The way I got him, f, you don't get away from it. [Id. at pp. 24 5]. The above statements by Cobb would certainly indicate that the investigation went far outside the guidelines set forth for this sting. 9. The Report by the OPR As hereinbefore mentioned, following the filing of the Taylor and Gordon motions to dismiss, USA J. Preston Strom, in February 1994, requested the Office of Professional Responsibility of the Department of Justice (DOJ/OPR) to investigate the allegations of prosecutorial misconduct raised by the defendants' motions. This procedure was unusual in that such investigations generally are not conducted by the OPR until after a judicial finding of misconduct. The OPR bifurcated the investigation, requesting the FBI/OPR to investigate the *654 allegations against SA Clemens. The DOJ/OPR then proceeded to address only the USAO's failure to provide the two 302s complained of in both motions, those appearing to be the documents which raise the most serious misconduct issues. [Hearing, 4/19/95, Defs. Exh. 30, p. 10, ftn. 15]. These are the 302s dated June 22, 1989 and September 25, 1989 (the secret 302), which were not received by the defendants until November 1993. Both of these 302s dealt with Cobb's characterization of the cash payments he made to the defendants. Taylor's motion also included arguments of intentional wrongdoing in the government's failure to produce numerous additional documents, but the investigation did not address these. On December 6, 1994, the FBI/OPR reported its findings to the DOJ/OPR [Id., Exh. 45], and the DOJ/OPR amended its report to include these findings on February 16, 1995 [Id., Exh. 44]. The October 18th report concludes that, although ..., mistakes incremental and misjudgments were made by the FBI and prosecutors alike in our view, it is more plausible that these incremental failings rather than any intentional and wrongful decision to conceal led to the failure in the first two Lost Trust cases to provide the defense with the 302s dated June 22 and September 25, 1989. [Id., Exh. 30, p. 22]. The amended report of February 16, 1994, made a finding that sanctions against SA Clemens were warranted as a result of the following infractions: as case ... failure to effectively discharge his duties in connection with the management of discovery documents transmitted to the USAO; his failure to properly agent 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 28 \f U.S. v. Taylor, 956 F.Supp. 622 (1997) review all of his interview reports to properly prepare for testimony; unintentional misrepresentation in trial testimony; failure to properly maintain investigative notes in accordance with Bureau rules and regulations; failure to inform either the USAO or the Bureau upon discovery of the interview notes and his subsequent neglect of duty to report such an action as required in light of the controversy surrounding his testimony; and failure to advise OPR of the interview notes. [Id., Exh. 44, p. 13]. The sanctions imposed have been previously cited in this order. During its investigation, the OPR conducted numerous interviews, the notes of which, by order of the court, were furnished to the court and the defendants. The defendants have vigorously contested the limited scope of the investigation and the report. They question the decision to focus on only two 302s in light of their numerous allegations; they contend that numerous interviews were not incorporated into the report, and that the report does not accurately reflect the results of the interviews conducted. The court must agree in that there is an obvious omission of any consideration of the statement given to the OPR by SA Dick that it was clear to him that the monies Cobb paid to Lindsay were in violation of the Hobbs Act even though Cobb would never allow these transactions to be characterized as bribes and that this was discussed many times among SA Clemens, the USAO and himself. SA Dick, as the supervisor of the White Collar Crime section of the Criminal Division, was thus the supervisor of the Lost Trust investigation. His statement that these discussions frequently occurred do not appear to be taken into consideration by the FBI/OPR in its determination as to Clemens alleged perjury on February 28, 1991. At the time the DOJ/OPR and FBI/OPR investigations took place, only the motions of defendants Taylor and Gordon were under consideration; joinder by defendants Blanding, Derrick and Long in these motions and the filing of Derrick's dismissal motion came later. Further, the motions of Taylor and Gordon address issues based on additional discovery received in November of 1993. Subsequently, the government was ordered by several court orders to furnish other materials, which have led to additional allegations of misconduct not addressed by the OPR. The court has carefully reviewed all of the interview notes. Although it will not make a definitive finding of misconduct by the OPR, it does appear that many questions were left either uninvestigated and/or unanswered. *655 Some of the pending allegations arose from additional discovery now in the hands of the defendants that was not before the OPR. The government continues to rely heavily on the findings of the OPR; this court does not share in that view. Therefore, it is only in a limited context that the court has considered the OPR's conclusions. The OPR report did reveal that the government rushed into the Taylor trial before it was prepared to go to court. AUSA DuTremble has cited pressure by the Governor [Hearing, 10/18 20/95, Gordon Exh. P] as a reason for the government's haste. Other prosecutors indicated that it was important to the government to convict Taylor early on in the hope that other defendants would plead guilty as a result. It is also reflected in the report that during the investigation and preparation for trial there was utter confusion as to discovery and some dissention in the ranks both at the FBI and the AUSO, and that no real guidance was provided by the FBI to SA Clemens, a first-office agent. In addition, in light of the pending trial status of these defendants, they object on the grounds of prejudicial pretrial publicity to a press conference held by FBI Director Louis Freeh on a visit to Columbia, South Carolina, following the issuance of the OPR report, in which he announced that the government had been cleared of all misconduct allegations. This press conference by Director Freeh presents a serious problem for the court. The lofty respect inherent in his position in the minds of the public is probably unparalleled. The legal position of these defendants at this time is that they are under indictment pending trial. Although some of the evidence before this court in its consideration of the motions to dismiss for prosecutorial misconduct may not be admissible at trial under the Federal Rules of Evidence, certainly much of it would be. A pretrial public statement by the FBI Director that this evidence has already been found to be without merit is appalling to this court. 10. Continuing Discovery Problems. 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 29 \f U.S. v. Taylor, 956 F.Supp. 622 (1997) This court has found that the government continued to incrementally provide evidence relative to these motions even after recusal of the USAO for South Carolina and the appointment of attorneys from the Public Integrity Section of the DOJ in Washington. A review of the record will show that, following a status conference on October 20, 1994, the court in a written order filed November 9, 1994, ORDERED, that the United States make available to the within-named defendants, their attorneys and agents, no later than December 1, 1994, all audiotapes and videotapes and all reports of interviews (FBI FD 302s) and agents' rough notes pertinent thereto resulting from the Operation Lost Trust investigation. [Order, 11/9/94, p. 2]. Some ten protective orders and orders ruling on requested in camera review were then filed by the court. On March 15 and 17, 1995, defendants Taylor and Gordon filed discovery motions relative to the motions to dismiss, which were heard on April 19, 1995. On April 20, 1995, the court ORDERED, that all documents and/ or materials in possession of the government dealing with these cases and not presently available to the defendants in the evidence room be produced by the government direct to the court at Charleston, South Carolina, not later than Monday, May 8, 1995, for in camera inspection by internal administrative documents alleged by the government to be privileged are to be designated as such upon submission. the court. .... All [Order, 4/19/95, p. 3]. Twelve boxes of documents were submitted by the government to the court for in camera review, and a detailed 21 page discovery order was filed as to the disposition of the materials therein on July 25, 1995. In this order the court notes: Defendants argue that the pattern and practice of behavior by the government has instilled in them a deep sense of mistrust and that a full in camera inspection of all materials in possession of the government was warranted. The government, although acknowledging the existence of an open file policy, has continued to argue *656 as to what is and is not discoverable pursuant to Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194 [10 L.Ed.2d 215] (1963). In response to defendants' argument that the 65 audio tapes furnished in March 1995 should have been furnished with discovery materials for the original trials, the government claims that they dealt exclusively with drugs; that they were not turned over because they had not been and would not be used at trial, and, therefore, they were not relevant and not discoverable under Brady. The court finds the government's argument in this regard ludicrous. The record in these cases is clear that the drug investigation was hand-in-glove with the corruption investigation known as Lost Trust. Ten of the twenty-eight defendants pled to drug charges. Although the purpose of this order is not to address the motions to dismiss, government arguments such as this cause the court to look very closely at what was withheld by the government that may have jeopardized the rights of these defendants. There also has been much discussion throughout these cases of the impact of an investigation by the government into federal violations in the handling of legislation known as the capital gains tax bill that had come before the South Carolina Legislature. The defendants claim there was a cover-up by the government and that they were not furnished the discovery needed to pursue the calling and/or impeachment of witnesses. The government acknowledges the investigation but states emphatically that it found this to be a non-issue and not relevant to the trials of these defendants. Again, the court does not wish at this time to make a finding on the merits of either argument; however, inasmuch as one of the key figures in the Lost Trust investigation pled to a RICO violation, one of the predicate offenses of which was the taking of a bribe from the government's cooperating subject and key Lost Trust witness, Ron Cobb, in relation to the capital gains tax bill, the government cannot now claim that its investigation into improprieties relevant to the capital gains tax legislation was irrelevant to these cases. The court, therefore, can understand the defendants' arguments of mistrust. 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 30 \f U.S. v. Taylor, 956 F.Supp. 622 (1997) [Order, 7/25/95, pp. 6 8]. This order also set forth a schedule for the filing of additional memorandums and set an evidentiary hearing on the subject motions for October 18, 1995. In the interim, the government furnished additional materials for in camera inspection on two separate occasions, and the court issued its rulings with regard to these materials on September 7 and October 6, 1995. The October 6th order addresses a file received by the court which included copies of the materials [obviously discoverable FD 302s and agents' rough notes], and further states in pertinent part: It is unnecessary for the court to reiterate here the lengthy history of discovery problems in these cases. Suffice it to say that the materials furnished to the defendants and to the court on October 4, 1995, should have been furnished long ago. [Order, 10/6/95, p. 2]. The first hearing on the motions to dismiss had been set for October 18, 1995, since the previous July. Yet here, just short of a year after the court's order establishing the evidence room and just two weeks prior to a hearing of the motions, the government was still turning over relevant evidence to these defendants. In addition, during the October 1995 hearing the existence of several FBI CW (Cooperating Witness) files came to light. One of the files contained an FD 302 not previously furnished to defendants. Defendants also moved for this court to reconsider portions of its July 25, 1995 order, and the court agreed to an in camera inspection of the CW files and several of the boxes of materials denied to defendants on July 25th. At the October hearing, the defendants also requested and received from the FBI computer-generated printouts of the inventories of the FBI's entire Lost Trust and Capital Gains files. On January 19, 1996, defendant Taylor moved the court to direct the government to provide access to all of the documents identified thereon. The court's order of February 6, 1996, as amended February 23, 1996, resulted. *657 The court's frustration at this point is evident in its February 6th order, which states in part: It is well past time for discovery to be completed. Although the court in no way wishes to jeopardize the investigative methods of the federal government, it is clear from a review of the records now before it that little, if anything, contained therein can still be classified as sensitive. Additionally, all of the materials furnished are subject to protective orders restricting the use and dissemination of these materials. The court has previously opined that a wider latitude must be given with regard to materials to be furnished for the purposes of the defendants' pursuit of their motions to dismiss for prosecutorial misconduct than might be given for trial preparation. The alleged misconduct of government attorneys and agents during the preparation and trials of these cases is the basis for the defendants' motions, and defendants' argument that they are entitled to a thorough review of the government's records is not without merit, particularly in light of the discovery history in these matters. .... ... although there may be some justification for the delay in furnishing some materials to the defendants as ordered by the court, the volume of the materials which have surfaced just over the past few months and their possible significance to the defendants is of concern to the court. [Order, 2/6/96, pp. 7 8]. In its Post Hearing Memorandum, the government attempts to explain why certain files were not submitted to the court as and when ordered. As shown above, the court ordered the government to make available to the defendants all documents known by the government to be of a nature to be used by defendants to impeach witnesses or support the defendants' theories of their defenses. These cases were and are being prosecuted by various government attorneys, and for various reasons they have withheld documents that would have been of assistance to the defendants in defending the charges against them. The government now concedes that numerous mistakes were made in furnishing discovery and the DOJ/OPR in its report found that incremental and misjudgments were made by the FBI mistakes 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 31 \f U.S. v. Taylor, 956 F.Supp. 622 (1997) and prosecutors alike and, in our view, it is more plausible that these incremental failings rather than any intentional and wrongful decisions to conceal led to the failure in the first two Lost Trust cases to provide the defense with the 302s [required]. [Gov's Post Hearing Memo, 10/18/96, p. 6]. The court cannot agree with this finding because the failings of the government to provide meaningful discovery were so numerous that it would be disingenuous to say that these mistakes were incremental failings rather than intentional or wrongful decisions. In fact, these failings, spanned over the time from the beginning of these cases until just several months ago, amount to a pattern of conduct. In undisputed testimony on October 3, 1996 [Hearing Tr., 10/3/96, p. 182], the court was informed that prior to his trial Taylor received only 66 of the 550 plus or minus 302s and 26 of the 227 plus or minus tapes that are now in defendants' possession. The number of 302s and tapes received pretrial by the other defendants would vary only slightly. VI. THE COURT'S SUPERVISORY POWER In the case of United States v. Banks, 383 F.Supp. 389 (D.S.D.1974), appeal dismissed, United States v. Means, 513 F.2d 1329 (8th Cir.1975), that court, in a Memorandum Decision treating defendants' motion for acquittal as a motion to dismiss for government misconduct, dismissed with prejudice the charges against the defendants by the use of its supervisory power. The Banks court, citing to McNabb v. United States, 318 U.S. 332, 63 S.Ct. 608, 87 L.Ed. 819 (1943), decided that the court's supervisory power can be utilized whenever the administration of justice is tainted, and, indeed, it is the court's duty to [establish] and [maintain] civilized standards of procedure and evidence. [Id. at 340, 63 S.Ct. at 613]. Some of the circuits *658 have found that demonstrable prejudice must exist in order for the court to exercise its supervisory power; however, the court in Banks found that it need not address whether due process was offended when the facts showed such aggravated conduct as to warrant dismissal. In the Fourth Circuit case, United States v. Omni Intern. Corp., 634 F.Supp. 1414 (D.Md.1986), Judge Black discusses the requirement of prejudice and concludes that [a] common thread underlying many decisions is that the magnitude of the misconduct affects the use of the supervisory power, whether or not actual prejudice is shown. Id. at 1438. See, e.g., United States v. Serubo, 604 F.2d 807, 818 (3d Cir.1979) (prosecutorial conduct extreme); United States v. Hogan, 712 F.2d 757 (2d Cir.1983) (misconduct flagrant); United States v. Fischbach & Moore, Inc., 576 F.Supp. 1384, 1396 (W.D.Pa.1983) (isolated incident of misconduct). This court has weighed the seriousness of the [3] [2] misconduct against the available remedies, and finds that, as in the Banks and Omni cases, the misconduct here is repetitious, flagrant and longstanding. See Banks, 383 F.Supp. at 392; Omni, 634 F.Supp. at 1438; United States v. Hogan, 712 F.2d at 761; United States v. Lawson, 502 F.Supp. 158, 172 (D.Md.1980). I also find that the government's misconduct need not be so unfair or imprudent as to offend due process' before exercise of this [court's] supervisory power is appropriate. McNabb, 318 U.S. at 340, 63 S.Ct. at 613. Although this court is of the opinion that the sixth amendment right to a fair trial guaranteed to each of these defendants has been jeopardized because of the government's actions throughout these proceedings, the Constitutional issues raised by the instant motions need not be addressed. The court is convinced that this investigation began in an appropriate fashion. It is, after all, the responsibility of the FBI and the USAO to pursue information with regard to illegal acts within their jurisdiction. It is the opinion of the court, however, that some of the investigators and lead prosecutors got lost on their way to the lofty goal of weeding out drugs and corruption from the South Carolina State House. Overzealousness and political pressure upon those in positions of authority appear to be the detours that led the government to rush to trial, especially in the cases of Taylor, Blanding and Gordon; to withhold volumes of exculpatory evidence; to allow perjured testimony to stand uncorrected on more than one occasion; to allow its primary cooperating witness, Cobb, to take an unusual amount of control of the sting operation; to go outside of its own regulations to target certain legislators, and to mislead this court to such an extent as to perpetrate a fraud upon the court. While lawyers representing private parties may indeed, must do everything ethically permissible to advance their clients' interests, lawyers representing the government in 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 32 \f U.S. v. Taylor, 956 F.Supp. 622 (1997) criminal cases serve truth and justice first. The prosecutor's job isn't just to win, but to win fairly, staying well within the rules. [Citations omitted]. As Justice Douglas once warned, [t]he function of the prosecutor under the Federal Constitution is not to tack as many skins of victims as possible to the wall. His function is to vindicate the right of people as expressed in the laws and give those accused of crime a fair trial. Donnelly v. DeChristoforo, 416 U.S. 637, 648 49, 94 S.Ct. 1868, 1874, 40 L.Ed.2d 431 (1974) (Douglas, J., dissenting). U.S. v. Kojayan, 8 F.3d 1315, 1323 (9th Cir.1993). Almost without exception, the lead prosecutors in these cases had practiced before this court many times, and the open file policy of this district and this court had never before come into question. USA Daniel was an Assistant U.S. Attorney in Charleston for several years and prosecuted high-profile, multi-defendant cases before this court. The open file policy was never disputed during those trials, and Daniel was totally familiar with it. As the United States Attorney guiding the prosecution of the within cases, it was his responsibility to oversee the handling of discovery. The withholding of such a voluminous array of discovery which the government had to know was exculpatory and relevant to the defenses of these defendants is unprecedented before this court. The court *659 finds that these violations are too numerous and too specific to certain issues to be considered simply unintentional or the result of neglect. For example, it is unfathomable that the government could have possibly considered the drug investigation of Cobb prior to his employment as a confidential informant, or the investigation of Cobb, Lindsay and Greer in the capital gains tax investigation, as anything but relevant. Even more offensive to the court are the continual misrepresentations made to the court that all discovery to which the defendants were entitled had been turned over to them. The government had to have been aware of so much information that incriminated public figures holding powerful positions, yet it did not submit to the court for review the discovery it claimed would jeopardize on-going investigations or that it claimed to be irrelevant. The constant assurances that we have given them everything, the veracity of which the court had no reason at that time to question, rises to the level of outrageous conduct. It would be impossible to cite to each instance where this type of assurance was repeated. It appears that in these cases, much of the government's misconduct actually stems from its failure to disclose evidence to the defendants. In the case of United States v. DeMarco, 407 F.Supp. 107 (C.D.Cal.1975), the withholding of exculpatory evidence alone was sufficient to grant a dismissal of the indictment, albeit without prejudice. His [the prosecutor's] duty is to provide exculpatory evidence to the defense and then seek to rebut it before the trier of fact. It is not the prosecutor's function to structure a proceeding in such a way that exculpatory material is concealed from the defense, the court, and the jury. Id. at 112. In addition, the court finds that the government, during the period following remand of these cases and in connection with the instant motions, continued its course of action with regard to the disclosure of evidence, in violation of court orders. Its attitude concerning discovery continued well into 1996, even after the court admonished it that the determination of relevancy of the materials relating to the motions to dismiss was within the jurisdiction of the court and not the government. The court is of the opinion that an investigation and subsequent prosecution of what might have started out with the altruistic motive of ridding the State Legislature of drugs and political corruption became a political bombshell that backfired. The entire Lost Trust matter was a political coup as well as a political hot potato for the United States Attorney's Office. USA Daniel called a press conference to announce the initial indictments. The defendants had claimed that this press conference constituted prejudicial pretrial publicity and they now question whether authority for it was even given USA Daniel, as required, by the Department of Justice. No substantial evidence one way or the other on the question of authority was ever offered, nor does the court find that the defendants have offered any additional testimony to meet the burden of proving that they were directly prejudiced by this press conference. 39 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 33 \f U.S. v. Taylor, 956 F.Supp. 622 (1997) This press conference did create, however, an atmosphere of public expectation from which the government could not retreat, even when the investigation led to roads it did not want to travel. When they chose Cobb as the focal point of the sting, they had to carry all the baggage he brought with him his drug use, his refusal to involve Lindsay, his apparent inability to be totally truthful, and his unwillingness to follow instructions. The government lost control of its star witness, both during the sting operation and during his testimony at the trials. This allowed Cobb to choose the legislators he wished to *660 solicit, specifically, Derrick, Gordon and members of the Black Caucus for whatever his purposes and to protect those he wished by characterizing as he saw fit the payments he made to them, even to the point of perjuring himself with regard to payoffs he made to Lindsay. Evidence of how Cobb often paid various legislators a few hundred dollars to keep them friendly and that it was no concern of his how the recipients handled the monies, was not furnished by the government so as to allow the defendants to attempt to impeach Cobb's testimony that the payments he made to these defendants (excluding Long) were known by him and by them to be bribes. The court further finds that the government did, in fact, allow testimony from Cobb, Clemens and Greer that it knew to be untrue to stand uncorrected. This court shares the concern expressed by the court in United States v. Wallach, 935 F.2d 445, 457 (2d Cir.1991): We fear that given the importance of [a witness's] testimony to the case, the prosecutors may have consciously avoided recognizing the obvious [that he] was not telling the truth. Once the government entered into the agreement with Cobb that he would never have to testify against Lindsay, it put itself in an untenable position. Its cases against these defendants rested in large measure on Cobb's testimony at trial. Sufficient evidence has now been disclosed to prove that Cobb did pay a bribe to Lindsay in connection with the capital gains tax bill and, further, that Cobb admitted as early as May 1, 1989, that he had paid Lindsay a bribe in connection with the oil jobbers bill. His sworn testimony that he never paid Lindsay a bribe was perjurious several times over. Unfortunately, SA Clemens had helped to dig the hole in which he found himself and, apparently, felt he had to play out the scenario to the end. When the government found itself in a position which forced it to investigate Greer, the situation became even more explosive. There is no way the court can ignore the inconsistencies in and omissions from the record in the matter of Greer and the capital gains tax bill. The government's actions as outlined in this order suggest a total avoidance of pursuing information that might have proved adverse to Greer. The record is replete with implications that Greer was heavily involved in the payoffs related to the capital gains tax bill, yet no FD 302s or agents' rough notes of any debriefings of Greer regarding capital gains and no indication the government ever sought to review his financial records can be found. Even the information advanced by the government at Greer's sentencing that would tend to be in Greer's favor is not substantiated by anything in the record. His testimony before the Grand Jury would have to be perjured if the arguments advanced by the government at Greer's sentencing hearing are true. Alternatively, if Greer told the truth to the Grand Jury, then the government has lied to the court. The government's failure to fully investigate Greer might be excused as falling within the province of the government's prosecutorial discretion if his alleged involvement was isolated. The fact that it surfaced in an investigation resulting in the convictions of these defendants and may have had an impact on the fairness of their trials puts the government's handling of Greer's involvement in an entirely different light. Most offensive to the court, however, is that the government sat silent when it knew that its silence would not only foil the efforts of the defendants to fully develop defenses to which they were entitled, but would misrepresent facts to both the Grand Jury and the trial jury, and mislead the court to such an extent as to effect its rulings at trial and in collateral proceedings. As reluctant as this court is to call it such this silence in several instances constitutes subornation of perjury. This court will not shrink from its share of responsibility and admits its total reliance on the government's representations, at least through the original trials. It did warn the government on numerous occasions that, if it was not being candid and forthright, the court would take the appropriate steps available to it. Without the defendants' unrelenting pursuit of their motions, however, much of what is now known may never have seen the light of day. The government attempts *661 to show its willingness to own up to any misconduct in a footnote to its final memorandum, stating that it was the 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 34 \f U.S. v. Taylor, 956 F.Supp. 622 (1997) expanded discovery voluntarily furnished by the government following remand that led to these motions and not the defendants' own investigative work or requests under the FOIA. [Gov's Post Hearing Memo, 10/18/96, p. 29, ftn. 13]. Considering the on-going discovery problems in these cases, the court finds this absurd. Because the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals was also unaware of the substantial amount and probative content of discovery materials withheld, had these cases not been remanded for retrial on entirely different grounds, the convictions of these defendants would stand. It was not until the first wave of discovery for retrials, which contained numerous previously withheld documents, was furnished in November of 1993 that the court had any reason to believe that some of its previous rulings were based on limited and/or erroneous information. Thereafter, for the purposes of the motions to dismiss, it allowed great latitude in the disclosure of discovery materials. Only then was the wide-ranging scope of the government's misconduct available to the defendants and apparent to the court. There is no way to avoid the conclusion that the various and repeated acts of the government were simply wrong; that the government acted in bad faith, and its misconduct is not only greatly offensive to this court, but has interfered with this court's duty to insure the proper administration of justice. In summary, the court is of the opinion that the evidence of the government's misconduct from the time this investigation commenced until the present, in its totality, is sufficiently egregious to warrant dismissal of these indictments with prejudice under the doctrine of supervisory power. It is, therefore, ORDERED, that the Superseding Indictment in Criminal Nos. 3:90 00339 and 3:90 00434 against defendants LUTHER LANGFORD TAYLOR, LARRY BLANDING and BENJAMIN J. GORDON, JR. be, and the same is hereby dismissed with prejudice. It is ORDERED FURTHER, that the Indictment in Criminal No. 3:91 00091 against defendant PAUL WAYNE DERRICK be, and the same is hereby dismissed with prejudice. It is ORDERED FURTHER, that the Indictment in Criminal No. 3:91 00384 against defendant JEFFERSON MARION LONG, JR. be, and the same is hereby, dismissed with prejudice. AND IT IS SO ORDERED. Footnotes 1 2 The court has also sought to develop some of the issues by reviewing other documents on record in the evidence room. In the interest of brevity and continuity, the designations of the defendants by their surnames are used to denote the defendants personally and, where appropriate, to denote the defendants by and through their attorneys. Three other defendants indicted as a result of the Operation Lost Trust investigation went to trial on Hobbs Act charges. The convictions of two of these defendants were upheld by the Appeals Court; the third was found not guilty. All other Lost Trust defendants pleaded to either corruption or drug charges. The record subsequently shows that the government made a decision to start over on discovery by providing it again. [DOJ/OPR Report, 10/18/4, p. 10]. Derrick also filed a separate motion to dismiss on grounds of prosecutorial misconduct and entrapment on April 19, 1995, which he supplemented on September 5, 1995. The government filed its opposition on September 27, 1995. In the summer of 1996, Derrick requested consideration of this motion without oral argument on the issue of entrapment only, and dismissal on this ground was denied by this court's order of August 7, 1996. Upon Daniel's resignation as United States Attorney, John S. Simmons was appointed in early 1992 to that post. Upon Simmons' resignation effective in April of 1993, Margaret B. Seymour was appointed Interim U.S. Attorney, followed by the interim appointment of J. Preston Strom in May 1993. Strom's permanent appointment became effective July 30, 1993. The reports of the DOJ/OPR and FBI/OPR dated October 18, 1994, December 6, 1994, and February 16, 1995 [Hearing 4/19/95, Defendants Exhibits 30, 45 and 44 respectively] will be discussed later in this order. The disclosure of discovery to defendants is primarily the responsibility of the USAO. Unless so distinguished, however, subsequent references herein to the government include all of the government agencies involved in the investigation and prosecution of these cases. In the eyes of the court there is no difference. Those indicted for crimes have a right to 3 4 5 6 7 8 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 35 \f U.S. v. Taylor, 956 F.Supp. 622 (1997) 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 look to only one body the government for due process and a fair trial. One agency cannot point its finger at another, declaring it's their fault it's not our fault. It is the United States, represented by the United States Attorney, that is seeking redress; and, if a defendant does not receive a fair trial because of the failure of any one agency, that failure must be imputed to the government as a whole. From this period on, the court conducted numerous in camera inspections of discovery materials at the request of the government. All documents ordered to be turned over to the defendants were done so under protective orders. The Capital Gains Tax issue is fully addressed hereinafter in this order. Under the terms of this conditional severance, defendant Gordon was rejoined in this matter by order of January 21, 1997. Hereinafter, the designation USA is used to denote United States Attorney; the designation AUSA is used to denote Assistant United States Attorney, and the designation USAO is used to denote United States Attorney's Office. This motion was denied by The Honorable Charles E. Simons, Jr., U.S.D.J., who was originally assigned to hear this case. The case was subsequently reassigned to the undersigned. Co-defendant Fant had pled three days before. This disclosure followed a hearing on defendant Gordon's Brady motions of November 5, 1990, and January 7, 1991, wherein the court directed the government to furnish the specified material. An FBI FD 302 (sometimes referred to herein simply as a 302) is a government form used by the FBI. Its Manual of Administrative Operations and Procedures, Part II, Section 10 12(3), requires that [o]riginal notes of interview with prospective witnesses and/or suspects and subjects must be retained in the 1A section of the case file. That is, in any interview where preparation of an FD 302 is required (an interview where it is anticipated the results will become the subject of court testimony) the rough handwritten notes are to be retained. The defendants argue that these FD 302s allowed the primary government witness Cobb to testify falsely. They also dispute the government's conclusion that these two FD 302s form the only basis for their Brady violation allegations. Robert Alfred Kohn, who was indicted with Taylor and who pled guilty as previously cited. Kohn also became a government informant later in the investigation. The government's memorandum expands on several of these arguments, but, as mentioned earlier in this order, the specifics of the allegations will be addressed later in this order. The motions filed in connection with the initial trials have been incorporated by the defendants with the motions to dismiss filed post-remand in these matters. Cobb testified at the Long trial that he knew Long was not accepting a bribe under the circumstances in which the money was exchanged.

Taylor, 956 F.Supp. 622 (1997) 23 24 Also found in these records were copies of seven (7) checks payable to State Senator John Charles Lindsay of Marlboro County, South Carolina, including two (2) $10,000 checks and one (1) check for over $20,000. [Hearing 10/18 20/95, Taylor's Exh. 12]. Taylor was first approached about 9:00 a.m. on July 17, 1990, in the driveway of his home by three FBI agents. They requested that he accompany them to their offices. He was interviewed for approximately seven hours, during which time he admitted receipt of monies from Cobb that he considered to be campaign contributions. Late in the afternoon, Taylor acquiesced to appearing before the Grand Jury. He was not told he was a target of the investigation, was not given a Miranda warning before testifying, and was not asked in the Grand Jury how he categorized the monies he received from Cobb. Following his testimony, he was taken to a local motel where agents stayed with him overnight in shifts. Clemens testified at Taylor's trial that Taylor was kept in FBI custody because they were concerned that he was depressed to the point of being suicidal. However, they also bought him a liter of Scotch whiskey, and it is curious they chose a known depressant, alcohol, to assist him through this suicidal state. 25 Wade Ronald Crow, who was indicted with House Speaker John I. Rogers, III, and pled to one count of aiding and 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 abetting extortion under the Hobbs Act. Derrick has also pursued a defense of entrapment and cites in his memorandums and arguments to specific evidence that was withheld which he believes would have supported this defense. In light of the findings herein, the court need not address the entrapment issue. Any grounds for dismissal of the indictment of Long, outside of those for prosecutorial misconduct, need not be addressed at this time. In its opinion dated May 29, 1992, in the Taylor case, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals stated: The government argues that Cobb's testimony was not critical to its case and that his credibility was not a significant issue at trial, but a review of the transcript reveals that these arguments are ludicrous. Cobb was the cornerstone of the prosecution's case and his credibility was the paramount issue at trial. USA v. Taylor, 966 F.2d 830, 837 (4th Cir.1992). The late Thomas Magnum, a member of the South Carolina House of Representatives. Defendants further contend that SA Clemens, in fact, had previously testified at an evidentiary hearing in open court. These notes were among other Lost Trust investigation work papers Clemens maintained at his home in the Washington area. The court is aware that the government claims that Lobbyist Lee was helpful to them in the Derrick case. The only Grand Jury transcript regarding capital gains not removed from the AUSO's file cabinet at this time was the transcript of Greer's testimony which had been previously pulled from the files. Michael E. Spears, an attorney representing Cobb at that time. This incident took place only three (3) days prior to his meeting with defendant Taylor regarding Taylor's support of the parimutuel bill. Yolanda C. Courie, co-counsel for defendant Taylor. In his motion to dismiss on the grounds of entrapment, defendant Derrick claims that Cobb added Derrick to his target list in revenge for Cobb's loss of a client when Derrick would not support legislation known as the Tent Sales bill. In post- remand discovery furnished to defendants there was found a government file dated April 30, 1991, which contained what appears to be a manuscript of a proposed book by Cobb entitled The Second Burning of Columbia. The manuscript is in the form of an interview of Cobb ( R ) and his then-girlfriend, Shelly Adams ( S ), by D , later identified by the government as Doug Williams. A portion of that manuscript reads as follows: D You knew who they [the government] had files on going in? So there really was, there was a definite universe of people that you were charged with going after? R Yeah. D Did you add to that universe at all for the hell of it? R Yeah. Paul Derrick big time. [Hearing, 4/19/95, Taylor Exh. 7, p. 27]. 38 39 The government did not oppose the publication of this selected portion of the manuscript. It did oppose full publication on the basis of protection of any copyright privilege Cobb might assert. The court would take note, however, that it was inappropriate for the USAO to conduct that press conference from a courtroom in the United States Courthouse.
